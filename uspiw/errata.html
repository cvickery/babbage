  Page xvii.  Change &quot;baggage&quot; to &quot;babbage&quot; on the
  last line so that the URL for my home page becomes <a
  href="../">http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/</a>.<p>

  Page 3, Line 12.  Add the following sentence after &quot; Escape key
  before Control-V to see the version message.&quot;

  <blockquote>
  If <i>that</i> doesn't work, enter the command, <i>VISUAL=emacs</i>
  before typing Control-V.
  </blockquote>

  Page 5, Line 4.  Change the url that begins
  &quot;<code>http://research</code> &#x2026; &quot; to <a
  href="http://public.research.att.com/~gsf/download/gen/ast-ksh.html">http://public.research.att.com/~gsf/download/gen/ast-ksh.html</a>.<p>

  Page 7, Line 2.  Change the url that begins
  &quot;<code>http://research</code> &#x2026; &quot; to <a
  href="http://public.research.att.com/~gsf/uwin/uwin.html">http://public.research.att.com/~gsf/uwin/uwin.html</a>.<p>

  Page 23, line 8.  Change .ksrhc to .kshrc.<p>

  Page 31, line 8.  Change <code>f113</code> to
  <code>f133</code>.

  Page 37, line 9 from the bottom.  
  You should have seen "This is /bin/ksh" rather than "This is
  s131".  Your output would vary, depending on the actual path
  to <i>ksh</i> on your system.  Under UWIN, it might show up
  as "-ksh" indicating that it is your login shell.  The
  output shown was taken from interactions I had with ksh
  under UWIN at the time the book was written and does not
  reflect the correct behavior of ksh, as seen on current
  systems.<p>


  Page 38, lines 17 and 25.  Same error as Page 37, line
  -9.<p>

  Page 41, lines -3 and -10.  Same error as Page 37, line
  -9.<p>

  Page 42, line 13.  Same error as Page 37, line -9.<p>

  Page 49, line 9.  Change &quot;<code>-l</code>&quot; to
  &quot;<code>-lF</code>&quot; near the end of the line.<p>

  Page 56, five lines from the bottom.  Change &quot;...&nbsp;argument for
  -1.14&nbsp;...&quot; to &quot;...&nbsp;argument for <code>-o</code>, and
  -1.14&nbsp;...&quot;.<p>

  Page 99, line 4.  Change &quot;<code>out &lt;</code>&quot; to
  &quot;<code>&lt; out</code>&quot;.<p>

  Page 104, Line 5.  Change &quot;<code>&gt;/</code>&quot; to
  &quot;<code>&gt;|</code>&quot;.<p>

  Page 106, Answer f.  &quot;It means that both
  <u><code>stdout</code></u> and <code>stderr</code> are redirected
  ...&quot;<p>

  Page 114, Question 2.  Should end with &quot;question 1&quot; instead
  of &quot;questions 1.&quot;.<p>

  Page 114, Question 3.  The last symbol should be <code>&gt;|</code>
  instead of <code>&gt;1</code>.<p>

  Pages 119 to 121, Tasks lettered &quot;a)&quot; through &quot;e)&quot; 
  should be lettered &quot;d)&quot; through &quot;h)&quot;.<p>

  Page 153, line 15.  The M in MONDAY should be boldface.<p>

  Page 159, Question 1d.  Put quotes around
  <blockquote>&quot;<code>function overwrite {</code>&quot;</blockquote>
  and around <blockquote>&quot;<code>overwrite()
  {.</code>&quot;</blockquote><p>

  Page 184 After the Tip.  Insert the heading, &quot;<b>4.2.2
  Answers</b>.&quot;<p>

  Page 200, seven lines from the bottom.  The shaded box that says
  &quot;4.3.4 Answers&quot; should be a section heading that says
  &quot;Lab 4.3 Answers&quot;.<p>

  &quot;name&quot; to &quot;named&quot; at the end of the line.<p>

  Page 218, line 8.  Change &quot;Run
  a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command
  ...&quot; to &quot;Run a <code>print</code> command ...&quot;<p>

  Page 243, line 6.  The line, "<code>getopts ab: optletter</code>," must
  be repeated a second time for the error message to occur.<p>

  Pages 256 through 321 (All of Chapter 6).  The running head should be
  &quot;Advanced Variable Usage&quot; rather than &quot;ADVANCED VARIABLE
  USAGE.&quot;<p>

  Page 267, middle of the page.  Change
  &quot;<code>y&nbsp;=&nbsp;x/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;y&nbsp;*&nbsp;4</code>&quot;
  to
  &quot;<code>y&nbsp;=&nbsp;x/2,&nbsp;z&nbsp;=&nbsp;y&nbsp;*&nbsp;4</code>&quot;<p>

  Page 267, last line.  Change &quot;...&nbsp;inside a
  script&nbsp;...&quot; to &quot;... inside a dotted
  script&nbsp;...&quot;.<p>

  Page 268, Line 2.  Change &quot;inside a script&nbsp;...&quot; to
  &quot;inside a dotted script (or inside a function)&nbsp;...&quot;.<p>

  Page 337, 9 lines from the bottom of the page.  The first line of the
  script should not have an &quot;a&quot; after the pound sign.  It
  should look like this:

  <pre> # s712 -- Print a message if option a is set. </pre>

  Page 342, second line.  Insert a backslash ( <code>\</code> ) between
  <code>&quot;$1&quot;</code> and &quot;<code>is</code>&quot;, and move
  &quot;<code>is</code>&quot; to the beginning of the next line.<p>

  Page 364, between the first and second lines.  Add: &quot;If the
  function does not execute a <code>return</code> statement, the exit
  code is that of the last command executed within the
  function.&quot;.<p>

  Page 370, lines 5-9 should look like this:
  <pre>
      #  The variables a_opt, b_opt, and c_opt will be
      #  either empty strings or the string &quot;on&quot;,
      #  depending on the command line, when this
      #  function terminates.
  </pre>

  Page 383.  In both functions, insert a line of code that says
  &quot;<code>shift</code>&quot; between the lines that begin with
  &quot;<code>do</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>done</code>&quot;.<p>

  Page 407, 6<sup>th</sup> line from the top.  Put a backslash ( <code>\
  </code>) after the word &quot;Unrecognized.&quot;<p>

  Page 429, line 5.  Change "With the same file in your ... " to "With the
  same files in your ..."<p>

  Page 432, line 2, change <code>((i=1; i&lt;6; i++))</code> to
  <code>((i=1; i&lt;=6 i++))</code>.<p>

  Page 432, line 3.  Add a colon after "digit" so the line looks like
  this:
  <pre>
      print [[:alpha:][:digit:]]
  </pre>

  Page 442, after line 2.  Add the following answers for questions d) and
  e) of Exercise 10.1.2:
  <blockquote>
  d)  What is the difference between the outputs of the first two
  commands?

    <blockquote>The first command prints all one-character file names (1, 2,
    3, 4, 5, 6, a, b,c, d, and e), whereas the second one prints all
    filenames that end with a character (<i>i.e.</i>, all of
    them).</blockquote>

  e)  What is the difference between the outputs of the second two
  commands?

    <blockquote>The second two print the same thing (the names of all the
    files), for similar reasons.  The second prints all filenames that
    <i>end</i> with a character, whereas the third prints all filenames
    that <i>start</i> with a character.</blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  Page 443, line 15, change <code>((i=1; i&lt;6; i++))</code> to
  <code>((i=1; i&lt;=6 i++))</code>.<p>

  Page 444, bottom of the page.  Add the following paragraph:

  <blockquote> The command on line 1022 prints all file names that start
  with any character that is <i>not</i> (the first exclamation mark
  indicates negation) an exclamation mark (the second exclamation mark is
  escaped, so it is a literal part of the pattern).  In this case, there
  are no file names that start with an exclamation mark, so all file
  names are printed.</blockquote>

  Page 459, line 19.  Insert the following answer, and change the letters
  of answers e) and f) to f) and g) respectively.

  <blockquote>

  e) Why are there quotes around the command substitution of the
  <code>vi</code> command?

    <blockquote>Answer: If the name of the file to be edited has a space
    in it, the quotes insure that the <code>vi</code> command will
    receive the proper name of a single file to edit. </blockquote>

  </blockquote>

  Page 470, 7<sup>th</sup> line from the bottom.  Change "shortest right
  pattern" to "longest right pattern" for the <code>%%</code> operator.<p>

  Page 482, line 2.  Change the open parentheses to an open brace so the
  line looks like the following:

  <pre>
        ${abc=abc}
  </pre>

  Page 487, 7<sup>th</sup> line from the bottom.  Change
  "<code>[-U&nbsp;[n]&nbsp;]</code>" to
  "<code>[-u&nbsp;fd]</code>".<p>

  Page 507, 5<sup>th</sup> line from the bottom.  Change
  &quot;(<code>/t</code>)&quot; to &quot;(<code>\t</code>)&quot;.<p>

  Page 552, last line.  Change F to B.<p>

  Page 561, first line.  Change &quot;<code><b>-et</b></code>&quot; to
  &quot;<code><b>-ef</b></code>&quot;.<p>

  Page 565, line 10.  Change &quot;<b>exec</b>
  [<i>n</i>]<code>&lt;</code> <i>writefile</i>&quot; to &quot;<b>exec</b>
  [<i>n</i>]<code>&gt;</code> <i>writefile</i>&quot;.<p>

  Page 568, Lab 3.2, Question 4.  Add this after the explanation:
  &quot;If a command does not consume all of <code>stdin</code>, the
  remaining input will be passed to the next command(s) in the group
  until either all the input has been consumed or all the commands have
  completed execution.&quot;.<p>

  Page 572, third line from bottom of page.  Make &quot;done&quot;
  boldface.<p>

  Page 580, third item.  Delete the space between the
  &quot;<code>:</code>&quot; and the &quot;<code>=</code>&quot; so it
  looks like, &quot;${<i>parameter</i><b>:=</b><i>word</i>}&quot;.<p>

  Page 581.  Change
  &quot;${<i>parameter</i><code>#</code><i>word</i>}&quot; to
  &quot;${<i>parameter</i><code>#</code><i>pattern</i>} in line 1 of the
  first column.  Similarly for lines 2-4 of the first column.<p>

  Page 601 (not a numbered page).  Change 496 to 596 as the number of
  pages in this book.<p>

  Page 606 (not a numbered page).  Replace this page with one that
  describes the correct CD-ROM.
