<H3>Project Management</H3>

<p>1 Point

<p>Each assignment is to be submitted by sending an email message
that tells the pathname to the project directory on Panther 7.
The project directory is to contain only the Makefile for the
project, the source files, and the help files.  Typing "make"
in the project directory is to cause the entire project to be
built.

<H3>User Documentation</H3>

<p>3 Points

<p>Is there a help file with the same file name as the program and an
appropriate extension (.hlp)?  Is the help file written for the proper
audience (end users)?  Does the structure match that of standard iRMX
help files; is the information well organized?  Is the information
presented clearly, completely, and yet concisely?

<H3>Coding Style and Documentation</H3>

<p>3 Points

<p>Are source files documented according to the <A
HREF="coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</A> for this course?
Does the code make efficient use of the C language.  Does it use iRMX
system calls appropriately and efficiently?

<H3>Code Functionality</H3>

<p>3 Points

<p>The criteria for this section vary from assignment to assignment.

<H3>Project Grade</H3>
