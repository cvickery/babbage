<H2>Overview</H2>

<b>NOTE: </b>I am not teaching CS-704 this term.
The material in this page is drawn from a comparison between CS-701 and
CS-704 that was written for the Fall 1995 term.<P>

The focus of CS-704 is to introduce you to systems programming
using a real-time operating system. The development tools available
to us are more primitive than the ones used in CS-701, but in
exchange we get to write programs that genuinely perform such
low-level operations as interrupt, process, and memory management.<P>

CS-704 uses a relatively obscure real-time operating system (Intel's
iRMX) running on PCs, but it is gaining in importance as the multimedia
revolution makes the issues of real-time computing more visible
to the computing public. We will <I>not</I> be doing multimedia
computing in CS-704, but we will be dealing with fundamental issues
of real-time computing methodology.<P>

<H2>Your Background</H2>

Students who take CS-704 are expected to have
completed the equivalent of a Queens College undergraduate major
in computer science. For many Master's students, this requirement
is met by taking our CS-601, CS-602, and CS-640 courses. In addition,
CS-700 is a prerequisite for CS-704.<P>

CS-704 assumes that you already know how to program in C.
To give you an idea of the degree of programming competence I
expect, here is a list of some of the things you should be able
to do in C before you start:
<UL>
<LI>Process command line arguments.
<LI>Perform basic file operations (open, read, write, close).
<LI>Create a data structure that contains various data types,
including pointers to functions and pointers to structures.
<LI>Build and traverse a linked list using <I>malloc()</I> to
allocate the nodes dynamically.
<LI>Be familiar with string processing functions from the standard
library (<I>strcmp(), strcat(), strtok(), strtol(), etc.</I>).
<LI>Be familiar with the use of header files.
<LI>Be able to put functions in different source code files, link
them together, and share information between the functions.
</UL>

In addition, I will expect you to have studied operating system
principles, including process scheduling, process synchronization,
memory management, and I/O design before taking CS-704.<P>

Remember that each graduate student in the Computer Science Department
has an account on the Academic Computer Center's timesharing system
running Unix, <I>qcunix,</I> which you can use to bring your C
programming up to speed before the course begins.<P>

<H2>CS704</H2>

The programming environment for this course will be Intel's iRMX
real-time operating system. Real-time systems must support traditional
systems programming operations, such as concurrency control and
memory management, by application developers. Thus, the resources
that are available for real-time development are ideal for studying
systems programming techniques.<P>

iRMX for Windows is an extended version of iRMX III that runs
on any machine that runs DOS (provided it has an 80386 or higher
processor, at least 6 MB of RAM, and 15 MB of disk space). Copies
of iRMX for Windows will be available for students to install
on their own computers if they wish. There will also be computers
running iRMX for Windows in the OS Lab. Microsoft Windows is not
required in order to run iRMX for Windows, but may be run if desired.
To use iRMX for Windows, you boot DOS, and then load iRMX, which
encapsulates DOS as an iRMX task. Both operating systems share
the same DOS file system.<P>

Projects will be done in C using standard development tools: Intel's
C compiler and linker, (<I>iC386 </I>and<I> BND386),</I>the<I>
make </I>utility<I>, </I>and <I>SoftScope</I>, the iRMX debugger.
The development tools may be run under either iRMX or DOS, and
there is a version of <I>SoftScope</I> that runs under Windows,
so you can code and build projects without access to iRMX, although
you have to have an iRMX system to run and test your code.  Standard
DOS/Windows development tools (Borland or Microsoft C, for example)
are <I>not</I> compatible with iRMX at the present time, although
a new release of the operating system due during the Fall will
support both Borland and Microsoft C when it becomes available.
 The C++ language is <I>not</I> compatible with iRMX and will
not be supported in the next release either.  iRMX for Windows
is not compatible with Windows95 either.<P>

Projects will emphasize I/O, concurrency, and object management
in a networked environment. Students will work individually on
all projects. Students will be expected to be reasonably familiar
with DOS and Unix<I> before</I> starting the course. Programming
projects will include complete documentation of the code, and
at least one project will consist of a set of experiments that
will be written up as a research report.<P>
