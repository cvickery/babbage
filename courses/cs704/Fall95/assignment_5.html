<h2>CS-704 Device Driver Assignment</h2>

<dl>
<dt><b>Due Date:</b><dd>December 19, 1995

<dt><b>Deliverables:</b>

<dd> When your program is ready for grading, send
me e-mail telling me the name of the project directory, which I will assume
is under your home directory on Panther7.  The project directory is to be
empty except for a Makefile, source file(s), and a Notes file telling me
what your program does and any information I might need to test it.
When I type "Make" in the project
directory, all executables for this assignment are to be built without
remarks, warnings, or errors.  All code must conform to the <A
HREF="../coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</A> for this course.</p>

<dt><b>Program Description</b>

<dd> The program is to act as a terminal emulator.  Whatever the user types
at the console keyboard is to be written to a serial port, and whatever is
received at the serial port is to be displayed on the user's console
screen.  The program takes two command line arguments: the base address
of the UART registers for the serial port being used, and the encoded
interrupt level for that port.  For a standard PC, the arguments for
the four COM ports would be:

<p><ol>
<li>0x3F8, 0x48
<li>0x2F8, 0x38
<li>0x3E8, 0x48
<li>0x2E8, 0x38
</ol></p>

<dt><b>Development Steps</b>

<dd> This exercise is to be done as a sequence of steps.  Because of time
constraints, all but Step 1 are optional for this assignment. (!)</p>

<dl>
<dt>Step 1

<dd>Construct a testing environment for this exercise.  Connect either a
terminal or a modem to one of the COM ports on a PC, and make sure the
connection works.  In the lab, you will have to disable logins on the
terminal attached to the computer you are going to work on.  Edit the
file <code>:config:terminals</code> and change the first line of that
file from a '2' to a '1'.  You have to reboot the computer for this change
to take effect.  You can test the change after rebooting by issuing the
following commands:</p>

<code><ul>
<li>attachdevice com1 as t p
<li>dir :$: to :t:
<li>copy :t:
<li>detachdevice :t:
</ul></code>

<p>The <i>attachdevice</i> command is correct only if the terminal is on com1;
the third line of the <code>:config:terminals</code> file tells you which port
it is actually connected to.  The output of the <i>dir</i> command should
appear on the terminal's screen, and whatever you type on the terminal's
keyboard should be displayed on the iRMX console while the <i>copy</i>
command is running.  Type <code>^Z</code> at the beginning of a line on
the terminal to terminate the <i>copy</i> command.  If that doesn't work,
type <code>^C</code> on the iRMX console.</p>

<p>Now use SoftScope or the <i>monitor</i> command to get to the SDM
debug monitor.  You should be able to use the SDM <i>o 2f8,41</i> and
<i>i 2f8</i> commands to send characters (the letter 'A' in this
example) to the terminal's screen and to read characters from its
keyboard. (Address 2f8 is for COM2.)  In SoftScope, the commands would
be <i>port 2f8 = 41h</i> and <i>port 2f8</i>.</p>

<p>Use these commands to determine the settings of the divisor latch
and line status register of the UART.  Tell what you found in the Notes
file in the project directory for this exercise.</p>

<dt>Step 2

<dd>Write a program that reads the contents of all the UART registers
and displays their values in hexadecimal on the console.  Be sure the
values make sense before proceeding.  ("All" means all readable registers,
including those that share addresses.)  The base address of the UART's
registers comes from a command line argument.</p>

<dt>Step 3

<dd>Modify your program so that it consists of two tasks.  One task calls
<i>rqsetinterrupt()</i> and becomes the interrupt task for the serial
port.  The interrupt handler does nothing but call <i>rqsignalinterrupt()</i>
and the interrupt task does nothing but send a unit to a semaphore each
time it returns from <i>rqwaitinterrupt()</i>.  The second task waits for
a unit at the semaphore, and reads from the UART's IID, LSR,  and RBR registers
when it receives a unit; it displays the hexadecimal value of the IID and
LSR registers, and the character value of the RBR.  If the RBR character
is the letter 'q' the second task calls <i>rqresetinterrupt()</i> and exits.

<p>The interrupt level is specified as a second command line argument by
the user.
Be sure one of the tasks calls <i>rqesetmaxpriority()</i> before the
interrupt task calls <i>rqsetinterrupt()</i>.</p>


<dt>Step 4

<dd>Modify your program so there is a third task.  The interrupt task
notifies this task when there is a TBE interrupt by means of another
semaphore, and the interrupt task signals only RBF interrupts only to
the reading task.</p>

<p>Notes that this design is simpler (by two tasks and two
bounded buffers) than the design presented in class on December 14.</p>

<dt>Step 5

<dd>Fix the code up so that it works like a terminal emulator!  Use
<i>rqsspecial()</i> so you can read characters from the console one at
a time without echoing them.  You have to use the <code>get/set
terminal attibutes</code> subfunctions (4 and 5) of <i>rqsspecial()</i>
so that the connection mode is <code>transparent</code>,  The
documentation for <i>rqaspecial</i> gives more information about how to
set up the arguments to <i>rqsspecial()</i> than the documentation
for <i>rqsspecial()</i> itself does.</p>

</dl>

<dt><b>The Notes File</b>

<dd>Tell how far you got in the exercise in the Notes file that you leave
in your project directory.</p>

<dt><b>Grading</b>

<dd>Completing Step 1 of this exercise counts as 2% of your final grade.
Any additional work you do on this exercise counts as extra credit
for the course.  The only documentation you need to supply for this
exercise is the Notes file.</p>
