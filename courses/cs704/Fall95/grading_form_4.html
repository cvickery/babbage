PROJECT MANAGEMENT
------------------

[Each assignment is to be submitted by sending an email message
that tells the pathname to the project directory on Panther 7.
The project directory is to contain only the Makefile for the
project, the source files, and the help files.  Typing "make"
in the project directory is to cause the entire project to be
built.]

audience (end users)?  Does the structure match that of standard iRMX

presented clearly, completely, and yet concisely?]
