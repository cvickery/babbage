<h2>CS-704 Automaton Server Assignment</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Due Date:</b><dd>November 28, 1995

<dt><b>Deliverables:</b><dd>When your programs are ready for grading, send
me e-mail telling me the name of the project directory, which I will assume
is under your home directory on Panther7.  The project directory is to be
empty except for a Makefile, two (or more) Source files, and two help
files, to be named appropriately.  If I type "Make" in the project
directory, all executables for this assignment are to be built without
remarks, warnings, or errors.  All code must conform to the <A
HREF="../coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</A> for this course.

<dt><b>Server Description</b><dd>One program you will write is to act
as a <i>server</i> program, a program that interacts with <i>client</i>
programs to provide computational services.  In this document, the program
will be called <i>server</i>, but your are to make up your own meaningful
name for this program.  The help file for this program will be named
<i>server</i><code>.hlp</code>.

<p>There will be two parts to <i>server</i>, a front-end that interacts
with clients by exchanging iRMX mailbox messages, and a back-end which
simulates the operation of Finite State Automata (FSA's), as specified below.
<i>Server</i> will be designed so that it can be run as a sysloaded command
under iRMX, supporting the -w and -u sysload flags as described in class
and in the file <code>\dosrmx\readme.txt</code>.

<p>The front end of the server receives messages from one data mailbox,
which will be called the "request mailbox" in this assignment, and it
will send messages to another mailbox, which will be called the "reply
mailbox" in this assignment.  In addition, the server will write messages
to a text file, which will be called the "server logfile" in this
assignment.  The behavior of the server can be defined in terms of the
messages it receives, sends, and writes to the logfile:

<p><dl>

<dt><b>Request Messages</b><dd>Request messages fall into four general
categories: Definition, Assignment, Query, and Termination.  Definition
messages are used to define FSA's; Assignment messages assign values to
the variables that control the automata; Query messages request information
about the values of variables and the states of automata; Termination
requests tell the server to terminate.

<dt><b>Reply Messages</b><dd>The server sends a message to the reply
mailbox for every Query or Termination message it receives from the
request mailbox.  Reply messages are timestamped and formatted so
that they can be read easily by a human.

<dt><b>Logfile Messages</b><dd>All reply messages are written to the
logfile, along with messages logging all variable and state changes.
</dl>

<dt><b>Client Description</b><dd>The client program is used by a person
to send messages to the server and to view replies from the server.  Each
time the client is run it goes through two phases.  First it examines its
command line arguments and formats a single request message to send to
the request mailbox.  If there are no arguments, this phase is skipped.
Second, the client retrieves all messages waiting at the reply mailbox
and displays them on the user's screen.  Then the client exits.

<dt><b>Implementation Strategy</b><dd>This project is to be implemented
as a sequence of steps.  At each step (except the last) you are to have
a tested and functioning, but incomplete, project.  If you do not complete all steps
by the due date, you will receive partial credit for the steps that you
do have complete.  Here is an outline of the steps you are to follow
in developing this program:

<p><dl>

<dt><b>Step 1</b><dd>First construct a server program that responds properly
to <i>sysload</i> commands with the -w and -u options.  Test to be sure the
program does not cause <i>sysload -w</i> to wait more than a fraction of
a second for initialization, and that the program does, indeed, delete
itself in response to a <i>sysload -u</i> command.  Check to be sure you
can re-load the command after unloading it.

<dt><b>Step 2</b><dd>Augment the server so that it creates a logfile to
which it writes a time-stamped message when it initializes and another
time-stamped message when it terminates.  Be sure you can read the
initialization message while the server is running, not just after it
terminates.  Each message written to the logfile is to contain the time
and date plus some explanatory text, all on one line.  I suggest that
you use the library
functions <i>time()</i> and <i>ctime()</i> to format the timestamps.

<dt><b>Step 3</b><dd>Construct a client program that will send a termination
message to the server's request mailbox and display a reply message confirming
that the server has deleted itself.  Be sure both the client and server can
be run repeatedly.  Be sure the client behaves in a reasonable manner if it
is run when the server is not loaded.  The termination message shall consist
of the word "terminate" encoded as a C string.  If you wish, you may
write your code to accommodate unambiguous abbreviations of messages.  From
this point forward, however, all messages sent to the server must be
syntactically correct.  For example, for this step, it would be incorrect
to send any message to the server other than a "terminate" string.  At this
stage, the server will be able to handle two different messages arriving
at its request mailbox:  A message that starts with 0xFFDD is a "delete
yourself" message from <i>sysload</i>, and a message that starts with the
string "terminate" is a message from <i>client.</i>  Only a client message
should cause a reply to be sent to the reply mailbox, but either message
should cause a termination message to be written to the logfile before
the server exits.

<dt><b>Step 4</b><dd>Implement variables.  For this assignment, a
variable looks like a C-language identifier, and may take on the boolean
values of <i>zero</i> and <i>one</i>.  (Equivalent names for the two values
are <i>off</i> and <i>on</i> or <i>reset</i> and <i>set</i>).  The user may
type <i>"client set <gt>x<lt>"</i> or <i>"client reset <gt>x<lt>"</i> or
<i>"client toggle <gt>x<lt>"</i>, where <i><gt>x</i> is any variable name.
These commands will cause the client to send corresponding messages to the
request mailbox.  How you encode these messages is up to you.
The server shall recognize the three types of messages, and shall create
the named variable if it does not already exist, and then shall send a
message to the reply mailbox telling the name of the variable and its
current value.  (Your help file for <i>client</i> will tell users what
it means to toggle a variable that does not already exist.

<p>If the user types <i>"client query variables"</i> the client and
server shall cooperate to produce a list of all defined variables and
their current values.

<p>The server must be implemented as two or more source files at this
point.  One file is to contain the definition of <i>main()</i> and all
global variables.  Other function definitions are to be in a separate
source file (or files).  When <i>main()</i> receives a message having
to do with variables, it is to call a separate function to process the
message.

<dt><b>Step 5</b><dd>Define Automata.  We define an FSA as a named thread
of execution whose behavior is determined by a set of states and a set of
transitions from those states.  Each FSA has one unique state known as its
<i>start</i> state, and another unique state known as its <i>end</i> or
<i>final</i> state.  There can be any number of other states.  Each state
except <i>final</i> is connected to one or more other states by a set of
transitions.  Each transition is specified by a list of variable/value
pairs that tells what input conditions are to cause the transition (the
<i>input list</i>), a list
of variable/value pairs that are to be output when the transition
is taken (the <i>output list</i>), and the name of the state the automaton
is to transfer to when the transition is taken (the <i>next state</i>).
In this step, you are only to allow the user to set up the data structures
to define automata, not to create the tasks that will act as automata.

<p>To define an automaton, the user will enter a sequence of <i>client</i>
commands, which we will describe using an annotated example:
<dl>
<dt>Start the definition of an FSA named alpha
<dd><code>% client define alpha</code>
<dt>Define the <i>start</i> state for automaton <i>alpha</i>
<dd><code>% client start: abc = 1, def = 0; abc = 0; 1</code>
<dt>Define state <i>1</i> for automaton <i>alpha</i>
<dd><code>% client 1: def = 1; ghi = 1; end
<br>% client 1: def = 0; ghi = 1; 0</code>
<dt>Finish the definition of automaton <i>alpha</i>
<dd><code>% end
<br>Automaton alpha has 3 states.
<br>%</code>
</dl>

<p>The <i>define</i> command is used to start the definition of a new FSA.
The definition continues across <i>client</i> commands until an <i>end</i>
command is entered.  Each line between the <i>define</i> and <i>end</i>
commands defines one transition for one state of the automaton.  Each
transition line starts with the name of the state, an input list, a
semicolon, an output list, another semicolon, and the name of the next
state.  State names are the reserved names "start" and "end," and integers.
In the example above, the first transition defined is for the start state.
It says that if the variable <i>abc</i> is 1 or the variable <i>def</i> is
0, the variable <i>abc</i> is to be set to zero and the automaton is to
transfer to state 1.  The second transition line says that if the automaton
is in state 1 and the variable <i>def</i> becomes 1, the automaton is to
set the variable <i>ghi</i> to 1 and to transfer to the end state.  The
third transition line says that if the automaton is in state 1 and the
variable <i>def</i> becomes 0, the automaton is to set the variable
<i>ghi</i> to 1, and transfer back into state 1 again.  When the <i>end</i>
line is entered, the server sends a message to the reply mailbox confirming
the name of the automaton and the number of states.

<p>This step of the project is an exercise in string processing and
data structure construction.  Augmenting the client program for this
step is trivial; it just passes command line strings on to the server.
Your client is not required to check the syntax or semantics of the
command line, but it must make sure that each command fits within
the 128 bytes allowed by the <i>rqsenddata()</i> system call.  We will
discuss the rationale behind these design decisions in class.

<p>The server must dynamically create data structures for each automaton,
each state of each automaton, and each transition for each state.  The
only way to verify if these structures are being set up correctly is to
look at them at run time using SoftScope.  For this step you will run
your server under SoftScope instead of loading it using <i>sysload</i>
and use SoftScope's "system" command to run the client program while
debugging the server.  Alternatively, you can use a second terminal
attached to your computer to log in a second time.  Use one login
session to run the server under SoftScope and the other login session
to issue <i>client</i> commands.

<dt><b>Step 6</b><dd>Implement the automata.  Each time the user
completes the definition of an automaton, create a task to interpret
the data structures you implemented in Step 5.  Each time a variable
changes value, send a message to each automaton task informing it of
the change.  Automata as well as <i>client</i> commands can cause
variables to change state.  The server has to be able to determine
the current state of each automaton so that it can respond to a
<i>"client query automata"</i> command with a list of automata names
and their states.

<dt><b>Step 7</b><dd><b>Optional</b>  Add the option of timed transitions
to the input lists.  An integer with no variable name in an input list
means the transition will be taken if the specified interval (number of
hundredths of a second) elapses after the automaton enters the state.
