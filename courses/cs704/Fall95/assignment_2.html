<pre>
Date Due:	October 10, 1995

Deliverables:	1.  A program that determines the time it takes to do
		the following operations under iRMX:
		     A near function call.
		     A far function call.
		     Make a kernel call to get the current time.
		     Make an iRMX call to get the current time.
		     Switch from one task to another using a Nucleus
		     semaphore.
		2.  A help file that tells users how to use your program.
		3.  A report that presents the results you obtained using
		    your program.

Requirements:	1.  All timing values are to be displayed in microsecond
		    units.
		2.  The program must accept command line arguments
		    consisting of (a) any subset of the keywords
		    {"near" "far" "kernel" "rmx" "switch"}, indicating
		    which of the operations specified above are to be
		    tested.  Alternatively, the first argument could be
		    the keyword "all," meaning all members of the set
		    and (b) an optional numeric parameter specifying
		    how many iterations are to be averaged to do each
		    timing test.
		3.  The program must compile and link without remarks,
		    warnings, or errors; it must handle incorrect 
		    command line arguments "gracefully."
		4.  The code must be documented according to the
		    <A HREF="../coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</A> for this course.
		5.  The help file is to be in the standard format for iRMX
		    command help files (or Unix man pages).  The help file
		    is a plain text file suitable for viewing with the "more"
		    command.
		6.  The report is to consist of a statement of what data
		    were collected and how, a narrative description of
		    the data obtained, one or more tables summarizing the
		    data, and a summary statement that draws conclusions
		    about the relative speeds of the various options tested.
