<h2>SoftScope Exercise</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Due Date</b><dd>October 17, 1995
<dt><b>Deliverables</b><dd>Hand in a marked up printout of the
information specified below.
<dt><b>Particulars</b><dd>This is an exercise in using SoftScope
to examine system parameters using the "v<i>x</i>" commands.
</dl>
<p>For your second assignment, you used some code I gave you to
display the kernel tick ratio for the system you were running.
For this exercise, you are to use the SoftScope <i>log</i> command
to capture a debugging session in a file.  You are then to edit that
file to produce a written report showing how you used SoftScope's
"v<i>x</i>" commands to answer the following questions.
<ul>
<li> What is the value of the token for the root job?
<li> What token is cataloged in the root job's object directory
using the name RQSYSINFO?
<li> What type of iRMX object does the RQSYSINFO token represent?
<li> Dump the RQSYSINFO object, determine the offset of the Kernel
Tick Ratio from :include:sys/sysinfo.h, and circle the KTR in the
dump.
<li> Determine the token for the job for the ss command you are running,
and show the command name in a dump of the memory segment
cataloged in that job's object directory under the name R?H$C$NAME.
<li> Step through your code for determining the context switch
rate until the program has created both semaphores and both
tasks.  Use the vt command to display the information about one
of the semaphores and one of the tasks.  Circle the task's
priority in the display.
<li> Demonstrate that you can single step through one of the
tasks your program created for the last assignment.
</ul>

<p> The printout you hand in for this assignment will be of a text
file you prepared using Aedit.  In addition to the cut and paste
operations mentioned in class, you might want to look at the
pf (paragraph fill) and sm (set margin) commands to help you
format your text file.</p>
