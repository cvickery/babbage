<H2>CS-704 Grading Form for Fall '95 Assignments</H2>

<H3>Project Management</H3>

<p>1 Point

<p>Each assignment is to be submitted by sending an email message
that tells the pathname to the project directory on Panther 7.
The project directory is to contain only the Makefile for the
project, the source files, and the help files.  Typing "make"
in the project directory is to cause the entire project to be
built.
<p>[A makefile is not required for this project.]

<H3>User Documentation</H3>

<p>3 Points

<p>Is there a help file with the same file name as the program and an
appropriate extension (.hlp)?  Is the help file written for the proper
audience (end users)?  Does the structure match that of standard iRMX
help files; is the information well organized?  Is the information
presented clearly, completely, and yet concisely?


<H3>Coding Style and Documentation</H3>

<p>3 Points

<p>Are source files documented according to the <A
HREF="coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</A> for this course?
Does the code make efficient use of the C language.  Does it use iRMX
system calls appropriately and efficiently?

<H3>Code Functionality</H3>

<p>3 Points

<p>[Are command line arguments handled properly?  Are the results
given in microseconds?  Do the results look reasonable?]

<H3>Project Grade</H3>

<p>Projects are graded on a ten point scale.
Late points are deducted at a rate of 0.1 point per day.

<H3>Report Grade</H3>
<p>[For this assignment, you were to provide a report that summarizes your
findings.  The report was graded separately on the basis of clarity of
writing, data presentation, and
reasonableness of the conclusions drawn.]
