        <p>
          There is a lot of information about the Galton Board on the web. Here are two,
          but feel free to explore. (Don’t forget to come back here!)

      <h3>Reading Assignment</h3>
      <div>
        <p>Read chapters 0-5 of the Christian book.</p>
        <p>
          You should already have read chapters 0-3, so this is just to make sure
          you got it all.

      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Why is the machine in the video named “Frances?”</li>
            <li>Look at a few of the other Galton Boards on YouTube. Many of them are not
            very “good.” How would you decide whether a board is “good” or not? Why do you
            think it's hard to build a good one?
            </li>
            <li>
              How many bins would there be in a Galton Board with 7 rows of pins?
            </li>
            <li>
              A Galton Board is not a binary tree. How many bins would there be in a
              binary tree with seven rows?
            </li>
            <li>Draw a Galton board with 5 rows and a binary tree with 5 rows.</li>
            <li>
              Number the bins of a 5-row Galton board left-to-right, starting at 0. For
              each bin list all the sequences of left (indicated by “0”) and right
              (indicated by “1”) moves a ball could take to reach that bin. The best way
              to do this is to complete the following table, and then to copy out the
              sequences that lead to each bin.
              <table>
                <tr><th colspan='5'>Pin Row No.</th><th rowspan='2'>Bin No.</th></tr>
                <tr>
                  <th>0</th><th>1</th><th>2</th><th>3</th><th>4</th>
                </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>2</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>3</td> </tr>
                <tr> <td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td> </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td colspan='6'>- 23 more table rows -</td>
                </tr>
                <tr> <td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>5</td> </tr>
              </table>
              <p>
                In this table, the rows of pins are numbered from top to bottom, starting
                at zero. For our purposes, starting the row numbers with 0 instead of 1 is
                just a convention that we will follow for “no particular reason.” So the
                top row of the table represents a ball that goes left at Row 0, then
                goes left again at Row 1, left again at Row 2, left again at Row 3, left
                again at the bottom row (Row 4), and ends up in the leftmost bin, Bin #0. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Note how the Bin No. relates to the number of right bounces a ball takes as
                it goes down the rows of pins.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, your answer to this question is to complete a table like the
                following:
              </p>
              <table>
                <tr><th>Bin No.</th><th>Sequences</th><th>Number<br/>of Sequences</th></tr>
                <tr><th>0</th><td>00000</td><td>1</td></tr>
                <tr><th>1</th><td>00001, 00010, 00100, 01000, 10000</td><td>5</td></tr>
                <tr><th>2</th><td>00011, 00101, 00110, ...</td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><th>3</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><th>4</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
                <tr><th>5</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
              </table>
            </li>
            <li>
              The <em>probability</em> that a ball will end up in a particular bin is
              the percentage of balls that end up in that bin, divided by 100. For
              example, if 75% of the balls end up in Bin 1, the probability is 0.75.
              <p>
                Since all the balls end up in some one of the bins, the sum of the
                percentages for all the bins is 100%, and the sum of the probabilities is
                thus 1.0.
              </p>
              <p>
                Add a column to the six-row table you built in Question 6 and fill in the
                probability a ball will end up in each bin. Check your work: the sum of the
                probabilities has to be 1.0. (Take the answers to 5 decimal places and
                    there will be no rounding errors.)
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              Draw a bar graph that shows the probability of a ball falling into each bin.
              Be sure to label each axis and to include the proper scale values. The Y
              axis should be drawn so the heights of the bars match the probabilities for
              each bin. This sort of graph is called a <em>probability mass
              function</em>.
              <p>
                Does it look like a “bell curve” to you?
              </p>
