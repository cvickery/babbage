<H1>CS-731: Software Practicum</H1>
</CENTER>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

CS-731 is one of three courses that Master's students may use to
satisfy the &quot;capstone requirement&quot; for the MA degree in
Computer Science at Queens College. The other two courses are CS-
732 (Research Practicum) and CS-733 (Master's Thesis).

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

<UL>

  <LI><B>Completion of the Software Semicore Requirement</B>.
  
  <BR> The software semicore courses (CS-701, CS-707, or CS-718, or a
    special topics course identified as meeting the software semicore)
    require you to do advanced programming in C, C++, or Java.

  <LI><B>Completion of 21 of the 30 credits required for the MA
  degree</B>.

  <BR> You must have completed 21 credit hours <I>before</I> the
  semester in which you take CS-731.  An exception will be made if you
  are taking 12 (or 15!) credits during your last semester in the
  program.

</UL>

<H2>Description and Requirements</H2>

Each student designs and implements a &quot;significant&quot;
programming project for this course. The definition of
&quot;significant&quot; is imprecise, but a rough guideline would be
over 1,000 lines of source code that you write in some combination of
Java, C, and C++. Note that learning a new programming language or
development environment does not contribute to the
&quot;significance&quot; of the project for the purposes of this
course. You should already be familiar with the development environment
you will use before you register for this course.<P>

There are sections with more information on [&nbsp;<a
HREF="#Picking a Project">Picking a Project</A>&nbsp;] and [&nbsp;<a
HREF="#Project Requirements">Project Requirements</A>&nbsp;] later
in this document.<p>

There are no class meetings for this course.  Each student works
individually with an advisor (typically by email) to plan and implement
his or her own project. Dr. Vickery acts as the default advisor for all
students registered for CS-731 in the Fall 2000 term. A student may
also arrange to do a project under the supervision of another faculty
member, for example if the project is to be done in the context of a
research program. But the requirements for the course described below
(a written project proposal and a written development plan) apply to
everyone regardless of who the student's advisor is.<P>

<H3>Milestones</H3>

In keeping with standard software engineering practice, each project
must proceed through a well-defined sequence of stages over the course
of the semester. In particular, all projects must meet the following
milestones, in the order indicated:

<OL>

  <LI>Approval of a Project Proposal

  <LI>Approval of a Development Plan

  <LI>Code Completion

  <LI>Project Submission

</OL>

Each of these milestones may require a number of iterations in which
you submit a draft version of your work and make revisions based on
feedback from your advisor. <P>

Each of these four milestones is described more fully in the sections
below.

<H2>Project Proposal</H2>

<B>Deliverable:</B> A document, one page or less, which describes the
nature of the project you want to do. <P>

This milestone should be completed early, typically by the end of the
second week of the semester.<P>

At this stage, you are simply deciding what your project will be. If
you already have an idea for a project, you can present it to your
advisor, and he or she will give you feedback on its suitability for
this course. The [&nbsp;<a HREF="#Project Requirements">Project
Requirements</A>&nbsp;] section below will give you an idea of what makes
a project suitable or not. If you don't know what you want to do yet,
it's a good idea to come up with some thoughts about what kind of
software you are interested in writing, even if you aren't ready to be
concrete yet. One way to approach this is to think of a program that
you would like to have but that isn't available (or costs too
much).&nbsp; There are some ideas for projects in the section <A
href="#Picking a Project">Picking a Project</A> below.

<H3>Proposal Format</H3>

Put a descriptive title for your project, centered, at the top of
the page. Put your name, also centered, directly under the title,
and put the date of your proposal, also centered, directly under
that. As you submit revised versions of your proposal, be
sure to update the date for each one.<P>

The body of the proposal has three sections: <B>Project Summary</B>,
<B>Development Environment</B>, and  <B>Project Evaluation</B>. Each
section should have a heading followed by a paragraph or two of
information.<P>

The Project Summary is where you describe what your project will do.
While it would be appropriate to tell why you think the project will be
fun or interesting to work on, you don't have to &quot;sell&quot; it to
anyone. After all, this is an academic exercise, not a commercial
product you are doing.<P>

In the Development Environment section, tell what development tools and
platform you intend to use. You are expected to write the code for your
project yourself rather than rely on code generated by a development
tool or &quot;wizard.&quot;  If you are going to reuse existing code or
if some of the code for your project will be generated automatically,
make it clear what code this will be and how it will relate to your own
code.<P>

The Evaluation section is where you describe how the final program will be
evaluated. If the program is a simple stand-alone application you might
not have anything special to say here, and this section can be omitted.
But if your project requires a particular network setup or anything out
of the ordinary in order to test and evaluate it, mention those things
here. <P>

Submit your project proposal and development plan as word processor
documents (no viruses!).  Do not submit these documents as web pages.

<H2>Development Plan</H2>

<B>Deliverable:</B>  A document that tells how you are going to develop
and test your project.<p>

Once your proposal has been approved, you are to write a development
plan that tells how you are going to code and test your project. 
Because projects for this course are &quot;significant,&quot; you
cannot just write all the code, test it, and hand it in. Rather, you
will need to develop the program systematically. A good development plan
is one that breaks the project down into easily debugged pieces of code
and that provides a logical sequence for writing the pieces so that you
can verify that all the code you have written so far is working
correctly at each step.<P>

<H3>Developmant Plan Format</H3>

The development plan document starts with the project title, your name,
and the date, just like the Project Proposal.  The body of the document
consists of a numbered sequence of headings, one for each step to be
followed in developing the project.  Most steps will have a subheading
for a use case, which is a version of the program that can be run and
tested.  Use cases should be numbered sequentially throughout the
docuement.  For example:<p>

<PRE>
    <B>Step 1</B>
    <B>Step 2</B>
      <B>Use Case 1</B>
    <B>Step 3</B>
      <B>Use Case 2</B>
    etc.
</PRE>

Each development step should have its own descriptive name, and a
paragraph telling what you will do for that step.  It should be clear
how the step contributes to the overall development of the program, and
the sequence of development steps must make sense logically.<p>

Use cases do not need names the way development steps do. Just write a
paragraph for each use case that describes a working program that
implements some subset of the overall project's functionality.  For
example, the first use case might display the user interface for the
project with none of the user controls actually doing anything yet, and
other use cases could then make the various controls do whatever they
are supposed to to.<p>

Here is a [&nbsp;<a HREF="sample_plan.html">sample development
plan</A>&nbsp;] that shows this structure.<p>

<H3>Incorporating Throwaway Code</H3>

Your development plan might include some steps in you which write code
that you will end up discarding by the time the project is finished.
This &quot;throwaway code&quot; generally falls into one of the
following three categories:

<OL>

  <LI><I>Prototypes.</I> Sometimes you know what you want part of your
  project to do, but you don't know which of several approaches to
  take. A prototype is a sample program that lets you investigate how
  something works in order to decide just how you want to proceed in
  the actual project. You might use prototypes to get a quick look at
  user interface options, or to help choose among communication
  options, for example. You might reuse some of your prototype's code
  in the actual project, but most of it gets thrown away.

  <LI><I>Stubs.</I> A stub is a piece of code that implements an
  interface without actually doing the work a real method or class
  would do.  An example of a useful stub would be when you are
  developing the user interface and want to make sure the correct
  processing routines (callback methods) are called, but haven't
  written the actual processing code yet.  You can write stubs that
  have the proper method names, receive the proper number and types of
  parameters, but which do no actual processing before returning a
  value of the proper type.  Later development steps would &quot;flesh
  out&quot; these stubs to include their full functionality.  But as
  stubs, they let you test that your user interface (for example) is
  working correctly.  Stubs are associated with a top-down development
  style, which is the one that will be appropriate for most projects.

  <LI><I>Drivers.</I> A driver is just the opposite of a stub; it is
  code that you write for testing a class or method before you write
  the actual part of the program that will use that class or method.
  The reason for drivers can be because you are doing a bottom-up
  design, but that is generally not a good idea.  More likely, you will
  write a driver when you want to generate test cases automatically for
  your methods and classes, and your application's user interface would
  make the process of running all the tests too tedious.

</OL>

Be sure you indicate clearly what throwaway code you are including in
the various steps of your development plan.

<H2>Code Completion</H2>

<B>Deliverables:</B> Source code for all the use cases listed in
the Development Plan.<P>

The code must be structured as an appropriate set of source modules.
These modules will correspond to functional or structural elements of
the project, not to use cases. A use case will normally add
functionality to one or more existing modules.<P>

As you complete each use case, test to make sure it operates properly,
and then save the source code for that case. (You can do this
systematically by using a version control system such as RCS, which is
available for both the Solaris and PC platforms.) You are to submit the
first few use cases as they are completed in order to verify that the
project is on the right track.  At some point your advisor will
probably give you permission to develop succeeding use cases without
waiting for each one to be approved.  But until that happens you must
not "work ahead" because your advisor might require changes that would
affect later development steps.<P>

<H3>Coding Guidelines</H3>

All code must be commented in a way that makes its structure,
organization, and logic easy to understand.<P>

For C and C++ code , you should follow the [&nbsp;<A
href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/coding_guideline
s.html">coding guidelines given here</A>&nbsp;]. For Java, write your
comments in standard <I>javdoc</I> format, as described in the
&quot;tools&quot; documentation of Sun's Java Development Kit (JDK). 
Javadoc comments for classes must include <CODE>@author</CODE> and
<CODE>@version</CODE> tags (use the use case number as the version
number), and javadoc comments for methods must include
<CODE>@param</CODE>, <CODE>@return</CODE>, and <CODE>@throws</CODE>
tags as appropriate.<p>

Whatever language you use, be sure each source file contains your name
and that each class and function begins with a suitable comment block
that has some sort of separator line to make it easy to find.<p>

All code must adhere to the following formatting rules:

<UL>

  <LI>Code must be consistently indented to show the nesting structure
  of the program elements (classes, methods, tests, loops, etc.)

  <LI>There must be no <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> characters in the
  file.  Configure your editor so that it substitutes spaces for tabs.

  <LI>No line of code, including comment lines, may extend past column
  71.

</UL>

<H2>Project Submission</H2>

<B>Deliverables:</B> Documentation and Source Code for the completed
project.<p>

In addition to the source code for the project, submit the following
additional documentation items:

<OL>

  <LI><B>Code Documentation.</B> Provide a list with the names of all
  the source module files and any auxiliary files that you are
  submitting.  For each file, tell how it fits into the overall
  structure of the project.

  <LI><B>User Documentation.</B> Supply information that tells people
  how to use the program(s) that make up the project. This information
  may take the form of a user's manual or online help, which may either
  be integrated with the program(s) or separate, such as UNIX-style
  <I>man</I> pages or HTML Web pages. You need to supply user
  documentation only for the complete project, not for individual use
  cases.

  <LI><B>Management Documentation.</B> Provide written information that
  tells how to build and install the software.

</OL>

In addition, submit final versions of your Project Proposal and
Development Plan documents if they have changed since being approved by
your advisor.

Some examples of projects ideas are:

<UL>

  <LI>Editors (text, sheet music, graphics, or audio, for example)

  <LI>Internet clients (telnet, http, or ftp for example)

  <LI>Games (perhaps one that you play over the network)

  <LI>Simulations or modeling programs (animated representations of
  computing algorithms; simulations of hardware or software systems,
  for example)

  <LI>Software developed as part of a research project (normally done
  as part of a faculty member's research program)

</UL>

Note that there is no requirement for your project to be novel. Just
because something has been done before doesn't mean that doing it again
wouldn't be an acceptable project. But you have to write your own
code!<P>

If you don't have an idea for a project yet, talk to your advisor about
it.<P>


<H2><A name="Project Requirements">Project Requirements</A></H2>

<UL>

  <LI>The project must demonstrate the individual student's ability to
  do independent software design and development. There will be no
  group or team projects for this course.  However, especially in the
  case of projects done as part of a faculty research project, it may
  be all right for a project to be part of a larger software system
  that was developed by others.

  <LI>The scope of the project must be such that it can
  reasonably be completed in one semester. There is no policy
  against taking an INC and finishing a project after the
  semester is over, but the project should not be so big that it
  would automatically require you to work on it for more than one
  term. This really is just a 3-credit course!

  <LI>The programming language must be Java, C, or C++.

  <LI>Each project will normally incorporate a graphical user
  interface in its design. There are projects for which a GUI is
  not appropriate, but if there is an interactive user interface,
  it should be graphical.

  <LI>The project must be self-contained. This means that at the end
  you have to be able to submit all the code for the project and that I
  must then be able to build and test it using the computing facilities
  already available in the CS Department. These facilities include Sun
  workstations using Sun's JDK or GNU C/C++ compilers, PCs running
  Microsoft Windows using Sun's JDK or Microsoft's Visual C++ and the
  Windows SDK or MFC, and Palm Organizers running PalmOS 3.1.

  <LI>The project may not use or interact with a commercial database
  product of any kind.  That is, it may not interact with an Access,
  Oracle, or any other database.  Sorry, but your idea for an eCommerce
  killer-app just can't be used for this course.

  <LI>The project must not depend on any development environment beyond
  the facilities already available in the department for building and
  evaluating the project.

  <LI>There must be no commercial restrictions on the finished project.
  You can think of the project as you would a term paper for a course.
  You can do whatever you want to with it when you are finished, but
  Queens College will keep a copy of it and may make its own use of it
  for academic purposes too.

</UL>

<H3>Grading Criteria</H3>

The project proposal and development plan will be evaluated for
content, structure, and clarity of writing.  The project itself will be
evaluated on the basis of its design, how well it works, how clearly it
is coded, and how well it is documented.<p>
