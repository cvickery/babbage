<h1>Interrupt Processing</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>I/O processing involves a complex set of interactions among
  various hardware and software components.  When an <i>application
  program</i> performs a read or write operation, for example when a
  Java program calls BufferedReader.<i>readLine()</i>, a C program
  calls <i>printf()</i> or a C++ program invokes a <i>cout</i>
  operation, the goal is to transfer some data between an I/O device
  and a <i>buffer</i>, which could be as simple as a single variable or
  as complex as a large array of bytes or characters.  For an input
  operation, the application's buffer is filled from another buffer
  that is managed by the run-time library provided by the language. 
  The run-time library, in turn, obtains the data it needs to satisfy
  the application's requests from a buffer in the operating system
  kernel.  Inside the kernel, a <i>device driver</i> fills the kernel
  buffer by reading data as it becomes available from the hardware
  interface connected to the I/O device, called a <i>device
  controller</i>.</p>

  <p>The <a href="../UART">UART Page</a> describes the mechanics of
  transferring data between a device controller and an application
  buffer in more detail.  This page describes the hardware involved in
  interrupt processing.  The model used is the one used by the Intel
  architecture, but leaves out many details.</p>  
  
  <p>For this discussion it doesn't matter whether interrupts are used
  to signal completion of individual data transfers or to indicate
  completion of an entire DMA transfer as described in the UART
  Page.</p>

  <p>In this page, we look at interrupt processing from the
  perspectives of different parts of the I/O system, starting with a
  device called a Programmable Interrupt Controller, or PIC.  Then
  we'll look at the same thing from the perspective of the CPU.</p>

<h2>Programmable Interrupt Controller</h2>

  <p>There are three hardware components involved in interrupt
  processing, a Device Controller (DC), the CPU, and the Programmable
  Interrupt Controller (PIC).  The nature of the Device Controller and
  the software that runs on the CPU is described in the <a
  href="../UART">UART Page</a>.  Our focus here is on the interactions
  between the DC, PIC, and CPU, and most of these interactions are
  strictly hardware functions.</p>
  
  <p>Intel processors have one pin that can be used initiate interrupt
  processing, which is called IRQ (Interrupt ReQuest).  The job of the
  PIC is to assert IRQ on behalf of multiple DCs.  Since the purpose of
  interrupt processing is to allow the CPU to "do other work" while
  waiting for an I/O transfer to take place, it's entirely possible for
  several DCs to be operating concurrently, giving rise to simultaneous
  requests for interrupt processing.  The PIC has the job of managing
  the requests from multiple DCs.  Each DC has a separate interrupt
  request line going to the PIC, as shown in Figure 1.</p>

    PIC and between the CPU and the DCs takes place over the System
    Bus." /></td></tr>

  <p>Figure 1 shows eight DCs connected to a standard Intel PIC.  If
  more than eight interrupt lines are needed, additional PICs can
  connected to the inputs of the PIC shown in the figure.  A standard
  PC has two PICs, with one "slave PIC" connected to input number 2 of
  the "master PIC," for a total of 15 available interrupt lines.</p>

  <p>A PIC is "programmable" in the following sense: when the computer
  first starts running, an initialization program writes command codes
  to the PIC(s) to tell it (them) how to handle interrupt requests
  arriving at each of its (their) inputs.  (To keep it simple, we'll
  just talk as if there is only one PIC from now on.)  In particular,
  the PIC is given an 8-bit number to associate with each input line,
  called that line's <i>interrupt level</i>.  In addition, each PIC is
  told how to handle simultaneous interrupt requests on its various
  inputs.  Options here include assigning a priority ordering among the
  lines, or having the PIC rotate priorities among the lines for
  successive requests.  The PIC has to be initialized before any
  interrupt-driven I/O takes place, so the initialization program
  resides in some non-volatile memory and which is executed
  automatically when power is applied to the system.  This program is
  called the "Basic I/O System" and is typically stored in flash
  memory.  Once an operating system has been loaded, it may well
  re-program the PIC(s) to change the priorities and interrupt levels
  of the input lines.</p>

  <p>Once the PIC has been initialized, it's ready to handle interrupt
  requests from the DCs connected to it.  When a DC completes an I/O
  transfer, it asserts its interrupt request line to the PIC.  (Assert
  means to make the voltage "true".)  In response, the PIC asserts the
  IRQ line to the CPU.  Some time later, and we'll discuss what happens
  during that time interval below, the CPU asserts the ACK line going
  back to the PIC.  In response, the PIC de-asserts IRQ, examines all
  of its inputs to see how many are true (additional lines may have
  gone true while waiting for the CPU to respond, for example), and
  sends the interrupt level number for the highest priority interrupt
  request at that moment back to the CPU over the system bus.  The CPU
  then processes the interrupt by exchanging information with the DC
  associated with the interrupt request, which causes the DC to
  de-assert its signal line to the PIC.  Finally, the CPU writes a
  special code byte called EOI (End of Interrupt) to the PIC over the
  system bus telling it that the interrupt has been processed.  At
  this point, the PIC examines its input lines and, if any of them are
  asserted, it asserts the IRQ line to the CPU again.</p>

<h2>CPU Interrupt Processing</h2>

  <p>Now let's look at the same process from the CPU's perspective. 
  We're trying to understand the hardware mechanisms involved, but we
  really can't avoid referring to the software the CPU executes because
  it is software that drives much of what the CPU hardware does.  But
  much of what follows describes what the CPU does without fetching and
  executing any instructions at all.  It's just a description of what
  functions logic circuits in the CPU do, and separate from the
  operations the CPU performs in fetching and executing instructions. 
  The exceptions below will be when we talk about "the operating system,"
  a "device driver," or "an interrupt service routine."  All of those
  phrases refer to software that the CPU executes using its normal
  fetch-execute cycle.</p>
  
  <p>First, when the CPU's IRQ input is asserted by the PIC, the CPU has
  to reach a proper state before acknowledging it.  In particular, the
  following conditions must be true:</p>
  
    <ul>

      <li><p><b>Interrupts must be enabled.</b>  There is an "interrupt
      enable" (ie) bit in the CPU's flags register (this register was
      called the <i>psr</i> in the ARC).  There are ISA-level
      instructions that can turn this bit on or off directly.  Also,
      the CPU saves and restores the flags register as part of its
      context switch mechanism, which can cause the ie bit to change
      state.  In any event, the CPU ignores the state of the IRQ line
      whenever the ie bit is false.</p></li>

      <li><p><b>The CPU must be between instructions.</b>  The idea of
      an interrupt is for the CPU to interrupt its execution of
      whatever program is running, to execute the appropriate code to
      handle the interrupt, and then to resume the execution of the
      interrupted program, or possibly of some other program that was
      waiting for the data transfer to complete.  The mechanism for
      interrupting and later resuming a program involves saving the
      state of the CPU's registers in memory, from which that state
      information can later be reloaded back into the CPU's registers
      when it is time to resume the program.  Among those CPU registers
      being saved is the program counter (PC).  When the program's
      state is reloaded into the CPU, the PC supplies the address of
      the next instruction to be executed, and the CPU starts its
      fetch-execute cycle at this address in the usual way.  The point
      here is that with very few exceptions, there is no mechanism for
      interrupting a program any place in the middle of the
      fetch-execute cycle for an instruction and then to continue
      processing of that instruction when the program is resumed. 
      Instead, the CPU waits until it has finished executing the
      instruction it is working on and the PC points to the next
      instruction to be executed before responding to an IRQ.</p>

      <p>An exception to this requirement is a small number of
      "interruptable" instructions that take a long time to execute,
      but which can be stopped and resumed because the state needed to
      do so is kept in one of the registers that is saved in memory. 
      For the Intel architecture, this includes some move instructions,
      which keep a count of how many bytes remain to be moved in one of
      the registers.</p> </li>

    </ul>


  <p>When the CPU is in an interruptable state and the IRQ line is
  asserted, the CPU asserts the ACK line to let the PIC know that it is
  ready to read the interrupt level number from the system bus.  The
  CPU uses the interrupt level as an index into a table of function
  addresses called the <i>interrupt vector</i>.  The functions pointed
  to by the entries in the interrupt vector are called interrupt
  service routines (ISRs) or interrupt handlers.  These functions are
  part of the device driver software that must be available for each
  device controller attached to the system.  When the device drivers
  are loaded into memory, either when the operating system is loaded at
  system startup or later as "loadable modules," the operating system
  fills in the interrupt vector with the appropriate addresses.  The
  Intel architecture allows the interrupt vector to start at any
  address in memory, and has a register in the CPU that the operating
  system loads with the address it uses so the interrupt hardware can
  find it.  Earlier Intel processors started the interrupt vector at
  memory location 0.</p>
  
  <p>Once it has the address of the ISR, the CPU goes through a sequence
  of steps much like those it takes when executing a call instruction:
  it pushes the program counter onto the stack (the address of the next
  instruction to execute in the interrupted program), it loads the
  address of the ISR into the PC, and proceeds to fetch the next
  instruction, the first instruction of the ISR.  In Intel processors,
  the CPU also pushes the flags register onto the stack and resets the
  ie bit before executing code from the ISR.  It is the job of the ISR
  to save whatever registers it will modify during its execution, and to
  read/write whatever DC registers are appropriate.  When the ISR is
  finished processing the interrupt, it writes the EOI code to the PIC,
  loads whatever register values it saved back into the CPU's registers,
  and executes an "interrupt return" instruction that pops the flags
  register and PC off the stack and into their CPU registers.  Popping
  the flag register has the effect of turning the ie bit back on so the
  next interrupt request from the PIC can be recognized.</p>
  
  <p>You probably noticed that interrupts are disabled while an ISR is
  executing.  Some processors allow a higher priority interrupt request
  to interrupt a lower priority ISR.  But disabling interrupts during
  ISR execution is the norm, and it is important to make this time
  interval as brief as possible.  For this reason, the ISR typically
  does a minimal amount of work interacting with the DC, and then
  signals the operating system to schedule another part of the device
  driver to do whatever additional processing is necessary, but with
  interrupts enabled again.</p>
