<H2>Common Lisp</H2>

For your LISP exercise, you need to use the Common LISP interpreter,
clisp, available for free download via anonymous ftp from ftp2.cons.org
in the directory /pub/lisp/clisp/.  It is available for a number of
Unix platforms including Linux and Tru64 (which runs on forbin.qc.edu),
as well as on PCs running Windows (any version).

<H3>Forbin Version</H3>

Clisp has already been installed on forbin; just type <I>clisp</I> at
the Unix prompt when logged into your account to start it up.  When you
enter the clisp command, it actually runs a small script that loads an
initial set of standard functions into the interpreter's memory for
you.  If you want to use any command line arguments, you need to
customize this.  For example, I like to start it with the "-q" option,
which eliminates a lot of extraneous text that normally fills up the
screen when you start it.  To do so, I put an executable text file in
my ~/bin dirctory on forbin, which says:<p>

<pre>
#!/usr/local/bin/ksh
exec /usr/local/lib/lisp/lisp.run -q -M /usr/local/lib/lisp/lispinit.mem "$@"
</pre>

See me if you are interested in this and can't figure out how to do it
from the above directions.

<H3>Windows Version</H3> If you prefer to run clisp on your PC, you can
do so, but you have to download and install it yourself.  You can
download a copy of the July, 1999 version for Windows here:

<UL>
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="clisp-win32.zip">clisp-win32.zip</A>&nbsp;]
</UL>

Since this is a binary file, how to download this file depends on what
browser you are using, and the version number of your browser.  Try
right clicking on the link and selecting "save as" from the menu that
pops up.  Or try clicking while holding the shift key.  You should end
up with a file size of 1,355,246 bytes on your PC's hard drive.<p>

To install clisp, you have to unzip the file you downloaded into some
directory on your hard drive.  The following instructions assume you are
using WinZip (which you have to download from www.winzip.com if you
don't already have it) to do the unzipping.  Be sure when you click
"Extract" that the checkbox to "use file folders" is clicked.  If you
extract the files to C:\Program Files (the standard place) you will
create a subdirectory named C:\Program Files\clisp-1999-07-22\, which
will contain a few subdirectories (with documentation, etc.) and an
executable file named clisp.exe in C:\Program Files\clisp-1999-07-22\.
There will also be a "memory image file" named C:\Program
Files\clisp-1999-07-22\lispinit.mem.  To run the program you have to
start a DOS Command window and type the following command:

<pre>
C:\Program&nbsp;Files\clisp-1999-07-22\clisp&nbsp;-q&nbsp;-M&nbsp;C:\Program&nbsp;Files\clisp-1999-07-22\lispinit.mem
</pre>

It's conceivable that you might not like typing all this each time you
want to run clisp.  You can set up a shortcut to do this for you, or you
can use a batch file to accomplish the same thing.  For now, we'll
assume you like typing very long command lines or know how to deal with
the shortcut or batch file issue on your own.

<H3>Both Versions</H3>

If you run either version of clisp, you will see the eval-loop prompt,
which on forbin is just a &gt; sign, but on Windows it will be a line
number in square brackets followed by a &gt; sign.  Type in
<CODE>(exit)</CODE> or <CODE>(quit)</CODE> to get back to the forbin or
DOS command prompt.<p>

From here you should be able to start working your way through the
Wilensky book!
