<H2>Additional Resources</H2>

<H3>The PFE Editor</H3>

  You may use any text editor you wish for preparing the programming
  projects in this course.  However, your code must be properly
  indented, and there must be no ASCII <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE>
  characters in your code.  These two requirements can most easily be
  met by using a good programmer's text editor.  There are many of them
  available, and you may get a completely free copy of PFE
  (Programmer's File Editor) from the  [&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Development_Tools.html">Development
  Tools</A>&nbsp;] page <U><I>for CS-101</I></U>.  You'll find
  instructions for installing it there too.

<H3>Java Development Kit</H3>

  You will be doing programming assignments using the Java language
  this term.  The Java Development Kit (JDK), version 1.2.2 (also
  called SDK&nbsp;2) is current and is available in the computer labs
  on campus.  You may download a free copy of JDK&nbsp;1.2.2 from the

  Tools</A>&nbsp;] page for CS-101.  You'll find instructions for
  installing it there too.

<H3>Common Lisp Interpreter/Compiler</H3>

  You will be doing programming projects using the Common LISP language
  this term, and will need a compiler/interpreter for that language. 
  You can use the <CODE>clisp</CODE> command from your forbin account. 
  Or you can install the same software on any PC that is available to
  you.  You can get the program  from the  [&nbsp;<a
