; TailCount.lsp

; Example of a function that uses tail recursion.
;   The last form evaluated is a recursive call.
;   The return value of the function is never used

(defun tailcount ( x )
  (cond ((= x 0) nil)
        (t (print x) (tailcount (- x 1)))))

; BUT, I get a stack overflow when I run this
; with any value greater than 2927 for x,
; which indicates that clisp doesn't do any
; optimization for tail recursion.
