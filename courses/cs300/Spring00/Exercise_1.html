<H2>Introduction</H2>

This exercise is designed to give you some experience parsing text into
lexemes using Java's StreamTokenizer class.  We have to be careful about
terminology because StreamTokenizer is really a "lexemizer" rather than
a "tokenizer" according to the text's use of those terms.  The idea is
to identify and print each lexeme in a source file.<p>

I have chosen to have your program analyze Java programs, but once you
have completed this assignment, you should be able to use the
StreamTokenizer class to analyze source code for any programmng
language.

<H2>Assignment</H2>

Write a Java application which does the following for each file
specified on the java command line:

<UL>

    <LI>If the file name does not end with ".java" print an error
    message and ignore the file.

    <LI>Use the file name to construct a BufferedReader, and use the
    BufferedReader to construct a StreamTokenizer.  If either of these
    operations fails, print an error message, and ignore the file.

    <LI>Modify the StreamTokenizer so that it will recognize the lexemes
    of the Java language.<p>
    
    The steps to do this include:
    
    <UL>
        <LI>Make '/' an ordinary character, and make the StreamTokenizer
        recognize both C and C++ style comments.
        
        <LI>Make '.' an ordinary character, and make the digits and
        underscore characters word characters.
        
        <LI>Make end of line significant to the StreamTokenizer.  This
        has more to do with formatting the output of your program than
        with the syntax of the Java language, which does not attach any
        significance to line boundaries except when recognizing string
        literals.

    </UL>

    <LI>For each statement in the source file, print the Statement
    number and the line number on which it occurs, followed by each
    lexeme that makes up the statement.  We will use the heuristic of
    saying that each semicolon ends a statement.  (How accurate is
    this?)  For this assignment you are to separate the lexemes by
    single spaces.  An optional extension to this project is to print
    the token type for each lexeme; in this case, you should print each
    lexeme on a separate line.

</UL>

<H2>Sample Output</H2>

If your working directory contains a file named Sample.java and your
application's main class is called PrintLexemes, the following could
represent an interaction you could have with your program:

<pre>
<B>cs300></B><I> java PrintLexemes junk.java Sample.java tower.lsp</I>

Unable to read junk.java

File: Sample.java
  Statement 1 (line 2)
     import java . io . * ;
  Statement 2 (line 4)
     public class Sample
     {
     public static void main ( String [ ] argv )
     {
     int count , nextToken ;
  Statement 3 (line 28)
     for ( int i = 0.0 ;
  Statement 4 (line 29)
     i &lt; argv . length ;
  Statement 5 (line 29)
     i + + )
     {
     try
     {
     FileReader fr = new FileReader ( argv [ i ] ) ;
  Statement 6 (line 34)
     BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader ( fr ) ;
  Statement 7 (line 35)
     StreamTokenizer st = new StreamTokenizer ( br ) ;
  Statement 8 (line 36)
     count = 0.0 ;
  Statement 9 (line 37)
     nextToken = StreamTokenizer . TT_WORD ;
  Statement 10 (line 38)
     while ( StreamTokenizer . TT_EOF ! =
     ( nextToken = st . nextToken ( ) ) )
     {
     count + + ;
  Statement 11 (line 42)
     }
     System . out . println ( argv [ i ] + " has " + count +
     " lexemes." ) ;
  Statement 12 (line 45)
     }
     catch ( IOException ioe )
     {
     System . err . println ( ioe . getMessage ( ) ) ;
  Statement 13 (line 49)
     }
     }
     }
     }

tower.lsp is not a .java file.

Here is the program Sample.java that was used as input to the program
to generate the output above.  It doesn't do what your program is
supposed to do, but I used it for sample input because it should help
you get started on your own Java application.

<H2>Developing and Submitting the Assignment</H2>

You may work on this assignment either individually or in groups of up
to three people.  You are free to draw on any resources you wish to do
this assignment, including friends, relatives, and strangers.  Most
importantly, feel free to ask me for help if you need it, either in
class (if you think your questions are possibly of general interest) or
by email (typically for debugging questions).  You will not actually
receive any credit for doing the assignment, but you will be tested on
the concepts involved in doing it on your first exam in the course.<p>

Submit the assignment to me using the following procedure:

<UL>

    <LI>Create a zip file that contains your .java file (not your .class
    file(s)).  You can do this using WinZip or the <I>jar</I> command
    that comes with the JDK.  For example, you can type:

    <pre>
        jar cvf Exercise_1.zip PrintLexemes.java</pre>

    This will create a zip file named <CODE>Exercise_1.zip</CODE> that
    contains a file named <CODE>PrintLexemes.java</CODE>.<p>

    <LI>Attach the zip file to an email message and send it to me
    (vickery@forbin.qc.edu).

</UL>

If you work in a group, submit just one copy of the program to me, but
be sure to put an @author tag for each memeber of the group in the
comments at the beginning of the program.  (Put each @author tag on a
separate line containing just an optional asterisk followed by the
@author tag and your name.  Do <U>not</U> include your ID number or
anything else on the same line as the @author tag.  Instead, put your
ID number on the line <I>below</I> the @author tag, as shown in
Sample.java.<p>

If you really want to do this project in C or C++ instead of Java (some
transfer students are more comfortable with those languages than with
Java), you may do so provided you use only standard library functions
(plus any you write yourself).  The program must run from either a Unix
or DOS command line; it must not be dependent on any Integrated
Development Environment or Windows for me to be able to compile and
test it.  I will use GNU development tools to compile your C/C++ code;
check with me if you don't know how to do that yourself on forbin.<p>
