I've just put up a web page that goes over how to set up a JavaScript
application "properly." There is a link to it on the course schedule page,
or you can try this copy of the link:
http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/courses/cs090.3/setting_up_js_apps.xhtml

It's a required reading assignment, but because it's also the first version of
the page I'd appreciate any feedback about understanding it and/or errors you
find in it.
