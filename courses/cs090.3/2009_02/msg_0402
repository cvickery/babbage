  I put my solution for Assignment 4 up on the course web site; there is a link
  to it on the course schedule.

  As I said in class today, this is not "how you should have done it" but rather
  a demonstration of some JavaScript idioms that use concepts that we have
  already covered, but in a more advanced fashion than the normal JavaScript
  beginner is likely to use. The comments in the code are more detailed than
  usually needed; hope they help. Feel free to bring questions to class.
