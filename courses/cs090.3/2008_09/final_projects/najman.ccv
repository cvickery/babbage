  Able to log in as an existing user and to be rejected as a
  user not in database; bad password gives a "PASS" message
  on the screen.

  But that's it.

  Lots of commented out code; virtually no meaningful
  comments (any?).

  Code correctly implements the structure I outlined by
  email.

  Does not check for duplicate email addresses.
