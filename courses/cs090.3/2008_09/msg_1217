  I just got a message from Dr. Brown at the Graduate
  Center; he's looking for a PHP student programmer for "a
  project with environment center at queens" -- I've got no
  details on pay or time requirements at this point, but if
  you are interested, let me know and I'll find out more
  about it.

  Dr. Vickery
