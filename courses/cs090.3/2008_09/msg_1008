  I have set up a database for each of you on maple. The
  name of your database is the same as your login account
  name.

  I wanted to make your databases available to you from off
  campus, but that would require the college to reconfigure
  its firewall to allow outside connections to port 5432 on
  maple, which I think is too much to ask of them. If you
  really cannot work on your projects without off-campus
  access to the database, let me know.

  But you should be able to access your database from any
  computer on campus (one that has an IP address in the
  form 149.4.xxx.xxx).

  I'd appreciate it if one of you would verify that you can
  connect to your database using pgAdmin as soon as possible
  and let me know if whether you are successful browsing it
  or not.

  A student mentioned using phpPgAdmin to access your
  database using a browser instead of the pgAdmin program
  that is already installed in the lab. I'll write up
  instructions on how to use it after I hear (a) that
  someone accesses his database successfully and (b) that
  anyone is interested in phpPgAdmin. (The user interface
  might be simpler ...)
