  I posted grades for the exam and the course. When you
  check online, you will see a numeric course grade listed
  with one decimal place, but that degree of precision is
  misleading. I gave letter grades for Assignment 5 and
  made it count twice as much as the other assignments. In
  grading the final, I ranked the answers for each question
  (1 was the best answer, 4 the poorest), but then I allowed
  people to have tie scores on some of the questions. The
  obvious was to compute the exam score, naturally, was to
  multiply the total of your ranks by negative 2.0 and to
  add 120.5. (The reasons for using -2.0 and +120.5 are so
  "obvious" that I won't bother to explain where those
  numbers came from.)

  I ended up making the first four assignments count 25%,
  the last assignment 25%, and the exam 50%. Despite the
  high weight for the exam, it turned out that what you got
  for the final project was pretty much what you got for the
  course ... it just worked out that way.

  I'll post the grades to the registrar next week after I've
  had a chance to go over everything again.

  Best wishes to everyone for a Happy New Year!
