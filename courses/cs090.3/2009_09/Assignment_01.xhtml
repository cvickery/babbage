    <h1>CS-90.3 Assignment 1</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div>
      For this assignment, you are to set up your course web site in the course laboratory and verify that you can run
      JavaScript code
      successfully
    </div>
    <h2>The Assignment</h2>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h5>Log into your account and verify the roaming profile feature is working.</h5>
          <p class="run-in">
            Refer to the <a href="../../TREE_Lab/index.xhtml">TREE Lab Information</a> web page for information on
            logging into your account in the lab.  Be sure to change your password to something secure: Press
            Ctrl-Alt-Delete after your are logged in, and click on the &ldquo;Change Password&rdquo; button.
          </p>
          <p>
            Download the <a href="../template.zip">template file</a> for the course to your desktop, and extract its
            contents (a single file named <span class="filename">template.xhtml</span>) to the <span
            class="directory-name">My Website</span> directory under your <span class="directory-name">My
            Documents</span> directory. Log off, which should cause your &ldquo;roaming profile&rdquo; to be copied to
            the server computer (<span class="computer-name">oak</span>). Now log into a different computer, and verify
            that the zip file appears on your desktop there and that <span class="filename">template.xhtml</span> is in
            your <span class="directory-name">My Website</span> directory, implying that the work you did on the first
            computer was successfully transferred to the server when you logged off, and then was transferred from the
            server to the second computer when you logged into it.
          </p>
          <p class="standout-box">
            If you have any problem with this procedure, let me know right away so it can be fixed. Do not do any of the
            next steps until this one is working correctly.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Set up a Dreamweaver site for your course assignments.</h5>
          <p class="run-in">
            The <a href="../../cs081/using_dreamweaver.xhtml">Dreamweaver Setup</a> web page tells how to set up a
            Dreamweaver site for the course, and it was demonstrated in class on September 10th. Set up your site, and
            then use Dreamweaver to open the template file for editing. Remove all the comments from the file, and close
            it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Duplicate the template file and change the name of the copy from &ldquo;Copy of template.xhtml&rdquo; to
            &ldquo;index.xhtml&rdquo;. Open <span class="filename">index.xhtml</span> in the Dreamweaver code editor,
            and change the content of the <span class="tag-name">title</span> element to something meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Edit the contents of the <span class="tag-name">h1</span> element to be something meaningful. It can be the
            same as the contents of the <span class="tag-name">title</span> element. View your web page using a
            &ldquo;tilde-notation&rdquo; URL: <span
            class="code-snippet">http://<em>sometree</em>.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~<em>youraccountname</em></span>. Substitute
            the name of the computer you are working on for &ldquo;sometree&rdquo;, and substitute your lab account name
            for <em>youaccountname</em>.
          </p>
          <p class="standout-block">
            If you put an apostrophe in the text of the <span class="tagName">h1</span>, be sure to make it
            typographically correct. If you just type the &ldquo;apostrophe&rdquo; character on the right side of your
            keyboard, you will get a straight &ldquo;prime&rdquo; character ( ' ), not an apostrophe ( &rsquo; ).
            Instead, type <strong>&amp;rsquo;</strong>, which will  give you a  &ldquo;right single quote&rdquo; symbol,
            which will be curved the way an apostrophe should be curved. Throughout the semester, make sure all
            quotation marks in textual content are typographically correct. (<strong>&amp;ldquo;</strong> = left double
            quote; <strong>&amp;rdquo;</strong> = right double quote; <strong>&amp;lsquo;</strong> = left single quote.)
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Add a simple JavaScript program to your site</h5>
          <p class="run-in">
            Put a <span class="tagName">script</span> element in the head of your index page, with the <span
            class="attributeName">src</span> attribute pointing to <span class="filename">scripts/sample.js</span>.
            Actually, this element should already be there because it is part of the <span
            class="filename">template.xhtml</span> file for this course.
          </p>
          <p>
            Use Dreamweaver to create a directory named <span class="directory-name">scripts</span> under your <span
            class="directory-name">My Website</span> directory, as demonstrated in class. Then use Dreamweaver to create
            a new code file in that directory: rename it from <span class="filename">untitled.xhtml</span> to <span
            class="filename">sample.js</span>. Add the following line to the file:
          </p>
          <p class="code-block">
  alert("Your message goes here");
          </p>
          <p>
            You can make the message anything you want, and you can use single quotes instead of double quotes if you
            prefer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now reload your web page and verify that the <span class="functionName">alert</span> dialog-box shows up
            before the rest of the page is rendered. Note that simply reloading the page will not let you see this
            timing if the reloaded page looks exactly like the newly-loaded page. Figure out a way to observe this
            effect.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h5>Validate your site.</h5>
          <p class="run-in">
            Make sure the green "OK" icon <img src="images/ok.png" alt="" /> shows in the lower right corner of the
            browswer window when you are viewing your page. Then click on the XHTML link at the bottom of the page to be
            sure you get the corresponding verification from the W3C online validator. If either check fails, you have
            to figure out what is wrong with your code and fix it before submitting the assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that there is no style sheet for the web page yet, so there is no need to validate any CSS.
          </p>
        </li>

      </ol>
    </div>
    <h2>Submit The Assignment</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        When you have tested your web site and verified that everything validates and runs correctly, log out so your
        site will be copied back to the server. Then send me an email to let me know your assignment is ready for
        grading: I will copy your site from the lab server to babbage to verify that it is correct.
