  I've updated the course schedule page to show there will
  be no exam next Tuesday and that the final project will
  be due on Saturday the 22nd.

  I've updated the final project assignment page
  (discovering that I never posted the earlier version in
  the process). The page is still not complete, but I've
  gotten the kinks out of it, with JavaScript and PHP
  exchanging JSON-encoded objects just fine. I'll send
  another email when I update the assignment page again.

  Here's the deal: I will accept Assignments 1-4 if they are
  submitted by this Saturday, but no later than that.  And
  the deadline for the final project is strict: no
  extensions. You have to submit what you've got finished by
  midnight of the 22nd, so make sure you always keep copies
  of what works as you go from step to step.
