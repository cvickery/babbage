  I've been updating the final assignment web page. To make
  it easier to track changes, the course schedule now tells
  you the last time the assignment page was updated. (But
  you might need to refresh the page to see the update.)

  Completion of the first five steps will be required in
  order to receive full credit for Assignment 8. But you
  will be able to get extra credit for going beyond that.
  So far I have written up only Step 6a (the first one
  beyond the required five). If you want to work on 6b
  before I post more information on the assignment page, let
  me know!

  Don't forget, our final exam will be Tuesday from 4:00 to
  6:00 pm in our regular classroom.
