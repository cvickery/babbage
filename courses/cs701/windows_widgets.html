<H2>Mapping, Managing, and Realizing Widgets</H2>

<H3><A NAME="Windows">Windows</A></H3>

<P>
This document defines some of the terms associated with widgets
and windows under the X Window System. Taking a bottom-up approach,
we begin by defining a <I>window</I> as a rectangular region of
pixels. There are many important attributes of windows, such as
their geometry and capabilities for displaying different colors,
but this document deals with just those attributes that have to
do with what I will call &quot;housekeeping&quot; aspects of windows.
Windows are created by a server in response to client requests.
The window exists as a data structure created by the server in
the memory of the server's workstation. Each window has a unique
identifier that the server returns to the client when the window
is created. The client passes this identifier back to the server
in subsequent requests that need to reference the window.
<P>
Windows on a screen have a rooted-tree relationship to each other.
A distinguished window, the <I>root window</I> is created automatically
by the server when it starts up. The root window covers the entire
screen of the display. Every window is a child of another window,
and if a window is a direct child of the root window, it has the
special properties that we will see below in the section on <A HREF="#ManagingWindows">Managing Windows</A>.
All windows are constrained to exist within the boundaries of
its parent. When you see a pop-up dialog box that appears (or
can be moved) outside the boundaries of an application, you know
that the window that contains the dialog box is actually a child
of the root window, not of the application's top-level window.

<H4><A NAME="MappingWindows">Mapping Windows</A></H4>

<P>
Creating a window does not make anything appear on the screen.
To do that, the window must be <I>mapped,</I> which happens when
a client makes a mapping request to the server. There are two
reasons for separating window creation from window mapping:.
<OL>
<LI>Applications start up &quot;cleaner.&quot; Typically, there
are many adjustments that have to be made to windows between the
time they are created and the time they are ready for viewing
by the user. For example, one window might act as a container
for several other windows (a menu that contains a number of buttons,
perhaps). Rather than display first the empty parent window, then
the parent with one child, then the parent with two children,
etc. it is better to create the parent and all the children, and
then map them all at once so the user sees just one coherent image
rather than all the intermediate steps leading to its construction.
<LI>A window can be made to appear, disappear, and reappear by
mapping, unmapping, and remapping it, so the server does not have
to discard and reconstruct the window each time the client wants
it to disappear and reappear. Also, a single request from a client
to a server is enough to cause a window and all its descendants
to be mapped. Thus mapping and unmapping are efficient, both in
terms of computational load and network overhead
</OL>

<P>
Widget programmers (programmers who use widgets to write applications)
do not typically map an unmap windows; that is handled by the
Intrinsics as described in the section on <A HREF="#RealizingWidgets">realizing widgets</A>.
That is, mapping is an X Protocol or Xlib concept, not a toolkit
concept.

<H4><A NAME="ManagingWindows">Managing Windows</A></H4>

<P>
Although it is not necessary, most users run a special client
program called a <I>window manager</I> when they are using X.
Among other things, the window manager provides the &quot;decorations&quot;
that surround top-level windows like resize bars, minimize, maximize,
and dismiss buttons, etc. Without a window manager, users would
have no way to move and resize applications on the screen, to
cut and paste between applications, or to iconify applications.
The user could change the geometry of subwindows within an application
if the application is programmed to support that, but there would
be no way to change the geometry of windows that are direct children
of the root window. The X protocol defines certain requests and
replies that a window manager may exchange with the server that
normal clients do not use. For example, a window manager may request
the server to notify it if any client creates a window that is
a child of the root window, and the window manager can then make
a &quot;reparent&quot; request to make such a window a child of
a window belonging to the window manager rather than a child of
the root.
<P>
The server provides a mechanism called <I>properties</I> which
clients can use for communicating with each other. Properties
are name-value pairs that a client can attach to a window, typically
its own top-level window. Any client can find out the value of
any named property on a window provided only that it knows that
window's id (token). Since a window manager has the tokens for
all the windows that it manages, properties are used for communication
between normal clients and a window manager. Just to give and
example, a client might add a property to its top-level window
with the name equal to &quot;<CODE>WM_TITLE</CODE>&quot; and a
value equal to the string the client would like the window manager
to display in the title bar for the application. (For network
efficiency, there is an integer called an <I>atom</I> that is
used to identify property names so that arbitrarily long strings
of bytes won't have to be sent over the network every time a client
wants to reference a particular property.) It's easy for clients
to access the root window of a screen, so there is a lot of general-purpose
information that is stored as properties on that window. You can
type &quot;xprop -root&quot; to see for yourself.

<H3><A NAME="Widgets">Widgets</A></H3>

<P>
Widgets are objects that can be used to construct a graphical
user interface.  Examples can be as simple as a button that the
user can point to and click on and as complex as a window the
user can use for entering and editing text.
<P>
Whereas the implementation of a window is an object that is created
and manipulated by an X server, the implementation of a widget
is an object that is created and manipulated by an X client. We
sometimes say that a client creates a window, but if we want to
speak pedantically, we should say that a client requests the server
to create a window for it. There is a data structure that holds
all the information about a widget, but a widget's data structure
is part of the client process' address space, not the server's.
A widget's data structure contains a copy of the identifier for
the widget's window, so there is a window associated with each
widget. But a widget's data structure contains other information
as well, including pointers to the code that is to be executed
when the widget is created or when the user interacts with it,
and name-value pairs of <I>resources</I> that specify the parameters
that affect the widget's appearance and operation. There is <U>no</U>
relationship between a widget's resources and a window's properties,
even though both are sets of name-value pairs.
<H4><A NAME="ManagedWidgets">Managed Widgets</A></H4>

<P>
Just as there is a tree structure relating windows on a screen,
there is also a tree structure relating the widgets in an application.
The root of an application's widget tree is called a <I>top-level</I>
or <I>shell</I> widget, and an application is allowed to create
more than one of these top-level widgets if it wants to. The window
associated with each top-level widget is created as a child of
the server's root window, which makes these top-level widgets
subject to management by the user's window manager.
<P>
A &quot;managed widget&quot; is different from a &quot;managed
window,&quot; although there is an analogy between the two. Whereas
a top-level window would be managed by a window manager client,
a managed widget is one which is managed by its parent widget
within the application. A managed widget's window size and position
on the screen is computed (managed) by its parent widget. It is
possible to create unmanaged widgets, but their windows will not
be allocated screen space within their parent and will not be
visible on the screen. A client could make an unmanaged widget
appear by making Xlib calls to map its window, but the Intrinsics
provide another mechanism for mapping and unmapping a widget's
window, which will be described below. It is possible to manage
and unmanage a widget dynamically as an application runs, but
there is considerable behind-the-scenes overhead for this because
the managing parent has to recompute the geometry of all its children
whenever one of them is unmanaged or managed again.

<H4><A NAME="RealizingWidgets">Realizing Widgets</A></H4>

<P>
Just as creating and mapping are separate operations for windows,
creating and <I>realizing</I> are separate operations for widgets.
No window is created for a widget until it is realized, but when
a window is realized, all its managed children are also recursively
realized automatically. The window that is created when a widget
is realized is normally mapped at the same time, although this
can be overridden by setting the value of one of the widget's
resources, <CODE>XtNmappedWhenManaged</CODE>, to False. Once all
the child widgets of a container widget have been created, the
container widget can compute how large each child's window should
be and where it should be placed so each managed widget's window
is created with its proper geometry with no need for extra requests
to the server to change the geometry of the managed widgets' windows
as the application starts up.
<P>
Because of the <CODE>XtNmappedWhenManaged</CODE> resource, a realized
widget can be in any of three states:
<DL>
<DT><I>Mapped and Managed</I> 
<DD>The widget is allocated screen space by its parent and is
visible on the screen within the parent's boundaries.
<DT><I>Unmapped but Managed</I> 
<DD>The widget is allocated screen space by its parent but it
does not appear on the screen. The space for the widget is filled
in with the parent's background color.
<DT><I>Unmanaged</I> 
<DD>No space is allocated for the widget, and the parent's geometry
layout routine places the other widgets under its management wherever
it wishes without regard for the unmanaged widget.
