<H1 align=center>HTTP Requests</H1>

This material comes from a draft copy of  "Hypertext Transfer Protocol"
dated 5 Nov 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee of CERN.<p>

I have put a few notes of my own in here.  They are indicated by my
initials in brackets: [ccv]<p>
<blockquote>
	"These header lines are sent by the client in a HTTP proptocol
	transaction. ... The list of headers is terminated by an empty
	line.<p>

	"From:  ... this gives the name of the requesting user.  This
	field may be used for logging purposes ...<p>

	"Accept: This field contains a comma-separated list of representation
	schemes (Content-Type metainformation values) which will be accepted
	in response to this request. ... The set given may ... vary from
	request to request from the same user. ... More than one occurrence
	of the field is allowed ... If no Accept: field is present, then it
	is assumed that text/plain and text/html are accepted.<p>
<pre>
[ccv]	The following BNF is slightly rewritten from what appears in the
[ccv]	standard.
[ccv]	[ xxx ]* means zero or more occurrences of xxx.
[ccv]	q is a "quality" indicator between 0 and 1.0 -- see example below.
[ccv]	mxs and mxb are maximum tolerable delay in seconds and maximum
[ccv]	tolerable response message size.
[ccv]	You don't have to worry about any of this for your project, but
[ccv]	since you will see Lynx generating Accept: fields, I thought your
[ccv]	might like to know what it is all about.
</pre>
<pre>
            &ltfield> :=    Accept: &ltentry> [ ; &ltentry ]*
            &ltentry> :=    &ltcontent_type> [, &ltparam> ]*
            &ltparam> :=    &ltattr> = &ltfloat>
            &ltattr>  :=    q | mxs | mxb
            &ltfloat> :=    &ltANSI C floating-point constant
	                    representation>
</pre>
	... an asterisk may be used in place of either the second half of
	the content-type value, or both halves. ...<p>
<pre>
	Example:

	    Accept: *.*, q=0.1
	    Accept: audio/*, q=0.2
	    Accept: audio/basic, q=1.0
</pre>
	may be interpreted as "if you have basic audio, send it; otherwise
	send me some other audio, or failing that, just give me what you've
	got.<p>

	"Accept-Encoding:  Similar to Accept: but lists the Content-Encoding
	types which are acceptable in the response.  [ccv: such as compressed
	or zipped]<p>

	"User-Agent:  This line, if present [ccv: your clients must include
	this line] gives the software program used by the ... client.  This
	is for statistical purposes and the tracing of protocol violations.
	... The first white space delimited word must be the software
	product name, with a ... slash and version designator.<p>

	"Referer:  This optional header field allows the client to specify,
	for the server's benefit, the address (URI) of the document from
	which the URI in the request was obtained.  This allows the server
	to generate lists of back-links to documents, for interest, logging,
	etc.  It allows bad links to be traced for maintenance. ...<p>

	"Authorization:  If this line is present it contains authorization
	information.  The format is To Be Specified (TBS). ...<p>

	"Charge To:  This line if present contains account information for
	the costs of the application of the method requested.  [ccv: a
	"method" is what we are calling a "protocol," like "http" or "file."]
	The format is TBS. ...<p>

	"Note: Server tolerance of bad clients.  Whilst it is seen
	appropriate for [student-written] parsers to check full
	conformance to this specification, it is recommended that
	operational parsers be tolerant of deviations.  In particular,
	lines should be regarded as terminated by the Line Feed, and
	the preceeding Carriage Return character ignored.  Any HTTP
	Header Field Name which is not recognized should be ignored
	...<p>
