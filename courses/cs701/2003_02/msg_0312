  > Sun Microsystems Will Give Its Software to Students and Faculty
  > Members Free By FLORENCE OLSEN
  > <<mailto:florence.olsen@chronicle.com>>  Sun Microsystems is
  > giving students and professors a free ride. The company announced
  > on Monday that it would no longer charge them for nearly 100
  > software products, including programming tools.  Excluded from the
  > program are colleges' administrative offices. They will continue
  > to pay the usual license fees.  Students and faculty members will
  > gain free access to many of Sun's Java programming tools, which
  > are used to write programs that run on the Web. The portfolio of
  > free products will include Solaris 9, which is Sun's proprietary
  > version of the Unix operating system; StarOffice, which includes a
  > word-processing program; and Sun One Studio, a suite of developer
  > tools for Sun's Java platform.  One analyst said the announcement
  > was not surprising, considering colleges' increasing reliance on
  > Linux software for teaching and their lessening interest in
  > Microsoft's and Sun's software.  "Education is incredibly
  > important for both companies, primarily because education has been
  > going heavily toward Linux, and Linux is free," said Rob Enderle,
  > an analyst at Giga Information Group, a market-research company.
  > The Linux operating system and programming tools are based on
  > open-source code, which its voluntary developers worldwide make
  > freely available for anyone to use and to modify.  "Both Microsoft
  > and Sun are trying to keep education from going to Linux, and from
  > developing more programmers and potential customers for that
  > platform," Mr. Enderle said.  Sun Microsystems officials
  > acknowledged that the company's free-licensing strategy is based
  > on the fact that student innovation has created a market for
  > products that have since been adopted by better-paying corporate
  > customers, an assessment with which Mr.  Enderle agreed.  "The
  > affinity that has been driving Linux into corporations has come
  > from the new hires -- the people brought in from colleges and
  > universities," he said, "very much like it was with Unix and with
  > Microsoft software in years past."  Sun officials said they hoped
  > the new program would get more students and faculty members using
  > Sun's Java platform, a set of Web programming tools that compete
  > in the marketplace with Microsoft's Visual Studio.net tools, which
  > are used to write applications for the Windows operating system
  > and for the Web.  Last week, Microsoft announced a $3.5-million
  > program of grants aimed at making its programmer tools available
  > to computer-science students.  Sun's no-cost licensing program,
  > which will affect education and research institutions worldwide,
  > was valued by Sun as "very, very conservatively $1-billion," said
  > Kim Jones, vice president for global education and research. The
  > program includes free Web-based software training and quarterly
  > software updates.  "Students who really want to become familiar
  > with what it takes to build out interesting projects -- for
  > everything from next-generation gaming on handsets to more
  > creative and innovative peer-to-peer applications -- now have
  > access ubiquitously and without charge to all of that technology,"
  > said Jonathan Schwartz, executive vice president for software.
  > Sun officials began the announcement with a joking reference to
  > students' unwillingness to pay for software. "We want to make them
  > feel a lot better about that," Mr. Schwartz said.  Colleges and
  > universities that are interested in the free licensing program
  > should contact Ms. Jones by e-mail at kim.jones@sun.com
  > <mailto:kim.jones@sun.com>, <<mailto:kim.jones@sun.com>> and they
  > will be given instructions on how to download the software.
