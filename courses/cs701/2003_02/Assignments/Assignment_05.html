<h1>JSH With PJVM</h1>
</center>

<h2 class="warning">This Page is Not Complete Yet</h2>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This is the final version of the <i>jsh</i> project for the
  semester.  You will be developing it in a sequence of steps, and this
  web page will be updated as new steps are introduced.  The assignment
  will be due on midnight of the last day of exams, May 23.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>The goal of the assignment is to allow a user of <i>jsh</i> to
  load Java class files into a "Persistent Java Virtual Machine" (PJVM)
  and to invoke methods within those classes by typing commands on the
  command line.  The name PJVM refers to the fact that the JVM gets
  created once when <i>jsh</i> starts running, and continues to run
  (persists) until <i>jsh</i> exits.  This is in contrast with a
  conventional JVM such as the one invoked by the <i>java</i> command,
  which is loaded and started for every Java program the user runs.</p>

  <p>When the user types in a command line, <i>jsh</i> will read and
  tokenize it in the usual way.  If it turns out that the command name
  is neither a shell builtin (alias, echo, exit), nor the name of an
  executable file, <i>jsh</i> is to write the command to a separate
  process, which will interpret the command line and load a class into
  a running jvm, and optionally invoke one of the class' methods.</p>

  <h3><a name="aliases">Implement Aliases</a></h3>

  <p>If you have not done so yet, implement the <i>alias</i> builtin
  command and alias substitution.  Use an STL <i>map</i> to implement
  the alias table.  An <i>alias</i> command with no arguments should
  cause all aliases and their values to be displayed.  The syntax for
  defining a new alias (or to replace an existing alias) can be either
  "alias&nbsp;name&nbsp;value" or "alias&nbsp;name=value" as you
  prefer.</p>

  <p><a href="#steps">Back to List of Steps</a></p>

  <h3><a name="version2">Bring All Project Files Up To Version
  2</a></h3>

  <p>Before starting on the remainder of the project, bring all project
  files up to RCS revision 2.1.  You do this by checking each file out
  with the lock option, and then checking them back in with the "-f"
  and "-r2" options.  The -r2 option (or -r2.1) checks the file in with
  the new version number.  Normally, you can't check in a file if you
  haven't modified it in any way, but the -f option <u>f</u>orces RCS
  to check the file in even though nothing changed.  An appropriate log
  message would be something like, "Starting work on Version 2."  Note
  that you can use a single <i>ci</i> command to check in all the files
  in the project.  If you do, you will need to enter the log message
  just once for all of them.</p>
  
  <p>If you add new files to the project after this, be sure to use the
  -r2 option the first time you check them in.</p>
  
  <p>When you have this working, you will be able to make either version
  of the project by making the environment variable (or </p>make<p>
  variable) COFLAGS equal to -r1 or -r2.  For example, in a clean
  project directory, you could type, "make COFLAGS=-r1" to build version
  1 of the project.  (Thought question: What is the difference between
  "make&nbsp;COFLAGS=-r1" and COFLAGS=r1&nbsp;make"?)</p>

  <p><a href="#steps">Back to List of Steps</a></p>

  <h3><a name="skeleton">Create a Skeleton of the JVM Process</a></h3>

  <p>For this step, have the main process fork a child
  process when it first starts up.  We'll call this new process the jvm
  process and the main process the jsh process from now on.  Before
  creating the jvm process, create a pipe for communicating between it
  and the jsh process.  The purpose of this step is to manage
  interprocess communciation (IPC) between the jsh and jvm processes.</p>
  
  <p>Your code is to implement the following IPC features:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The jsh process can write message strings to the jvm process at
    any time.
    <li>The jvm process can write message strings to the jsh process at
    any time.
    <li>The jsh process must notify the user if the jvm process
    terminates unexpectedly at any time.  The jsh process must create a
    replacement jvm process if this happens.
    <li>The jsh process must tell the jvm process to terminate when the
    jsh process itself terminates.
    <li>Messages from the jvm process are displayed to the user only
    when the jsh process is reading a command line from the user.  The
    prompt string and user command must not be garbled on the string
    when a message from the jvm process is displayed.  That is, the
    prompt string and whatever part of the commmand line the user has
    entered must be redisplayed after printing a message from the jvm
    process.
  </ul>

  <p>Here is an example of what I mean by the last item in the above
  list:</p>

  <pre>
    <i>jsh&gt;</i> <font class="darker">da</font>
    <font class="blue">JVM: This is a message from the jvm ...</font>
    <font class="red">jsh&gt;da</font><font class="darker">te</font>
    <i>(output of the date command)</i>
    <i>jsh&gt;</i>
  </pre>

  <p>In this example, the user was in the middle of typing a "date"
  command (green characters), when a message arrived from the jvm
  process and was displayed on the user's screen.  The red text is what
  the jsh printed on the screen before continuing to read the command
  the user was entering.</p>

  <p>To test this version of your program, code the jvm process so it 
  reads an initial message from the jsh process when it starts up, and
  sends this same message back to the jsh process at 5 second intervals
  for as long as it runs.  Either the jsh or jvm process should display
  the jvm process' pid so you can experiment with killing the jvm
  process with a kill command from a second console window to see if
  that is handled properly.</p>

  <p><a href="#steps">Back to List of Steps</a></p>

  <h3><a name="ipc">Send Command Lines to the JVM Process</a></h3>

  <p>If the user enters a command that is not a builtin command, the jsh
  process searches through the user's PATH, using the <i>access()</i>
  system call to determine whether an executable file can be found.  (If
  the command name starts with . or / don't search the PATH, just test
  the explicit pathname the user entered.)  If the command name fails
  the <i>access()</i> test, send the entire command as a message to the
  jvm process.  The jvm process waits 5 seconds, and sends back a
  message saying "JVM: <i>&lt;user's command&gt;</i>"</p>

  <p><a href="#steps">Back to List of Steps</a></p>

  <h3><a name="pjvm">Implement the PJVM</a></h3>

  <p>Well, you know, the user types in executable Java statements, and
  the jsh process sends them to the jvm process, which executes them in
  the jvm.  There are also commands for determining which classes are
  currently loaded into the jvm, for listing the methods available for
  each of those classes, and stuff like that.  And a command for seeing
  how much memory the jvm is using.  You know, like, other stuff too ...</p>
