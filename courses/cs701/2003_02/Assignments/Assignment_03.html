<h1>ListArgs Assignment</h1>
</center>

<h2>Due: Midnight March 12, 2003</h2>
<p>Late Points: You will lose 1% of the grade for this assignment for
each day it is late.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Deliverables</h2>

  <p>Send email to <i>vickery@dijkstra</i> with a tar file of your
  empty project directory attached.  Be sure to include "CS-701
  Assignment 3" in the subject line of your email, and put your name and
  ID number in the body of your message.</p>
  
  <p>Typing "make" in the project directory must create a shared
  library named libla.so and install it in the directory $HOME/lib.  It
  must also create a Java class file named ListArgs.class in the
  project directory.  There must be no error or warning messages when
  this make commmand is run.  Your Makefile must also provide targets
  named <i>depend</i> and <i>clean</i> which operate in the usual way,
  also with no warning or error messges.  The Makefile and the Java and
  C++ source files must be coded according to the Coding Guidelines for
  the course, including proper use of RCS keywords.  The only header
  file (other than system-supplied ones) is to be ListArgs.h, which is
  to be built by javah as part of the make process.  Make clean should
  remove all javah-generated header files, which should not be checked
  into RCS.</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

  <p>After running make, the command "listargs ..." must print all the
  command line arguments entered, one per line, and exit.  When your
  program is run, listargs will be an alias for "java ListArgs," and
  the user's LD_LIBRARY_PATH will include $HOME/lib.  I will set up
  this alias and environment variable on my system before testing your
  code; you may do the same on your own system outside of the project,
  such as in your .bashrc file.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This is an exercise in Makefile design and RCS management.  It
  also gives you practice using JNI.  The ListArgs class is to call a
  native C++ method named doMain(), defined in a file named
  ListArgs.cc.  The Java code is to pass a reference to the args
  variable, received by its main() method, to doMain().  The doMain()
  method receives args as a javaobjectArray.  It uses
  <i>GetArrayLength()</i> to find out how long the array is, then uses
  <i>GetObjectArrayElement()</i> to extract successive jstring objects
  from the array, and prints each jstring after converting it to a C
  string using <i>GetStringUTFChars()</i>.  Be sure to release each
  string after printing it.</p>
