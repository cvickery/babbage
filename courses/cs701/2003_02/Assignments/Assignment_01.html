<h1>CS-701 Assignment 1</h1>

<h2>Due: January 29, 2003</h2>

<p>Your first assignment is to send an email message to me at
<b>vickery@qc.edu</b>.  The message must contain "CS-701" in the
subject line, and the body of the message must contain your name, your
student ID number, the user id you would like to use for your computer
accounts for this course, and a "code word" to be used for accessing
your grades for the course.</p>

<p>Your <i>user id</i> is the name you want to use when you log into
the course.  The unix convention is to use just your initials because
it is easy to type, but your full name is fine.  Or, if you prefer,
you can use the same user name as your account on forbin.</p>

<p>The <i>code word</i> can be anything you like, but don't send me a
real password.  (You should never send anyone a real password, not
even a professor!)  Make it secure enough so that it will keep other
people from guessing it to see what your grades in the course are.
Keep it shorter than 12 characters, and don't put any spaces in it.
It will be case-sensitive: whatever you send me will be exactly what
you will have to enter to be able to access your grades online.</p>

<p>The message must come from your own email account.  I will build a
mailing list for the course using this email address, and I will send
announcements and other messages to everyone on the list at various
points throughout the semester.  I will also use this email address for
returning graded homework assignments to you.</p>

<p>If you have more than one email address you would like me to use for
this mailing list, you may send me multiple messages.  Each one
must come from the email address thay you want me to use, each one must
say "CS-701" in the subject line, and each one must have your name and
student ID number in the body.  Exactly one message should contain your
code word, and the other ones must say "Additional email address."</p>

<p>If any of your email addresses change during the semester or if you
forget your code word, send me another message like the one for this
assignment so I can update my records.</p>
