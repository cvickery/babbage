I know you all have other things on your mind these days, but I'd like
you to consider taking part in the search for a new dean of the
Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences.  There will be a search
committee made up of students and faculty who do the search, which
involves reviewing resumes and interviewing candidates.  The acting
dean, Dean Strekas, is applying for the job, but I think there be
other candidates as well.  This is an interesting chance to see how
the college conducts some of its business, and a chance to provide a
needed service to the college as well.

If you are interested in serving on this committee, you have to act
fast.  There is a form for applying, but you can send me email if you
are interested ... before 11:00 am Thursday (2/27).  If you know
someone outside of my courses who might interested, pass this on to
them.  But I need the name(s) and contact information by tomorrow
morning.

Thanks,
Dr. Vickery
