<h2>Class Meetings</h2>

The class meets in Science Building room B-137 from 5:00 to 6:15 PM on
Mondays and Wednesdays.

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Most office hour business can be handled by email.  My address is <a
href="mailto://vickery@qc.edu">vickery@qc.edu</a>.  Be sure to include
"CS-701" in the subject line of every message you send me, and be sure
to include your name in the body of each message.</p>

<p>If you want to see me in person, I will be available in my office,
Science Building room A-222, for half an hour before each class.</p>

<h2>Textbooks</h2>

There are two required textbooks for the course:

    <p class="indent">Stevens, W. Richard
    <br><i>Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment</i>
    <br>Addison-Wesley, 1992
    <br>ISBN 0-201-56317-7</p>

    <p class="indent">Harbison, S. P. and Steele, G. L. Jr.
    <br><i>C: A Reference Manual, Fifth Edition</i>
    <br>Prentice Hall, 1995
    <br>ISBN 0-13-0895929-X</p>


<p>There is one recommended reference book for the course:</p>

    <p class="indent">Das, Sumitabha
    <br><i>Your UNIX: The Ultimate Guide</i>
    <br>McGraw-Hill, 2001
    <br>ISBN 0-07-240500-7</p>


<h2>Assignments and Exams</h2>

<p>Exam and assignment dates are given on the <a
href="./index.html">Course Schedule</a> web page.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>There will be several programming assignments, which will count
  20% of your course grade.  That is, if there are five programming
  assignments, each one will count 4% of your course average.

  <p class="standout">You must submit your own homework solutions, and
  you are expected to write all your own code.  I do not claim I will
  be able to determine whether you actually do so, but if I do detect
  that you submit code based on another person's work, you will
  automatically fail the course. The idea is to use the assignments as
  a way to practice the material covered in the course, not as a test
  of your knowledge.  The assignments will be graded on a 10 point
  scale, and I will provide you with feedback on your assignments
  insofar as I have time to do so. I will also provide copies of
  "correct" solutions to them after the due dates.  I use shell scripts
  to help automate the grading process, and I will provide a copy of
  the script used along with each solution.</p>
  
  <p><b>However</b> <i>I encourage you to interact with your classmates
  while working on the assignments.</i>  These interactions may include
  discussions about coding techniques and help <i>locating</i> (but not
  <i>fixing</i>) bugs.  But the interactions do not include letting
  someone else have a copy of <u>any</u> of your code.  I strongly
  encourage you to use the "Discussion Board" facility for the course
  available through <a href="http://online.qc.edu">QC Online</a> as you
  work on the assignments, both to get answers to questions and to
  provide help to other students in the course.  (You learn a lot by
  helping others.)</p>

  <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam.  The midterm
  will count 40% of your final grade, and the final will count the
  other 40%.

  <p>Exams will be a mixture of short answer questions plus a
  significant amount of code writing.  The code you write will test how
  well you have mastered the programming concepts in the assignments
  you have done.  Note, however, that it will not do any good just to
  memorize code, because the exam questions will be different from the
  assignment solutions.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Check Your Grades</h2>

  <p>You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework and
  exams at the <a href="./check_grades.html">Check Grades</a> web
  page.  To use this facility, you will need to supply a "codeword,"
  which you will supply to me as part of your  <a
  href="./Assignments/Assignment_01.html">first homework
  assignment</a>.</p>

  <p>Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.</p>
