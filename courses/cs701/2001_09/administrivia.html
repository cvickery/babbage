  Reading assignments are on the [&nbsp;<a
  href="./schedule.html">Course Schedule</a>&nbsp;] web page.

<h2>Assignments and Exams</h2>

<ul>
  
  <li>There will be several programming assignments, which will count
  20% of your course grade.  That is, if there are five programming
  assignments, each one will count 4% of your course average.<p>

  You must submit your own homework solutions, and you are expected to
  write all your own code.  I do not claim I will be able to determine
  whether you actually do so, but if I do detect that you submit code
  based on another person's work, you will automatically fail the
  course. The idea is to use the assignments as a way to practice the
  material covered in the course, not as a test of your knowledge.  The
  assignments will be graded on a 5 point scale, and I will provide you
  with feedback on your assignments insofar as I have time to do so. I
  will also provide copies of "correct" solutions to them after the due
  dates.<p>

  <li>There will be one midterm exam and a final exam.  The midterm
  will count 40% of your final grade, and the final will count the
  other 40%.<p>

  Exams will be a mixture of short answer questions plus a significant
  amount of code writing.  The code you write will test how well you
  have mastered the programming concepts in the assignments you have
  done.  Note, however, that it will not work if you just memorize
  code, because the exam questions will be different from the
  assignment solutions.

</ul>

<h2>Check Your Grades</h2>

  You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework and exams
  at the [&nbsp;<a href="check_grades.html">Check Grades</a>&nbsp;] web
  page.  To use this facility, you will need to enter your student ID
  number and a "code word."  The code word is like a password, but it
  is not as secure as a real password because you must tell me what it
  is in order to set it up.  (<b>Never send a real password to anyone,
  not even a professor!</b>)  See [&nbsp;<a
  href="./Assignments/Assignment_1.html">Homework Assignment
  1</a>&nbsp;] for details.<p>

  Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.
