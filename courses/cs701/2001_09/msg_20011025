Oops!  I just sent my email about the midterm exam again instead of the
following.  Sorry.

The course schedule now has a link to the web pages with my code for
Assignment 3.  I noticed when I put it up that the comments for ouch.h
are incomplete.  The permission checking is as done in class, not as
specified in Stevens.  The linked list for the directories in PATH was
not really needed for this assignment.  The malloc for the argument
vector passed as the second argument to execve() was not needed; it
could have been a simple array.
