There is a copy of last semester's midterm exam on the web, with a link
to it from the course schedule web page.

I put this up because some people in the course have access to this
exam, but others don't.  (Or didn't.)  In no way should you expect this
semester's exam to look like last semester's.  Also, I'm sorry, but I
will not have time to answer questions you might have about last
semester's exam.
