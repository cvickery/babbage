<h1>CS-701 Assignment 1</h1>
</center>

Your first assignment is to send an email message to me at
<b>vickery@qc.edu</b>.  The message must contain "CS-701" in the
subject line, and the body of the message must contain your name,
your student ID number, and a "code word" to be used for accessing
your grades for the course.<p>

The code word can be anything you like, but don't send me a real
password.  (You should never send anyone a real password, not even a
professor!)  Make it secure enough so that it will keep other people
from guessing it to see what your grades in the course are.  Keep it
shorter than 12 characters, and don't put any spaces in it.  It will be
case-sensitive: whatever you send me will be exactly what you will have
to enter to be able to access your grades online.<p>

The message must come from your own email account.  You are not allowed
to share accounts for this course.<p>

If you have more than one email address you would like me to use for
messages that I send out, you may send me multiple messages.  Each one
must come from the email address thay you want me to use, each one must
say "CS-701" in the subject line, and each one must have your name and
student ID number in the body.  Exactly one message should contain your
code word, and the other ones must say "Additional email address."<p>

The exact format of the subject line and message body are not critical,
but they must contain the information indicated.<p>

If any of your email addresses change during the semester or if you
forget your code word, send me another message like the one for this
assignment so I can update my records.<p>
