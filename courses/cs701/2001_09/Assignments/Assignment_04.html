<h1>The Ouch Shell</h1>
<h2>Version 2.x</h2>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  In this assignment you will continue development of a Unix shell
  program, begun in Assignment 3.  In this assignment, you will build
  the general structure for an interactive shell, extending the -c
  option you wrote for Assignment 3.  Future assignments will add
  successively more features to the interactive shell.

<h2>Project Management</h2>

  I assume that all files you wrote for Assignment 3 had RCS version
  numbers in the range 1.1 to 1.x, where x might vary from one file to
  another.  If that is not the case, you will need to create a new
  project directory and check in the final version of each Assignment 3
  file as the initial versions of the files for this assignment.  If you
  need to do this, be sure to edit out previous $Id$ and $Log$ sections
  of the files before checking them in to the new RCS subdirectory.  But
  if none of your files have version numbers 2.1 or above, you don't
  have to worry about this: Just use the same project directory you used
  for Assignment 3.<p>

  All files for this assignment are to have version numbers in the range
  2.1 through 2.x.  Check out each file from Assignment 3 for editing
  and, without making any changes, check it in again as version 2.1.
  For example, you would use the following commands for Makefile:<p>

  <pre>
    % co -l Makefile
    % ci -f -r2.1 Makefile
    &gt; No changes.  Starting work on Assignment 4.
    .
    %
  </pre>

  The -r option specifies the revision number you want to use, and the
  -f option forces the check in to succeed even though the file hasn't
  been changed.  Normally, ci won't let you check in a file if you
  haven't actually changed anything in it.<p>

  Future assignments will use version numbers 3.x, 4.x, etc.<p>

<h2>Multiple Source Modules</h2>

  Starting with this assignment, you are required to work with multiple
  source modules.  There is to be a common header file named
  <i>ouch.h</i> which will be included in all other source modules for
  the project.  Put all #include for system header files (stdio.h, etc.)
  in here, along with function prototypes, etc. for the project.  Be
  sure to code this header file so it cannot accidentally be included
  recursively.<p>

  The main() method is to be defined in a file named <i>ouch.cc</i>. 
  For this assignment you will be coding the following methods, each of
  which is to be in its own .cc file:<p>

<table>
  <tr>
  <td width=10%>&nbsp;

    <table border=1 cellpadding=5>

  </table>
</table>

<h2>Requirements for Version 2.x</h2>

Each function description starts with the function prototype for the
function.

<h3>getCommandLine()</h3>

<pre>
    int getCommandLine( char *buf, int max );
</pre>

  If the value of the environment variable "PS1" is set to anything, use
  that as the prompt string to display before reading the command line
  from the user.  If PS1 is not set, print "no-prompt&gt; " as the
  prompt string.<p>

  Use <i>fgets()</i> to read a command line from the user into
  .<i>buf</i>  If a command line ends with a backslash (\), read another
  command line and append it to whatever you have read so far.  When
  reading continuation lines, use the value of "PS2" as the prompt
  string if it is set, and use the string "no-prompt&gt;&gt; " if PS2 is
  not set.  Never store more than  <i>max</i> bytes into <i>buf</i>,
  including the end-of-string '\0'.<p>

  This function returns 0 if it is successful.  It should never fail,
  but would return -1 if it did.

<h3>getSubCommands()</h3>

<pre>
    subcommand_t* getSubcommands( char *buf );
</pre>

  This function receives a complete command line (the one returned by
  <i>getCommandLine()</i>), and returns a pointer to the head of a
  linked list of structures.  The structure type includes a char*
  pointing to a complete command, and a char that contains the
  character that terminated the command, defined like this:

  <pre>
      struct subcommand_t
      {
        char          *cmdString;
        char          termChar;
        token_t       *tokens;
        subcommand_t  *next;
      };
    </pre>

  The <i>tokens</i> field of this structure will be filled in with the
  result of a subsequent call to <i>tokenize()</i>.<p>

  The terminating character will be removed from the command string by
  this function, and returned in the <i>termChar</i> field of the
  subcommand_t structure.  Possible terminating characters are ';',
  '&', '|', '\0', and possibly other characters to be added in future
  versions of the shell.  (For example, <i>ksh</i> lets you type a
  subcommand inside parentheses, which makes the command run in a
  "subshell."  The terminating character would be ')' in that case.)<p>

  You need to code this function so it does not get fooled by
  terminating characters that appear inside strings or which are escaped
  by backslashes.  For example, the following is all one subcommand,
  terminated by '\0':<p>
  
  <pre>
      echo 'Semicolons (;) & pipes (|)' \& " ||| " are nice.
  </pre>
  
  There are three quote characters this function should recognize:
  single ('), double ("), and backquote (`).  The function does not have
  to recognize nested quotes, like "The character '!' is nice."<p>

  The memory for the linked list will have to be allocated dynamically,
  but the cmdString pointers may be pointers into the <i>buf</i>
  parameter.  That is, this function may modify <i>buf</i>, much the way
  <i>strtok()</i> modifies the strings it tokenizes.<p>

<h3>tokenize()</h3>

<pre>
  token_t *tokenize( const subcommand_t *cmd );
</pre>

  This function returns the head of a linked list of token_t structures
  defined as follows:

  <pre>
    struct token_t
    {
      char          *token;
      token_tag_t   tag;
      token_t       *next;
    };
</pre>

  The tag for each token with be taken from the following list of
  enumerated values:
  
<table>
  <tr>
  <td width=10%>&nbsp;
  <td>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=5>
    <tr>
      <th>Value
      <th>Meaning
    <tr>
      <td><b>T_default</b>
      <td>A token that is neither a string nor a redirection operator.

    <tr>
      <td><b>T_double_quote</b>
      <td>A token that was enclosed in double quotes (<b>"</b>).  The double
      quotes are not part of the token.

    <tr>
      <td><b>T_single_quote</b>
      <td>A token that was enclosed in single quotes (<b>'</b>).  The
      single quotes are not part of the token.

    <tr>
      <td><b>T_back_quote</b>
      <td>A token that was enclosed in back quotes (<b>`</b>).  The
      back quotes are not part of the token.

    <tr>
      <td><b>T_redirect_in</b>
      <td>A token for input redirection (<b>&lt;</b>).

    <tr>
      <td><b>T_redirect_out</b>
      <td>A token for output redirection (<b>&gt;</b>).

    <tr>

      <td><b>T_redirect_append</b>
      <td>A token for output redirection with the append option
      (<b>&gt;&gt;</b>).

    <tr>
      <td><b>T_redirect_clobber</b>
      <td>A token for output redirection with the "clobber" option
      (<b>&gt;!</b>).

  </table>
</table><p>

  This function does not modify the string passed to it because the
  character that terminates one token might be the beginning of the
  next one, so there is no easy way to instert '\0' characters to break
  up the original string.  Rather, the memory for the tokens has to be
  allocated dynamically.<p>
  
  Note that strings enclose tokens.  The <i>echo</i> command listed
  above contains six tokens:

  <ol>
    <li>"echo"
    <li>"Semicolons (;) & pipes (|)"
    <li>"&"
    <li>" | | | "
    <li>"are"
    <li>"nice."
  </ol>

  The quotes in the list above are not part of the tokens; they are
  there to show you where there are spaces inside tokens.  This
  function  should recognize the I/O redirection operators as tokens
  even if they are not separated from other tokens by whitespace.<p>

  Although you can't use this code directly, the function [&nbsp;<a
  href="./strtok2.cc.html">strtok2()</a>&nbsp;] might give you some
  ideas how to work on the design of this function.<p>

<h3>expandToken()</h3>

<pre>
    char *expandToken( const char *token )
</pre>

    This function is called by the main program for each token
    that is of type T_default or T_double_quote.  If the token is the
    string "$?", this function substitutes a string representing the
    previous command's result code for the token.  Otherwise, this
    function returns the same pointer that was passed to it.  Since
    tokens are allocated memory dynamically, this function must free the
    pointer passed to it if it does perform a substitution.

<h3>executeCommand()</h3>

<pre>
    int executeCommand( subcommand_t *cmd );
</pre>

    This function executes a single command, which might be either a
    builtin command or an external command.  It returns the "result code"
    for the command, which is the exit code for external commands, or
    the the return code for builtin commands.  If the command is neither
    an external command nor a builtin command, this function writes an
    error message to stderr and returns the value 1.

<h2>Development Strategy</h2>

For Version 2.x of this project, your program is to implement <i>only
the following features <b>and no more!</b></i>  You will lose credit if
this version of your program does anything more than the following:

<ul>
  <li>Do a complete implementation of <i>getCommandLine()</i> as described
  above.
  <li>Code <i>getSubcommands()</i> so that it simply returns the command
  line passed to it.  That is, it doesn't actually break lines into
  subcommands at all.  When testing your program, don't type in
  subcommands.
  <li>Code <i>tokenize()</i> so that it recognizes only
  whitespace-separated tokens and does not handle quotes or redirection.
  The full version of this function will be part of Version 3.x of the
  assignment.  <b>Note:</b> If you have already coded a version of
  <i>tokenize()</i> that does more than this requirement by the time you
  read this web page, you may leave your code intact.  But it will have
  to match the definition of <i>tokenize()</i> described above for
  Version 3.x.
  <li>Code <i>expandToken()</i> so it just returns the pointer passed to
  it.
  <li>Code <i>executeCommand()</i> so it generates proper values of the
  traditional variables <i>argc</i> and <i>argv</i> suitable for passing
  to a <i>main()</i> function.  If argv[0] is the name of an executable
  file (use your previous version of <i>findExecutable()</i>), execute
  the command.  Code <i>wait()</i> so that this function determines the
  command's exit code, and return that value as the return value for
  this function.  If the command does not name an executable file, print
  a "command not found" message and return 1.
</ul>

Recode <i>main()</i> so that something like the following gets executed
if the user doesn't type any command line options:<p>

<pre>
    int result;
    char inBuf[ 1024 ];
    while ( true )
    {
      //  Read a command line
      result = getCommandLine( inBuf, sizeof( inBuf ) );
      if ( result != 0 )
      {
        fprintf( stderr, "Error reading command line\n" );
        continue;
      }
      fprintf ( stderr, "Result: %d\nStrlen: %d\nCommand: %s\n", 
                        result, strlen( inBuf ), inBuf );
      
      //  Break line into subcommands and tokenize each one
      subcommand_t *cmd_list = getSubcommands( inBuf );
      if ( 0 == cmd_list )
        continue; //  Empty command line
      subcommand_t *cmd = cmd_list;
      while ( cmd )
      {
        token_t *token_list = tokenize( cmd );
        if ( 0 == token_list )
          continue; // Not empty, but no tokens
        cmd->tokens = token_list;
        // execute it
        exitCode = executeCommand( cmd );
        cmd = cmd->next;
      }
    }
</pre><p>

The main purpose of Version 2.x of the assignment is to be sure your
project is set up with the proper source modules and Makefile.  Be sure
"make clean" leaves your project directory with nothing but the RCS
subdirectory in it, be sure that "make" builds program correctly
after you run "make clean,", be sure "make" recompiles only those files
you have edited since the last make, and be sure that the sequence
"touch ouch.h ; make" recompiles everything before linking.<p>

Be sure to test your program carefully to be sure it works.  In
particular, be sure nothing happens in interactive mode if the user
types an empty command line.  Be sure prompt strings are handled
correctly; you will probably find that the PS1 and PS2 variables are
already set up if you log into a Linux account, and the prompt printed
for PS1 will not be "pretty."  But on forbin you will have to set up
your own values for PS1 and PS2.

<h2>Due Date and Grading Criteria</h2>

The due date for this assignment is midnight Thursday, December 6, but
no late points will be deducted for assignments submitted as late as
midnight December 13.  This assignment will not be accepted after
December 13.<p>

The assignment will be graded on a 5-point scale, with each of the
following counting approximately equally:

<ul>

    <li>Does the tar file contain a subdirectory for the project, is the
    project directory empty except for an RCS subdirectory, and possibly
    a file named README (spelled and capitalized exactly like that)?

    <li>Does the following procedure build the ouch application with no
    warnings or error messages:  Checkout a copy of Makefile, locked
    for editing; type the command "(g)make depend," and check the
    Makefile back in; type the command "(g)make."
    
    <li>Does "touch ouch.h; (g)make" recompile everything, and does
    "(g)make clean" remove everything from the project directory other
    than the RCS subdirectory and possibly the README file?  Do all the
    files for the project have RCS version numbers in the 2.x range?
    
    <li>Are the source modules named in the assignment handout all
    present, and are all required functions defined using the proper
    function prototypes?  Are the source modules coded and documented
    according to the coding guidelines for the course?

    <li>Does the program manage PS1 and PS2 environment variables
    correctly, does the program interactively handle a sequence of
    simple command lines (external commands with any number of
    arguments; empty command lines; commands with names of nonexistent
    files) correctly; and does the program process the -c command line
    option correctly?  Do both subcommands entered on the command line
    and those entered interactively receive the correct environment?  In
    interactive mode, does a backslash at the end of a line allow the
    user to continue a command line correctly?

</ul>

<b>Note: </b>Your program may implement more features than specified
here, and that is okay.  But only the features listed here will be
examined for this assignment.
