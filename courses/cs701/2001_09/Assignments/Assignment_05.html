<h1>The Ouch Shell</h1>
<h2>Version 3.x</h2>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

In this assignment you will continue development of a Unix shell
program you began in Assignments 3 and 4.  This assignment gives you
the opportunity to add features to the somewhat rudamentary shell
specified in Assignment 4, and adds the requirement that you write a
man page for your shell.

<h2>Project Management</h2>

All files for this assignment are to have version numbers in the range
3.1 through 3.x.  Check out each file from Assignment 4 for editing
and, without making any changes, check it in again as version 3.1 in a
manner analogous to the way you started work on Assignment 4.


<h2>Requirements for Version 3.x</h2>

Each function description starts with the function prototype for the
function.

<h3>getCommandLine()</h3>

<pre>
    int getCommandLine( char *buf, int max );
</pre>

This code should not need to be changed from what you wrote for
Assignment 4.

<h3>getSubCommands()</h3>

<pre>
    subcommand_t* getSubcommands( char *buf );
</pre>

You might not need to change your code for Assignment 4 for this
function.  But whereas you were required only to handle simple command
lines in the previous assignment, this assignment will test whether you
actually can handle multiple commands separated by semicolons
correctly.  Handling an ampersand at the end of a command line will be
tested if you mention it in your man page, but is not required.  Be
sure to test all kinds of quoting as mentioned in Assignment 4.  If
there are any limitations on what your code handles properly here, be
sure to list them in the BUGS section of your man page.


<h3>tokenize()</h3>

<pre>
  token_t *tokenize( const subcommand_t *cmd );
</pre>

Your tokenize function should handle quotes and I/O redirection
operators correctly for this assignment.  (These features were not
tested for Assignment 4.)  There should be no need to surround
redirection operators with spaces.  Thus the strings ">out" and
">&nbsp;&nbsp;out" are equivalent.  Either one should both result in a
single token_t node with the <i>token</i> member pointing to "out" and
the <i>tag</i> member equal to T_redirect_out.

<h3>expandToken()</h3>

<pre>
    char *expandToken( const char *token )
</pre>


The $? token should be handled properly in this Assignment.  In
addition, you may optionally include support for $$ (the shell's
process id).

<h3>executeCommand()</h3>

<pre>
    int executeCommand( subcommand_t *cmd );
</pre>

For this assignment, you are to handle builtin commands using a dispatch
table as outlined in class.<p>

Use this prototype for all builtin functions:

<pre>
      typedef int builtin_t( int, char **, char ** );
</pre>

Then you can use this struct for the dispatch table entries:

<pre>
struct dispatch_t 
{
      const char  *const cmdName;
      builtin_t   *function;
      bool        canFork;
};
</pre>

The purpose of the <i>canFork</i> member of the struct is to mark
whether it is all right to fork a separate process to execute the
builtin command or not.  The cd and exit builtin commands must not
execute in separate processes because they have to modify ouch's
process.  But other builtins can be executed in separate processes, and
will have to if their input or output streams are redirected.

<h2>Builtin Commands</h2>

Set up your builtin command dispatch table so it associates the
following command names and functions:<p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5">

<tr>
  <th>Command Name
  <th>Function
  <th>Can Fork?

<tr>
  <td>exit
  <td><i>doExit()</i>
  <td>No

<tr>
  <td>quit
  <td><i>doExit()</i>
  <td>No

<tr>
  <td>print
  <td><i>doPrint()</i>
  <td>Yes

<tr>
  <td>cd
  <td><i>doCd()</i>
  <td>No

</table><p>

(Thought question:  What would be a better way to have two different
names for the same command, as accomplished by the first two entries in
the above table?)<p>

<h3><i>exit</i> and <i>quit</i></h3>
Typing either of these commands should exit the shell.<p>

Optional:  Study Chapter 10 of the Stevens book and modify <i>ouch</i>
so it does not exit if the user types Control-C.  Be sure this feature
works correctly whether the user has started typing a command line when
s/he types Control-C or not.

<h3><i>print</i></h3>

This is ouch's version of other shells' <i>echo</i> command.  It prints
each of its command line arguments separated from each other by exactly
one space. While the <i>doPrint()</i> function is simple to implement,
what it prints out will tell whether your <i>tokenize()</i> function is
implemented correctly.  It also tests whether result codes and token
expansion are working correctly.<p>

<i>Code this function so that it's own result code is equal to the
number of command line arguments it prints.</i><p>

Sample output:
<pre>
      ouch> date; print The value of '$?' is $?
      Mon Dec 10 19:22:36 EST 2001
      The value of $? is 0
      ouch> print "Previous result code was:   " $?
      Previous result code was:    6
      ouch>
</pre>

<h2>I/O Redirection</h2>

If your <i>tokenize()</i> function is working, this part is quite
simple to implement.  While building the argument vector to pass as the
second argument to <i>execve()</i> or to a builtin_t function, pull out
any redirection tokens, opening the specified file with the proper mode
based on the type of redirection.  After forking, use the <i>dup2()</i>
system call to put the fd in its proper "slot" (0 for stdin, 1 for
stdout).  For example, you could declare an int named
stdinRedirection_fd that is initialized to -1 for each command.  If you
find a token of type T_redirect_in, open the file named by the token for
reading (O_RDONLY) and save the fd returned by <i>open()</i> in
stdinRedirect_fd.  Then after forking, you have the child process
execute code like:

<pre>
      if ( stdinRedir_fd != -1 )
      {
        dup2( stdinRedir_fd, 0 );
        close( stdinRedir_fd );
      }
</pre>

Here are the flags to use for opening the three types of output
redirection.  In all cases, the mode value (the third argument passed to
<i>open()</i>) should be 0666.  (Remember that the 0 means octal.)<p>

<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="5">
  <tr>
    <td>T_redirect_out
    <td>O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_EXCL
  <tr>
    <td>T_redirect_append
    <td>O_WRONLY | O_APPEND
  <tr>
    <td>T_redirect_clobber
    <td>O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC
</table>

<h2>ouch.1</h2>

Provide a <i>man</i> page for the project in a file named
<code>ouch.1</code>, which is to be under RCS management (with a
revision number of 3.x) just like the other files you wrote for this
assignment.  You may optinally have man and man/man1 subdirectories in
your project directory, and you may include an "install" target for
your man page that installs it there.<p>

Your man page will be graded on grammatical correctness and meaningfulness
of content in addition to proper formatting, as described in the man
pages document listed in the course schedule.

<h2>Due Date</h2>

You may accept this assignment as late as midnight December 21, but no
later.
