<h1>CS-701 Assignment 3</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is the first version of a project we will be developing throughout
this semester: to write an interactive shell, akin to <i>sh</i>,
<i>csh</i>, <i>bash</i>, etc.  In the spirit of Unix shell-naming, we
will call <u>ou</u>r <u>sh</u>ell, <i>ouch</i>.<p>

This first version of the shell won't actually be an interactive
program.  Instead, <i>ouch</i> will execute a "sub-command" that the
user enters on the ouch command line following a <code>-c</code>
command line option.<p>

For example, the following would be a valid invocation of <i>ouch</i>:

<pre>
      % ouch -c ls -l
</pre>

In this example, the '%' is the user's shell's prompt, ouch is the name
of the command, -c is the -c command line option, and the sub-command to be
executed is "ls -l".

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Write a C++ program named <i>ouch</i>, which accepts the command line
option "-c" followed by a sub-command line.  Your program is to print
the full pathname of the executable file given as the name of the
sub-command, or an error message if such an executable file cannot be
found.  If the executable file is found, build the parameters for the
<i>execve()</i> system call and execute the sub-command.  If the
<i>execve()</i> command fails, print an appropriate error message.<p>

If the user enters any option other than "-c" or omits the "-c" before
the sub-command line, it is an error, and your program is to print an
error message showing proper invocation syntax, and exit.  However, if
the user gives no command line arguments at all, the program is to exit
normally, with no error message.<p>

Your program must be coded according to the [&nbsp;<a
href="../../Coding_Guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</a>&nbsp;] for
this course.  This includes the requirement that the program must
compile and link with no error or warning messages, in addition to
running correctly.  It also includes the requirement that the program
must be properly documented.<p>

You are to use RCS to manage the files in this project.  For this
assignment, that means the files named Makefile and ouch.cc.  Be sure
both files contain proper $Id$ and $Log$ RCS macros in appropriate
places.  (See the Coding Guidelines if in doubt.)<p>

Because the project uses only a single source module,
<code>ouch.cc</code>, there is no need for a <i>make</i> rule for
building the executable file, <i>ouch</i>.  Thus, in addition to
comments and variable definitions, the Makefile for the assignment is
to include only a rule for the target "clean" like the following:

<pre>
      clean :
      &lt;tab&gt; rcsclean
      &lt;tab&gt; rm -f core ouch
</pre>

<h2>Project Management Requirements</h2>

Create a project directory for the assignment as described in the coding
guidelines.  Write the code as a single source module named
<code>ouch.cc</code>, which you are to compile into an executable file
named <code>ouch</code> using the following command line:

<pre>
      make ouch
</pre>

The above command must be expanded by <i>make</i> to the following
command, which must produce no warning or error messages:

<pre>
      g++ -g -Wall -Wwrite-strings ouch.cc -o ouch
</pre>

This example assumes that <code>ouch.cc</code> is already in the
project directory.  If it and the Makefile are absent, <i>make</i> will
check them out first, and remove ouch.cc at the end.<p>

Note that the following variables must be defined either in your
Makefile or in your environment:

<pre>
        CC = g++
        CXXFLAGS = -g -Wall -Wwrite-strings
</pre>

When I test your program, they will both be defined in my environment.

<h2>Coding Requirements</h2>

Your code must use the following functions to perform the indicated
tasks:<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width=95%>

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>getopt()
    <td>To process command line options.

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>perror()
    <td>To print any error messages due to system call failures.

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>fprintf()
    <td>To print error messages to stderr, other than the ones that
    <i>perror()</i> handles.

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>getenv()
    <td>To get the value of the PATH environment variable.

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>strtok()
    <td>To divide the value of the PATH environment variable into a list
    of directories.

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>stat()<br>getuid()<br>getgid()
    <td>To determine if a file exists, and if the user has permission to
    execute it.

  <tr>
    <td width=10%>execve()
    <td>To execute the file.

</table></center><p>

<h2>Due Date</h2>

Test your program carefully before creating the tar file and submitting
it.<p>

Create a clean project directory (a directory containing only the RCS
subdirectory, with Makefile,v and ouch.cc,v in the RCS subdirectory
under RCS control), put the project directory into a tar file, and send
the tar file to me as an email attachment by <b>midnight October
18</b>.  Note: when I extract the contents of your tar file, I should
get a subdirectory under the current directory for your project
directory, and an RCS subdirectory under that.<p>

<b>Be sure the Subject line of your email message says, "CS-701
Assignment 3."</b>
