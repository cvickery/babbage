The final exam will test your understanding of the development tools
used in this course as well as your ability to write code based on the
programming techniques developed in the course assignments, following
instructions provided in the exam.  The following parts of the Stevens
book may prove helpful in preparing for the exam, although material in
the book not mentioned in class and not needed for the assignments
probably will not be tested: Chapters 1-5, 7, 8, 10, and the first parts
of chapters 6 and 14.  The various web pages providing tutorial material
on make, gdb, rcs, and writing man pages will also be covered.
