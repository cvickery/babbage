The grades for CS-701 are ready now.  I just sent out the reports for
Assignments 4 and 5, and here are the statistics for the final exam
and the course:

  Exam Average: 79.3
  Exam Median:  84.0
  Course Grades
    A   8
    B   6
    C   8
    F   7

  Your course average was computed by weighting the two exams 40% each
  and the assignments 5% each, except for Assignement 1, for which an
  "ok" was worth 1 point added to your average.  If one exam grade was
  10 points less than the other one, its weight was reduced to 35%,
  and the other exam counted 45%.  (Note: this weight adjustment was
  not in effect when I posted grades at 11:31 this morning, so be sure
  you look at the 12:26 update.)  The translation from course average
  to letter grades is a mechanical process dictated by the college's
  grading policy, described in the College Bulletin.

  Best wishes for a good break and a Happy New Year,
  Dr. Vickery
