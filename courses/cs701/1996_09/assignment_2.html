When the assignment is complete, send me an e-mail message telling me the
path to the project directory.  The project directory
is to contain an RCS subdirectory, and nothing else.  In
addition, the <code>~/man</code> directory tree is to contain
a <i>man</i> page for the executable program.  You may also leave a
<code>README</code> file in the project directory if you think that one
is needed, but I neither expect nor require you to do so.

<H2>Project Overview</H2>


You are to do the exercise as a sequence of steps as listed below, and
the code for each step is to have its own RCS major version number. 
Because you will have to add modules in some of the later steps, there
should be a different version of the project Makefile for each step,
too.<P>

<H2>Project Steps</H2>

<ol>

<li>

Write a function, <i>parseURL</i> which takes a pointer to a C string as
an argument, and returns the following struct:

<pre>
          struct parsedURL {
            char*    protocol;
            char*    hostname;
            char*    portNumber;
            char*    pathName;
            };
</pre>

When the struct is returned, the <code>protocol</code> field will
normally point to the string "http" or "file".  However, it will be a
NULL pointer if the string begins with a different protocol name or if
there is an error in the string that makes it impossible to parse.  If
the protocol is http, the hostname and portNumber fields must be
defined, although the portNumber field will be be defined as NULL if
the URL does not specify a port number.  If protocol field is a
non-NULL pointer, pathName must be a non-NULL pointer too.  If the
pathname part of the URL string is missing, make the pathName member
point to the string "/".<p>

Write a main program that accepts a URL string as a command line
argument.  (If no command line argument is given, the program simply
terminates.)  Pass the command line argument to <i>parseURL()</i> and
use <code>ddd</code> to verify that the string is parsed correctly.  Try
different URL strings to test your program fully.  Have the program
exit when <i>parseURL()</i> returns.<P>

At this point, your project directory should have the following
files:<P>
<dl>
<dt><code>Makefile</code><dd>Typing <i>make</i> with no arguments should
build the executable program.
<dt><code>parseURL.h</code><dd>This file should contain the declaration
for the parsedURL data structure and the function prototype for
<i>parseURL()</i>.
<dt><code>parseURL.cc</code><dd>Source code for the <i>parseURL()</i>
function definition.  (Since you are using the g++ compiler, you might
as well use the <code>.cc</code> extension instead of <code>.c</code>.)
<dt><code>main.cc</code><dd>Source code for your <i>main()</i> function
definition.<P>
</dl>
You may use different file names if you wish, but you should have the
equivalent of these four files.  When the program works, check these
four files into RCS as version 1.1.


<li>Create a skeleton implementation of the entire browser project. 
Include the following modules:
  <ul>

  <li><B>main</B> - The function <i>main()</i> uses the environment
  variable <code>USER_INTERFACE</code> to determine which user interface
  to use.  Recognize "curses" and "motif," and use a dispatch table to
  call the appropriate initialization code for the selected interface. 
  Pass a pointer to <code>argc</code> and <code>argv</code> as
  parameters to the interface initialization routine.  You may use
  "curses" as the default value if <code>USER_INTERFACE</code> is not set.
  The interface initialization function will not return to
  <i>main()</i>.

  <li><B>processURL</B> - This module should include functions to parse
  a URL, to call one of the protocol handlers (see below) to get a
  document, one to parse a raw (HTML) document into paragraphs and text
  segments, and one to free whatever resources have been allocated to
  the processing of a particular URL.  For now the HTML parser should
  create a single paragraph with a single text segment that includes
  the entire raw document.

  <li><B>fileProtocol</B> - There must be two functions, one to map a
  file into memory, and one to unmap it.  The address of the first
  function is to be one of the entries a table of protocol handlers
  defined in the <code>processURL</code> module.  This handler puts the
  address of the other function in the <code>urlInfo_t</code> structure
  for the URL.

  <li><B>httpProtocol</B> - Provide a stub function that prints a message
  saying "HTTP protocol not implmented yet!", and put its address in the
  table of protocol handlers defined in the <code>processURL</code>
  module.

  <li><B>cursesUI</B> - Initialize the Curses user interface.  If there
  was an argument on the command line when the program was invoked,
  process the URL, and pass the processed URL information to a function
  that is local to this module, which displays the first screenful of
  the document.  If there is no command line argument or if the command
  line argument cannot be processed to produce a parsed document,
  display a message telling the user what to do, and exit.

  <li><B>motifUI</B> - Provide a stub function that issues a message
  saying "Motif user interface not implemented yet!" and exit.

  </ul>

Here is a data structure you might use to hold the information about a
URL at the various stages of its processing:<p>
<pre>
struct urlInfo_t {

  // The original URL string.
  const char*   urlString;

  // Parsed Substrings of the URL string.
  char*         protocolName;
  char*         hostName;
  char*         portNumber;
  char*         pathName;

  // Raw Document Information.
  caddr_t       rawStart;
  size_t        rawLength;
  freeDoc_f*    freeDoc;

  // Parsed Document Information.
  paraInfo_t   *firstPara;

  };
</pre>

When you have this program working, check in all files, including the
Makefile, as version 2.1 of your project.

<li>Complete a working Curses user interface for the project.  The user
is to be able to enter the following command characters, with the
indicated effects:

  <ul>
  <li><code>'q'</code> - Exit the program.
  <li><code>KEY_DOWN</code> - Scroll down one line in the displayed
  document.
  <li><code>KEY_UP</code> - Scroll up one line in the displayed
  document.
  <li><code>KEY_NPAGE</code> - Scroll down one screenful.
  <li><code>KEY_PPAGE</code> - Scroll up one page.
  </ul>

If the user presses any other key, the program should beep.  This is
version 3.1 of the project.

<li>Add the <code>'g'</code> command to your Curses user interface that
prompts for a URL string and processes it.  This is version 4.1 of the
project.

<li>Implement the http protocol handler so that documents can be
retrieved from World Wide Web servers.  This is version 5.1 of the
project.

<li>Parse HTML documents into paragraphs.  Remove all HTML tags, and use
<code>&lt;P&gt;</code> and &lt;H<i>n</i>&gt;</code> pairs to divide the
document into paragraphs.  Modify your Curses renderer to display
paragraphs properly.  This is version 6.1 of the project.
