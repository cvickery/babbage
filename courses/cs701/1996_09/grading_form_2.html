<H1 ALIGN=center>Grading Form for HTML Document Processor</H1>

<h3>PROJECT MANAGEMENT (2.5 points)</h3>

<blockquote>

The project directory must contain only an RCS subdirectory when
I grade the assignment.  Typing "make" must build the executable
program.  All files under RCS management must include proper RCS
macros, <code>$Id$</code> and <code>$Log$</code>.  Each version
of each file must have a meaningful RCS comment.<p>

It must be possible to re-create each step of the assignment from the
RCS history for the project.  After checking out the Makefile for a
version, typing "make" should check out the proper source files for that
version and build the executable program for that step of the
assignment.<p>

</blockquote>

<h3>USER DOCUMENTATION (2.0 points)</h3>

<blockquote>

Is there a <i>man</i> page with the same file name as the
program and an appropriate extension installed in the proper directory?
Is the man page written for the proper audience (end users)?  Does the
structure match that of standard Unix <i>man</i> pages; is the
information well organized?  Is the information presented clearly,
completely, and yet concisely?<p>

There should be just one man page, for the final version of the program.
A separate <code>README</code> file should document the differences
among the earlier versions of the project.<p>
