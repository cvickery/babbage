<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Grading Form for Exercise 1</h1>


<h3>PROJECT MANAGEMENT (2.5 points)</h3>

<blockquote>

The project directory must contain only an RCS subdirectory when
I grade the assignment.  Typing "make" must build the executable
program.  All files under RCS management must include proper RCS
macros, <code>$Id$</code> and <code>$Log$</code>.  Each version
of each file must have a meaningful RCS comment.<p>

</blockquote>

<h3>USER DOCUMENTATION (2.5 points)</h3>

<blockquote> Is there a <i>man</i> page with the same file name as the
program and an appropriate extension installed in the proper directory?
Is the man page written for the proper audience (end users)?  Does the
structure match that of standard Unix <i>man</i> pages; is the
information well organized?  Is the information presented clearly,
completely, and yet concisely?<p> Are there <i>man</i> pages for your
<i>vopen()</i> and <i>vgetc()</i> functions?  Are they in the proper
format for functions (as opposed to commands), and are they installed in
the right directory?<p> <P> </blockquote>

<h3>CODING STYLE AND DOCUMENTATION (2.5 points)</h3>

<blockquote>

Does the code adhere to the <A HREF="../coding_guidelines.html">Coding
Guidelines</A> for this course?<P>

Is the header file properly documented, just like the other source
files?<p>

</blockquote>

<h3>CODE FUNCTIONALITY (2.5 points)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Are command line arguments handled properly?
<li>Is the <code>V_BUF_SIZE</code> environment variable used properly?
<li>Does the program work for copying both text and binary files?
<li>Does the <i>vcopy</i> package work with other application programs?
</ul>

<h3>LATE POINTS AND EXTRA FEATURES</h3>

<blockquote>
You will lose 0.1 point for each day your assignment is late.<P>

It is generally possible to get a few tenths of a point of extra
credit for doing
things that go beyond the basic requirements of the assignment.<P>

Each assignment is graded on a 10.0 point scale.<P>
