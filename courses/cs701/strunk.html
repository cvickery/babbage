There are many handbooks that give principles of good English language
writing style.  One of the best known is <i>Elements of Style</i> by
William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White, which was published by the
Macmillan Company in 1959.  That book is a modified version of a
student handbook written by Professor Strunk at Cornell University in
1918.<p>

There is an on-line copy of the 1918 version of <i>Elements of Style</i>
