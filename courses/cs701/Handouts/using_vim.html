<h1>Setting Up Vim</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>If you are using any of the standard Linux distributions, you
probably already have a version of vim already installed on your
system.  If you want to get the most-current version, either for
Unix/Linux or for Windows, go to the <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim
web site</a> and follow the directions there for downloading and
installing the editor.</p>


<h2>Adjust your <i>.vimrc</i> file</h2>

<p>The installation program normally puts a file named
<code>.vimrc</code> in your home directory.  On Windows, the file will
be named <code>_vimrc</code>, and will be in the directory where Vim
was installed.  For example, when I installed version 6.1, it was
placed in <code>D:\Utils\Vim\vim61</code>, and the <code>_vimrc</code>
file was put in <code>D:\Utils\Vim</code>.  Also, the Windows
environment variable, <code>VIM</code>, was set to
<code>D:\Utils\Vim</code>.</p>

<p>The standard .vimrc file supplied with the Vim distribution is not
quite
correct for use in this course.  You need to set the tab width to
something small, you must set the option to replace tabs with spaces,
and you need to tell vim to wrap lines longer than 72 characters.  I
also have some keyboard shortcuts that I like to use, mostly so I can
enter certain commands while I am in insert mode.  Here are links to two
.vimrc files, <a href="./windoze_vimrc.html">one for Windows</a> and <a
href="./unix_vimrc.html">one for Unix</a> that you may use as a
model for your own.  Feel free to modify them as you wish, but be sure
not to change the expandtab and tw options!
</p>

<h2>Reference Material</h2>

<p>There are lots of tutorials on vi and vim on the Web.  One site
that's very good is <a
href="http://users.erols.com/astronaut/vim/">Dr.  Chip's Vim Page</a>.
There's also a big book on Vim, <i>Vi IMproved -- Vim</i> by Steve
Oualline published in 2001 by New Riders Press (ISBN 0-7357-1001-5).
(That's not a typo; the author's last name starts with 'O' not
'Q').</p>
