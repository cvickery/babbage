  <H1>BSD Sockets: A Quick And Dirty Primer</H1>

As you delve into the mysteries of UNIX, you find more  and  more
things  that  are  difficult  to  understand immediately.  One of
these things, at  least  for  most  people,  is  the  BSD  socket
concept.   This  is a short tutorial that explains what they are,
how they work, and gives sample code showing how to use them.<p>


<center>
                           <B>The Analogy</B><BR>
               (or:  What <I>IS</I> a socket, anyway?)<p>
</center>
The <I>socket</I> is  the  BSD  method  for  accomplishing  interprocess
communication  (IPC).   What  this  means  is a socket is used to
allow one process  to  speak  to  another,  very  much  like  the
telephone is used to allow one person to speak to another.<p>

The telephone analogy is a  very  good  one,  and  will  be  used
repeatedly to describe socket behavior.<p>


<center>
                    <B>Installing Your New Phone</B><BR>
           (or:  How to listen for socket connections)<p>
</center>

In order for a person to receive telephone calls, he  must  first have
a telephone installed.  Likewise you must create a socket to listen for
connections.  This  process  involves  several  steps. First  you 
must  make a new socket, which is similar to having a telephone line
installed.  The <I>socket()</I> command  is  used  to  do this.<p>

Since sockets can have several types, you must specify what  type of
socket you want when you create one.  One option that you have is the
addressing format of a socket.  Just as the  mail  service uses  a 
different  scheme  to  deliver  mail  than the telephone company uses
to complete calls, so can sockets differ.   The  two most  common
addressing schemes are <CODE>AF_UNIX</CODE> and <CODE>AF_INET</CODE>. 
AF_UNIX addressing uses UNIX pathnames to identify sockets; these
sockets are  very  useful  for IPC between processes on the same
machine. AF_INET addressing uses Internet addresses which  are  four 
byte numbers  usually  written  as  four  decimal numbers separated by
periods (such as  192.9.200.10).   In  addition  to  the  machine
address,  there  is also a port number which allows more than one
AF_INET socket on each machine.  AF_INET addresses  are  what  we will
deal with here.<p>

Another option which you must supply when creating  a  socket  is the 
type  of  socket.  The two most common types are
<CODE>SOCK_STREAM</CODE> and <CODE>SOCK_DGRAM</CODE>.  SOCK_STREAM
indicates that data will come across the  socket as a stream of
characters, while SOCK_DGRAM indicates that data will come in bunches
(called datagrams).   We  will  be dealing with SOCK_STREAM sockets,
which are very common.<p>

After creating a socket, we must give the socket  an  address  to
listen  to,  just  as  you get a telephone number so that you can
receive calls.  The <I>bind()</I> function is used to do this (it 
binds a socket to an address, hence the name).<p>

SOCK_STREAM type sockets  have  the  ability  to  queue  incoming
connection  requests,  which  is a lot like having "call waiting" for
your telephone.  If you are busy handling a  connection,  the
connection  request  will  wait  until you can deal with it.  The
<I>listen()</I> function is used to set the maximum number  of 
requests (up  to  a  maximum  of five, usually) that will be queued
before requests start being denied.  While it is not  necessary  to 
use the listen() function, it's good practice.<p>

The following function shows how to use the socket(), bind(), and
listen() functions to establish a socket which can accept calls:<p>

<pre>
  /* code to establish a socket; originally from bzs@bu-cs.bu.edu
   */

  int establish(portnum)
  u_short portnum;
  { char   myname[MAXHOSTNAME+1];
    int    s;
    struct sockaddr_in sa;
    struct hostent *hp;

    bzero(&amp;sa,sizeof(struct sockaddr_in));      /* clear our address */
    gethostname(myname,MAXHOSTNAME);            /* who are we? */
    hp= gethostbyname(myname);                  /* get our address info */
    if (hp == NULL)                             /* we don't exist !? */
      return(-1);
    sa.sin_family= hp-&gt;h_addrtype;              /* this is our host address */
    sa.sin_port= htons(portnum);                /* this is our port number */
    if ((s= socket(AF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,0)) &lt; 0) /* create socket */
      return(-1);
    if (bind(s,&amp;sa,sizeof sa,0) &lt; 0) {
      close(s);
      return(-1);                               /* bind address to socket */
    }
    listen(s, 3);                               /* max # of queued connects */
    return(s);
  }
</pre>

After you create a socket to get calls, you must wait  for  calls to 
that  socket.   The  <I>accept()</I>  function  is  used to do this.
Calling accept() is analogous to picking up the telephone if it's
ringing.  Accept() returns a new socket which is connected to the
caller.<p>

The following function can be used to accept a  connection  on  a
socket  that  has  been  created  using  the establish() function
above:<p>
<pre>
  int get_connection(s)
  int s;                    /* socket created with establish() */
  { struct sockaddr_in isa; /* address of socket */
    int i;                  /* size of address */
    int t;                  /* socket of connection */

    i = sizeof(isa);                   /* find socket's address */
    getsockname(s,&amp;isa,&amp;i);            /* for accept() */

    if ((t = accept(s,&amp;isa,&amp;i)) &lt; 0)   /* accept connection if there is one */
      return(-1);
    return(t);
  }
</pre>
Unlike with the telephone,  you  may  still  accept  calls  while
processing  previous  connections.   For  this reason you usually
fork off jobs to handle  each  connection.   The  following  code
shows  how  to  use  establish()  and  get_connection()  to allow
multiple connections to be dealt with:<p>

<pre>
  #include &lt;errno.h&gt;       /* obligatory includes */
  #include &lt;signal.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
  #include &lt;sys/socket.h&gt;
  #include &lt;sys/wait.h&gt;
  #include &lt;netinet/in.h&gt;
  #include &lt;netdb.h&gt;

  #define PORTNUM 50000 /* random port number, we need something */

  void fireman(), do_something();

  main()
  { int s, t;

    if ((s= establish(PORTNUM)) &lt; 0) {  /* plug in the phone */
      perror("establish");
      exit(1);
    }

    signal(SIGCHLD, fireman);           /* this eliminates zombies */

    for (;;) {                          /* loop for phone calls */
      if ((t= get_connection(s)) &lt; 0) { /* get a connection */
        if (errno == EINTR)             /* EINTR might happen on accept(), */
          continue;                     /* try again */
        perror("accept");               /* bad */
        exit(1);
      }
      switch(fork()) {                  /* try to handle connection */
      case -1 :                         /* bad news.  scream and die */
        perror("fork");
        close(s);
        close(t);
        exit(1);
      case 0 :                          /* we're the child, do something */
        do_something(t);
        exit(0);
      default :                         /* we're the parent so look for */
        close(t);                       /* another connection */
        continue;
      }
    }
  }

  /* as children die we should get catch their returns or else we get
   * zombies, A Bad Thing.  fireman() catches falling children.
   */

  void fireman()
  { union wait wstatus;

    while(wait3(&amp;wstatus,WNOHANG,NULL) &gt; 0)
        ;
  }

  /* this is the function that plays with the socket.  it will be called
   * after getting a connection.
   */

  void do_something(s)
  int s;
  {
    /* do your thing with the socket here
        :
        :
     */
  }
</pre>

                   (or:  How to call a socket)<p>

You now know how to create a socket that will accept incoming calls.
So how do you call it?  As with the telephone, you must first have the
phone before using it to call.  You use the socket() function to do
this, exactly as you establish a socket to listen to.<p>

After getting a socket to make the call with, and giving it an address,
you use the <I>connect()</I> function to try to connect to a listening
socket.  The following function calls a particular port number on a
particular host:<p>

<pre>
  int call_socket(hostname, portnum)
  char *hostname;
  { struct sockaddr_in sa;
    struct hostent     *hp;
    int a, s;

    if ((hp= gethostbyname(hostname)) == NULL) { /* do we know the host's */
      errno= ECONNREFUSED;                       /* address? */
      return(-1);                                /* no */
    }

    bzero(&amp;sa,sizeof(sa));
    bcopy(hp-&gt;h_addr,(char *)&amp;sa.sin_addr,hp-&gt;h_length); /* set address */
    sa.sin_family= hp-&gt;h_addrtype;
    sa.sin_port= htons((u_short)portnum);

    if ((s= socket(hp-&gt;h_addrtype,SOCK_STREAM,0)) &lt; 0)   /* get socket */
      return(-1);
    if (connect(s,&amp;sa,sizeof sa) &lt; 0) {                  /* connect */
      close(s);
      return(-1);
    }
    return(s);
  }
</pre>

This function returns a connected socket through which  data  can
flow.<p>


<center> <B>Conversation</B><BR> (or:  How to talk between sockets)<p>
</center> Now that you have a connection between sockets you want  to 
send data  between them.  The <I>read()</I> and <I>write()</I>
functions are used to do this, just as they are for normal files. 
There  is  only  one major  difference  between  socket  reading  and
writing and file reading and writing:  you don't usually get back the
same  number of  characters  that you asked for, so you usually loop
until you have read the number of  characters  that  you  want.   A 
simple function to read a given number of characters into a buffer
is:<p>

<pre>
  int read_data(s,buf,n)
  int  s;                /* connected socket */
  char *buf;             /* pointer to the buffer */
  int  n;                /* number of characters (bytes) we want */
  { int bcount,          /* counts bytes read */
        br;              /* bytes read this pass */

    bcount= 0;
    br= 0;
    while (bcount &lt; n) {             /* loop until full buffer */
      if ((br= read(s,buf,n-bcount)) &gt; 0) {
        bcount += br;                /* increment byte counter */
        buf += br;                   /* move buffer ptr for next read */
      }
      if (br &lt; 0)                    /* signal an error to the caller */
        return(-1);
    }
    return(bcount);
  }
</pre>

A very similar function should be used to write  data;  we  leave
that function as an exercise to the reader.<p>


<center>
                           <B>Hanging Up</B><BR>
        (or:  What to do when you're done with a socket)<p>
</center>

Just as you hang up when you're through speaking to someone  over the 
telephone,  so  must you close a connection between sockets. The normal
<I>close()</I> function is used to close each end of a socket
connection.  If one end of a socket is closed and the other tries to
write to its end, the write will return an error.<p>


<center>
                      <B>Speaking The Language</B><BR>
                 (or:  Byte order is important)<p>
</center>

Now that you can talk between machines, you have  to  be  careful
what  you  say.   Many  machines  use differing dialects, such as
ASCII versus (yech) EBCDIC.  More commonly there  are  byte-order
problems.  Unless you always pass text, you'll run up against the
byte-order problem.  Luckily people have already figured out what
to do about it.<p>

Once upon a time in the dark  ages  someone  decided  which  byte order
was "right".  Now there exist functions that convert one to the other
if necessary.  Some  of  these  functions  are  <I>htons()</I> (host 
to  network short integer), <I>ntohs()</I> (network to host short
integer), <I>htoni()</I> (host to network integer), <I>ntohi()</I>
(network  to host  integer),  <I>htonl()</I>  (host  to  network  long 
integer), and <I>ntohl()</I> (network  to  host  long  integer).  
Before  sending  an integer  through  a  socket, you should first
massage it with the htoni() function:<p>

<pre>
  i= htoni(i);
  write_data(s, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
</pre>

and after reading data you should convert it back with <I>ntohi()</I>:<p>

<pre>
  read_data(s, &amp;i, sizeof(i));
  i= ntohi(i);
</pre>

If you keep in the habit of using these functions you'll be  less
likely  to  goof  it  up  in  those  circumstances  where  it  is
necessary.<p>

</center>

Using just what's been discussed here you should be able to build
your own programs that communicate with sockets.  As with all new
things, however, it would be  a  good  idea  to  look  at  what's
already  been done.  Many public domain programs exist which make
use of the socket concept, and many books  exist  which  go  into
much  more depth than I have here.  In addition I've deliberately
left out a lot of details such as what kinds  of  things  can  go
wrong;  the  manual  pages  for  each  of the functions should be
consulted for this information.<p>
