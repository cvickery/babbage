          The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

     $Date$
          The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.

     $Header$
          A standard header containing the full pathname  of  the
          RCS  file,  the  revision  number,  the date (UTC), the
          author, the state, and the locker (if locked).

     $Id$ Same as $Header$,  except  that  the  RCS  filename  is
          without a path.

     $Locker$
          The login name of the  user  who  locked  the  revision
          (empty if not locked).

          messages  are  not replaced.  Instead, the new log mes-
          sage is inserted after $Log:...$.  This is  useful  for
