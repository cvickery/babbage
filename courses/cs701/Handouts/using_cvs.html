<h1 align = center>Using CVS</h1>

CVS is the "Concurrent Versions System," a project management tool
which is available for free from <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org">www.cvshome.org</a>.  There are several
similar project management tools available commercially, but we use
this one because (1) it is good, (2) its basic features are very
similar to the commercial products available, (3) it is easy to use,
and (4) it is free.  CVS is also designed to absorb pre-existing RCS
(Revision Control System) projects, so for those users of RCS
(available from <a href="http://www.gnu.ai.met.edu/fsf/fsf.html">The
Free Software Foundation</a>), migration to CVS should be relatively
simple.<p>

There are three main advantages to using CVS over RCS.  First, CVS
allows for multi-directory projects, which RCS does not.  Second, CVS
allows for concurrent management of projects - in other words, multiple
programmers can work on the same project, and CVS will assist in
merging each programmer's work into the revisions of the others. 
Third, CVS allows for remote access to repositories, so you can make
your projects available to potential users and developers across the
Internet.<p>

There are two main features of CVS that we will use.  One is its
provision for maintaining a complete history of each document (source
code or documentation page) in your projects.  At any time you can
recover earlier versions of files almost as easily as you can work with
the current version.  The second feature is the facility that CVS
provides for documenting changes you make to your files as you develop
a project.  There are many more features that CVS can provide, but we
will not take advantage of them in this course.  If you want to learn
more, consult the <i>man</i> page for <i>cvs</i> and <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs.html">the Cederqvist</a>,
the main documentation for the CVS project. If you find the manual name
puzzling, or have other questions about CVS, you may also wish to
consult the official <a href="http://ccvs.cvshome.org/fom/fom.cgi">CVS
FAQ</a>.<p>

<h2>Setting Up the Repository</h2>

CVS requires a central repository directory for all projects it manages
on a local machine.  You can have multiple projects in a single
repository.  Once you create the repository, CVS' internal recordkeeping
is stored within that repository, but you can work on your projects
anywhere.<p>

To create the main CVS repository, first choose a directory on your
local machine.  A typical choice is <i>/usr/local/cvsroot</i>.  Assuming
that this is the directory you have chosen, you can initialize your
repository with the command:

<pre>
   $ cvs -d /usr/local/cvsroot init
</pre>

You should set the environment variable <code>CVSROOT</code> to point to
the CVS repository.  In C shell environments, this is achieved with the
command:<p>

<pre>
   $ setenv CVSROOT /usr/local/cvsroot
</pre>

while in BASH or KornShell environments, you would use:<p>

<pre>
   $ export CVSROOT=/usr/local/cvsroot
</pre>

You may wish to place these environment variable settings in a global
location such as <i>/etc/profile</i>, or in your local user
initialization scripts, so that they are always accessible.

<h2>Defining the Module</h2>

Because CVS can handle multiple projects within a single repository,
each project must be defined by a <i>module</i> to CVS' internal
recordkeeping.  Modules are usually defined as a project existant under
a single directory tree structure.  The first thing to do in creating
your project is to create a master directory, appropriately-named for
that project.  You will place all files related to that project in that
directory or its subdirectories, so that CVS can easily import the
entire directory tree.  In general, you should create the directories
you know you'll need first; for instance, if you are creating a project
called <i>project1</i>, you would create the following directories:<p>

<pre>
   $ mkdir project1
   $ mkdir project1/man
</pre>

After that, you would use the following commands to register these
directories inside the CVS repositories:

<pre>
   $ cd project1
   $ cvs import -m "Created directory structure" project1 yourname start
</pre>

The format of the <i>import</i> command is as follows:  the <i>-m</i>
directive provides a message that will be stored in CVS' logs,
specified by the string after the directive.  <i>project1</i> is the
directory under the CVSROOT in which the project will be stored.
<i>yourname</i> should be replaced by your name - this is the <i>vendor
tag</i> which specifies who has made the revisions; while the concept
of vendors won't be used in this course, CVS requires that you specify
one in the initial revision.  Finally, <i>start</i> tells CVS to
initialize the project within the repository.  <p>

The next step is to add the project to the CVS modules database, so
that CVS can identify the project with a simple project name.  To do
this, you must first get a working copy of the CVS modules file:

<pre>
   $ cvs checkout CVSROOT/modules
   $ cd CVSROOT
</pre>

Open the <code>modules</code> file in a text editor and add the
following at the bottom:

<pre>
   project1   project1
</pre>

The first <i>project1</i> specifies the <i>module name</i>, which you
will use to refer to the project.  The second refers to the directory
under the CVSROOT in which the file will be stored.<p>

After you have saved the file, you must commit the changes you have
made:

<pre>
   $ cvs commit -m "Added the project1 module." modules
</pre>

And finally, release the modules file.

<pre>
   $ cd ..
   $ cvs release -d CVSROOT
</pre>

The <i>checkout</i> command seen above is used to check a module out
from the repository - in other words, to obtain a copy for editing,
review, or compilation.  The <code>CVSROOT/modules</code> module seen
above is automatically provided by CVS; in the case of your project, you
will check out the <code>project1</code> module you created above using
the command:

<pre>
   $ cvs checkout project1
</pre>

The syntax of the <i>release</i> command is
discussed in more detail in the CVS documentation.

<h2>CVS Headers</h2>

Whenever you start a new programming project, create an
appropriately-named directory for that project.  You will place all
files related to that project in that directory or its subdirectories,
so that CVS can easily import the entire directory tree.  Each new
source file, whether it is a <code>.cc</code> or a header file, starts
like this:

<pre>
   // $Id$

   /* SUMMARY
    *
    *
    * REVISION HISTORY
    *  $Log$
    */
</pre>

The complete form of this <i>file header</i> is described in the <a
href="./coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</a> for this course.
Our attention here is on the <code>$Id$</code> and <code>$Log$</code>
lines, which must be written with exactly the capitalization and
punctuation shown here in order to work properly with CVS.  These are
examples of CVS <i>keywords</i> (sometimes called CVS <i>macros</i>)
which will be modified by CVS as you work on your project.  There is a
<a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_12.html#SEC99">list
of all CVS keywords</a> you can look at if you wish, but you only need
the two lines listed here for this course.  Note that these keywords
appear on comment lines.  If they were placed anywhere else the compiler
would recognize that they are not valid C or C++ code, and would produce
syntax errors.<p>

The other files that you will create for the projects in this course are
the <code>Makefile</code> that goes in each project directory, and the
<i>man</i> pages that you use to document your projects.  Comment lines
in Makefiles start with a hash symbol in column 1:

<pre>
   #  $Id$

   #  comments ...
   #
   #  $Log$
   #
</pre>

Comments in <i>man</i> pages start with dot-backslash-quote:

<pre>
   .\"  $Id$
   .\"
   .\"  comments ...
   .\"
   .\"  $Log$
   .\"
   .TH ...
</pre>

Once you are comfortable working with these two CVS keywords, you might
want to put some of the other keywords inside character strings so your
program can use them as data for one reason or another (such as
including the program's version number in the "About" message of a Help
window).  However, that topic goes beyond the scope of this document.
We will look at <code>$Id$</code> and <code>$Log$</code> again after
going over some basic CVS concepts.<p>

<h2>CVS Revisions</h2>

You write the first version of your program just as you would if you
weren't using CVS.  Use a text editor to create source files, compile
them, test the code, and iterate through this process until you have a
working program.  If the progam is simple, the development process might
be complete at this stage.  For other programs, the first working
program might be just the first step of a multi-step assignment.  In
either case, you are now ready to put the source files under CVS
management.  When you are adding a new source file to the repository,
this is a two-step process; afterwards you will be able to check in your
modifications with a single CVS command.<p>

After you have created a new file or directory inside the project tree,
enter the following command from the directory in which the new file or
directory resides:

<pre>
   $ cvs add filename
</pre>

This will inform CVS to watch the file and prepare to add it to the
repository.  You can <i>add</i> as many files as you like before you
<i>commit</i> the changes; if you change your mind about adding the
file, you can issue the command

<pre>
   $ cvs remove filename
</pre>

before you <i>commit</i>, and the file will be removed from the list of
watched files.  After adding the file, you <i>commit</i> it:

<pre>
   $ cvs commit filename
</pre>

This copies the file into the CVS repository for the project.  What this
really means is that the file, along with some additional information,
will be copied into the CVS subdirectory and given a new name, which
will consist of the original file name with ",v" at the end.  You can
list the contents of the CVS subdirectory to verify this.  Do a long
listing, and you will also notice that the database file (also called
the "history" file) is made read-only.  From now on you can make changes
to the file only by telling CVS that you want to do so.  You could
change permissions on the history file and change its contents manually,
but don't.  Really don't.<p>

When you commit the changes, you must provide a message that will be
stored in the history file, providing you with a continuous log of
modifications made to the file.  This message should be a short summary
of just what it is that makes this version of the file different from
the previous version.  If you fixed a bug, tell what the bug was.  If
you added a new feature, tell what the feature does.  If you changed
comments, tell what kind of changes you made.  The log message does not
have to be long, but it must be concrete and meaningful, not vague.<p>

You have two options as to how to
provide this message.  If you use the <i>cvs commit filename</i> command
above, CVS will attempt to open an editor - specified by the environment
variable EDITOR.  $EDITOR usually points to vi, but you can change the
environment variable to select another editor.  Alternatively, you can
specify a short message directly at the command line using the <i>-m</i>
directive seen above:

<pre>
   $ cvs commit -m "Made some minor spelling corrections." filename
</pre>

A file need only be added to the repository once; once that is done, you
report changes by using the <i>commit</i> command.  So from now on,
after editing the file, be sure to issue <i>cvs commit filename</i> to
copy those changes into the CVS repository and make them publically
available.  This gives you the benefit of having a <i>stable</i> copy of
a source file and a <i>working</i> copy - while the CVS repository may
only contain code that you want to make public, you can carry around the
working copy and make as many changes as you wish, finally only
committing them when you are certain that the code works well.<p>

As another option, you can issue the <i>cvs commit</i> directive in a
directory without the <i>filename</i> to commit all of the files in that directory that have been
edited.  However, as a rule, it's best to commit the files one at a time
so that you can keep track of which files have been changed.

<h2>Versioning and Tags</h2>

At this point you have entered version 1.1 of each of your source files
into the CVS repository.  Each time you add a file, it will be added
into the repository as version 1.1; each time you modify a version and
commit it to the repository, the version number will be incremented.
You should not be alarmed that CVS keeps different version numbers for
each file in a project - treat the revision numbers as internal
recordkeeping numbers for CVS, and not as any meaningful 'release
version' for your own use.<p>

If for some reason you want to bring all of your files up to a certain
revision number, you can use the <i>-r</i> option - for instance

<pre>
   $ cvs commit -r 3.0
</pre>

will bring all of the files in the repository - including those you
haven't edited - up to version 3.0.  Correspondingly, you can use
<i>-r</i> to retrieve a specific version of a file.  If the file
<code>foobar.cc</code> is currently at version 3.0, and you decide that
you want to re-examine revision 1.2, the command

<pre>
   $ cvs checkout -r 1.2 foobar.cc
</pre>

will check out the required version.<p>

However, since revision numbers are usually not used for this purpose,
and are difficult to keep aligned, CVS includes support for
<i>tagging</i>.  You can use tags to mark a milestone release of a
project without bringing all of the version numbers in synch.  To apply
a tag, enter the base directory of your checked-out project, and use the
<i>tag</i> directive to apply a tag name to the current version of your
project.  For instance, if you wanted to label the current release of
your project <code>rel-1-0</code>, you would issue the command:

<pre>
   $ cvs tag rel-1-0
</pre>

This tag will be applied to all of the current versions of the source
files; after later revisions, if you wanted to return and check out
<code>rel-1-0</code> of your project, you could use the <i>-r</i>
directive:

<pre>
   $ cvs checkout -r rel-1-0 project1
</pre>

<h2>Keywords Again</h2>

Once a file is under CVS management, you will see that checking it out
gives you a file in which the keywords have been expanded.  The
<code>$Id$</code> keyword will tell you the name of the file, its
version number, who last modified it, and when.  We put this keyword on
the first line of the file so this basic summary information is always
the first thing anyone sees when they first look at the file.  The
<code>$Log$</code> keyword will be expanded to give the complete
modification history of the file, that is, comment lines from all the
log messages you entered when checking in revised copies of the file
along with the revision dates and numbers.  Be sure these log messages
provide useful information for programmers who might need to work on a
file after you.<p>

<h2>Multiple Developers</h2>

The primary difference between RCS and CVS is in the way the two systems
handle multi-developer projects.  RCS uses <i>file locking</i> or
<i>reserved checkouts</i>; in this system the first developer to want to
edit a file checks out (or <i>reserves</i>) a copy of the source file.
Once that copy is reserved, no other developer can get a copy for
editing, although they can check out a copy for examination or
compilation.  Only a reserved checkout can be checked back into the
repository with modifications.<p>

CVS provides support for reserved checkouts using the <i>-l</i> flag.
To lock a file or branch, issue the command:

<pre>
   $ cvs admin -l
</pre>

Conversely, you can unlock the file or branch with the <i>-u</i> flag:

<pre>
   $ cvs admin -u
</pre>

However, file locking is considered a primitive method of revision
control, and CVS was chiefly designed to provide a more sophisticated
paradigm for multi-developer programming.  The Cederqvist contains CVS'
rationale for supporting newer methods in the section <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org/docs/manual/cvs_10.html#SEC95">Choosing
Between Reserved or Unreserved Checkouts</a>; this material is too
detailed to cover here.  In CVS' model, multiple developers can check
out, edit, and commit their changes to a source file.  The first
developer to check the file back in knows nothing about the subsequent
developers; however the later developers are required to integrate their
changes on check-in.  The CVS documentation covers this topic in far
greater detail.

<h2>CVS Documentation</h2>

The chief documentation on CVS is found in the <i>man</i> page and at
the main CVS webpage, at <a
href="http://www.cvshome.org">www.cvshome.org</a>.  There is a pocket
reference book for CVS commands:
