<h1>Using Java on Dijkstra</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This page summarizes the information you need for building Java
applications on Dijkstra.  It may or may not remain relevant after the
Spring 2003 semester.</p>

<h2>Installed Software</h2>

<p>Version 1.4.1 of Sun's Software Development Kit for Java is
installed in /usr/local/j2sdk1.4.1_01.  To avoid having to change setup
parameters every time I install a new version, there is a symbolic link
from that directory to /usr/local/java.</p>

<p>The SDK commands related to Java (javac, java, javah, javadoc, etc.)
are in /usr/local/java/bin, so that directory must be in your PATH in
order to use them.</p>

<p>IBM's speedy Jikes compiler (<i>jikes</i>) is in /usr/local/bin, a
common place to put locally-installed software (as opposed to the
programs that are installed with the SuSE Linux distribution), so you
need to be sure that directory is in your PATH too.</p>

<p>The jikes compiler uses the environment variable JIKESPATH to locate
the standard class libraries that are used by Java programs.  This
variable has to be set to /usr/local/java/jre/lib/rt.jar for the jikes
compiler to work.  (In class I erroneously named this variable
"JIKES_HOME" instead of "JIKESPATH.")</p>

<p class="indent">A nice feature of the jikes compiler comes when you
invoke it with the "++" command line option.  For example, the command,
<i>jikes&nbsp;++&nbsp;*.java</i> will compile all .java files in the
current directory, but the compiler will not exit.  Instead, it will
prompt you to press Enter when you want to compile your .java files
again.  Like <i>make</i>, jikes is smart and will recompile only those
.java files that have changed since the last compilation.  If you log
into Dijkstra from two different windows, you can set the jikes compiler
running in one window while you edit and test your code in another
one.</p>

<p>To use JNI, you need to #include the jni.h header file in your .cc
program.  Furthermore, jni.h #includes jni_md.h, so you need to tell
the g++ compiler driver what directories to search for these two header
files using the "-I" command line option.  You can do this using
<i>make</i> by setting CXXFLAGS as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">
CXXFLAGS = -g -Wall =Wwrite-strings -I/usr/local/java/include \
<br>-I/usr/local/java/linux</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>To use JNI, your C++ functions have to be in a shared library.  In
order for the Java VM to load a library ( <i>System.loadLibrary()</i>
), the directory containing the library has to be part of the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which, like PATH, is a colon-separated list of
directories.  If the library file is in the current directory, you can
just put . in the value of this variable.  For example, here's a rule
from a Makefile that could be used to run the "HelloWorld" sample
program from the JNI tutorial at Sun:</p>

<p class="indent">

run : libhello.so HelloWorld.class
<br>&lt;tab&gt;LD_LIBRARY_PATH=.:$(LD_LIBRARY_PATH) java HelloWorld</p>

<p>This rule uses a feature of the shell that lets you set the value of
an environment variable just for the execution of a single command; once
the command completes, the variable returns to its original value. 
There is nothing that says the rule would have to be written this way,
but the example gives you a chance to see another way to use environment
variables.</p>
