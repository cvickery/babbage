<h1 align=center>How to Write a Man Page</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  In order to write your man pages so that they can be viewed properly
  using the <i>man(1)</i> command, they have to be formatted in a
  particular way.  This handout will tell you enough so you can write
  professional-looking man pages, but it isn't at all complete.  For
  more information, see both <i>man(1)</i> and <i>man(5)</i> or
  <i>man(7)</i>.  The <i>man</i> page for <i>man</i> in Section 1 has
  information on how to use the <i>man</i> command, while Section 5 or
  7 has a page on how to write <i>man</i> pages, and was the source of
  information for this document.  (On Solaris and OSF1, used on
  forbin, the information on writing man pages is in section 5, but on
  at least some Linux systems, it's in section 7.)


<h2>Background</h2>

  There are two things you need to understand to get started.  The
  first is how to get <i>man(1)</i> to find your man page, and the
  second is the basic idea of text processing on Unix systems.

<h3>Finding man Pages</h3>

  The <i>man(1)</i> command searches a set of directories listed in the
  MANPATH environment variable for subdirectories of the form "manX,"
  where X is a manual section number.  Thus, all the man pages for
  commands are in directories named man1, all the man pages for system
  calls are in directories named man2, etc. The man pages themselves
  have names of the form "name.X" where name is the name of the
  command, system call, or whatever, and "X" is usually the manual
  section number. Thus, if the directory /usr/man is listed in the
  MANPATH environment variable, the man page for the <i>ls</i> command
  might be <code>/usr/man/man1/ls.1</code>.<p>

  The <code>-M</code> option of the <i>man</i> command can be used to
  specify a directory to be searched instead of using the MANPATH.
  The <code>-M</code> option is especially useful for testing a new
  man page you are writing.  For example, you could create the
  subdirectories man, man/man1, and man/man3 in a project directory
  and put the man page for a new command in man/man1/xxx.1 and the man
  page for a new library function in man/man3/yyy.3.  Then, from the
  project directory the command "man&nbsp;-M&nbsp;./man&nbsp;xxx"
  would display the man page for your xxx command and the command
  "man&nbsp;-M&nbsp;./man&nbsp;yyy" would display the man page for
  your yyy library function.  (Not all projects for this course
  involve writing both commands and library functions; write just the
  pages that are assigned.)<p>

  Man pages are text files, and whatever you put in them will be
  displayed by the <i>man</i> command.  But to get them to look like
  "real" man pages, they have to be written in a special way, which
  brings us to the next topic: Text Processing on Unix systems.

<h3>Unix Text Processing</h3>

  If Unix was being invented now, <i>man</i> pages would probably be
  written using HTML, the Hypertext Mark-up Language for World Wide Web
  pages.  But Unix was invented long before HTML (or SGML, on which
  HTML is based) was developed, and man pages are written using a
  different <i>markup language</i> entirely.<p>

  There are many programs that perform text formatting on Unix
  systems.  Most operate as <i>filters</i> that read ASCII characters
  from <i>stdin</i>, modify the text layout, and write formatted text
  to <i>stdout</i>.  The <i>man(1)</i> command itself sets up a
  pipeline to pass an ASCII man page (such as <code>xxx.1</code>)
  through a series of these filters, which do such things as format
  paragraphs to fit on the page properly, indent headings and
  sub-headings properly, and even to do such things as formatting
  tables and equations that might be embedded in the document.  The
  crucial point is that the final appearance of a page is controlled by
  commands that are embedded in your text file, not by the way you type
  the original text.  For example, a basic command is ".P" which marks
  the beginning of a paragraph.  (All commands start with a dot in the
  first column of a line.) Once you type a .P command, whatever you
  type, until the next command, will be formatted into a nice paragraph
  with standard margins and spacing.  You can type each word of the
  paragraph on a separate line or 100 words per line, and the paragraph
  will end up looking the same way.  The only way you can mess up the
  format of a paragraph is to type extra blanks, which don't get
  squeezed out for you.<p>

	There is a special set of text formatting commands that you use
	to write <i>man</i> pages.  You can use others as well, but the
	following list is all you need.


<h2>Commands for Formatting <i>man</i> Pages</h2>

<dl>

<dt><code>.\"</code> <i>text</i>

  <dd>This is how you put comments in a <i>man</i> page.  The text,
  <i>text</i>, is not seen by the person using <i>man</i> to read the
  page.  The backslash (<code>\</code>) is an escape character that
  tells parts of the <i>man</i> system to treat the next character as a
  literal rather than as the beginning of a quoted string.  Any time
  you have trouble putting a special character in a <i>man</i> page,
  you should try preceding it with a backslash.<p>

  To adhere to the <a href="./coding_guidelines.html">Coding
  Guidelines</a> for this course, you must document your man pages just
  as you document your source code. The first few lines of your man
  pages will start with something like this, assuming you are using RCS
  to manage the versions of your project:

<pre>
    .\"   $Id$
    .\"
    .\"   Man page for the xyz project.
    .\"
    .\"   $Log$
    .\"
</pre>

<dt><code>.TH</code> <i>name section center-footer left-footer center-header</i>

  <dd>This command normally goes on the first line after the initial
  block of comments of a man page file; it is used to set the title,
  header, and footer lines.  The strings following <code>.TH</code>
  are used for the following information:<p>

  <dl>
  <dt><i>name</i><dd>The name of the command or function.
  <dt><i>section</i><dd>The section of the manual. (1 for commands, etc.)
  <dt><i>center-footer</i><dd>The date the man page was last modified.
  Some systems do not display footers when you use the man command
  interactively, only when printing the pages.
  <dt><i>left-footer</i><dd>Bottom left footer.  See Below
  <dt><i>center-header</i><dd>The main page (center) heading.  See
  below.
  </dl><p>

Use quotes if any of these fields contains embedded blanks.  Use
"CS-701" as the left-footer for the <i>man</i> pages you write for this
course. The main page (center) heading gives the place or organization
where the software being documented originated; we'll use "Queens
College."<p>

Here is an example:

<blockquote>
.TH mycommand 1 "December 2001" "CS-701" "Queens College"

</blockquote>

<dt><code>.SH</code> <i>t</i>

<dd>This command creates a section heading.  The string <i>t</i> will
appear at the left margin.  The conventional section headings are NAME,
SYNOPSIS, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, DIAGNOSTICS, and BUGS in that order.
Look at existing <i>man</i> pages for the type of information to put in
each section.  The Section 5 or 7 <i>man</i> page for <i>man</i> gives
guidelines too.<p>

For projects that are done as a sequence of steps, add another section
heading, VERSION, with the RCS <code>$Revision$</code> keyword as the
section body.

<dt><code>.SS</code> <i>t</i>

<dd>This command creates a sub-heading.  It will be indented 5 spaces
from the left margin.  You usually capitalize just the first letter in
the words of a sub-heading.

<dt><code>.P</code>

<dd>Start a new paragraph.  You start the text on the next line after
the .P command.  Note: You must type each line of the paragraph
starting in column 1 for .P to work.  If you indent any lines yourself,
.P will display the line as you typed it.  Also, the .TH command must
be present for the paragraph margins to be set properly.

<dt><code>.HP</code>

<dd>Start a paragraph with a hanging indent.  If the paragraph is more
than one line long, the second and succeeding lines will be indented 5
spaces more than the first line.

<dt><code>.RS</code>
<dt><code>.RE</code>

<dd>Start and end a nested indentation.  If the current indent is 5,
the .RS will make it 10.  If the current indent is 10, .RS will make it
15, etc.

<dt><code>.I</code> <i>t</i>

<dd>Italics (underline) text.  If you want to italicize just one word,
omit <i>t</i> from the .I command line, and type the word on the next
line.  For example:

<pre>
.P
This is a sentence in which the word
.I
word
is italicized.  Note that using .I does not affect the paragraph
formatting.
</pre>

Would be output something like this:
<pre>
     This is a  sentence in which the word <i>word</i> is
     italicized.  Note that using .I does not affect
     the paragraph formatting.
</pre>


<dt><code>.B</code> <i>t</i>

<dd>Like .I, but for boldface text.  Often shows up as reverse video or
color on CRTs.

</dl>

<h3>Summary</h3>

That's it.  All you really need are .\", .TH, .SS, and .P to produce
"real" <i>man</i> pages for this course.  Anything else is icing on the
cake.
