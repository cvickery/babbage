<h1>Using <i>make</i></h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>


The <i>make</i> command invokes a project management tool that uses
<i>rules</i> to determine what <i>commands</i> need to be executed in
order to build <i>targets</i> based on <i>dependencies</i>.  Each of
the italicized terms in this paragraph will be explained in this
web page.<p>

The <i>make</i> utility is used in virtually all software development
environments, including UNIX, Windows, and other operating systems. 
The program might be named <i>make</i>, <i>nmake</i>, <i>mk</i>, or
<i>gmake</i>, or might be buried behind the "Build" button of an IDE
(Integrated Development Environment), but it is virtually always
there.<p>

This web page introduces some basic concepts common to most
implementations of <i>make</i>, but many of the details here are
specific to the version used in our lab, which comes from the GNU
project at MIT. There is a <a href="#references">Documentation and
References</a> section below that you can consult for more information
than what is given here.<p>

The basic idea of <i>make</i> is that it can be used to automate common
tasks efficiently.  The tasks you automate almost always involve
manipulating <i>files</i> by issuing <i>commands</i>.  (The <i>make</i>
utility is so general that just about every statement about it has to
be qualified with phrases like "almost always," "usually," or
"normally."  In the interest of simplicity, I'll skip some of those
qualifiers in what follows.)

<h2>The <i>make</i> Command Line</h2>

You can invoke the <i>make</i> processor just by typing the name of the
command with no command line options, but in this case, there must be a
Makefile in the current directory to tell <i>make</i> what to do.  If
there is no Makefile, but there is a subdirectory named RCS,
<i>make</i> will attempt to check out its Makefile using the RCS
<i>co</i> command.  There is a web
page, <a href="./using_rcs.html">Using RCS</a>, available for further
information on using RCS.  All but the simplest tasks (such as compiling a
single source file into an executable file) require the use of a
Makefile, and this web page is intended to help you write your own
Makefiles.  To help get you started, there is a <a
href="./skeleton_makefile.html">Skeleton Makefile</a> that you can use
to get you started.  You might want to have a copy of that web page
available to look at as you read this one.<p>

Often, you supply one or more <i>targets</i> on the command line, which
tell <i>make</i> what it is you want it to make.  Targets are described
below.<p>

To the right of the <i>make</i> command name and to the left of any
targets you might specify on the command line, you may also provide
values for <i>make</i> "macros", using <code>name=value</code> syntax. 
(Macros are also called <i>make</i> <u>variables</u>), and are
described in more detail <a href="#macros">below</a>.<p>

For example, if you want <i>make</i> to use "-r1.3" for the value of
its COFLAGS macro when making the target named "myprog," you could use
the following <i>make</i> command line:

<pre>
      make COFLAGS="-r1.3" myprog
</pre>

<h2>Implicit Rules</h2>

There are a lot of things that <i>make</i> knows how to do completely
automatically by following a set of built-in <i>implicit rules</i>. 
Other tasks have to be specified by <i>explicit rules</i> written by
the user.<p>

Most of <i>make</i>'s implicit rules are based on filename <i>pattern
matching</i>.  For example, GNU <i>make</i> knows how to do the following file
operations using its pattern matching rules:<p>

<ul>

  <li>Compile and link a file with an extension of <code>.cc</code> or
  <code>.c</code> to produce an executable file with the same basename
  as the <code>.cc</code> or <code>.c</code> file.

  <li>Compile a <code>.cc</code> or <code>.c</code> file to produce the
  corresponding <code>.o</code> file.

  <li>Obtain a copy of any file by checking it out of an RCS or SCCS
  database.
  
  <li>Link one or more .o files to produce an executable file.

</ul>

Since <i>make</i> knows how to do all these things automatically, they
should never be specified in explicit rules.  If you were to use explict
rules for any of these operations, (1) other people looking at your
rules would be confused, and (2) you might make a mistake that could be
avoided by using the implicit rules, which have been very carefully
designed and tested.<p>

There is a <a href = "./make_implicit_rules.html">web page with a fuller
description of these implicit rules </a>.  There is also information
about the the implicit rule for linking <a
href="#implicit_link">below</a>.  You can find the complete list of
implicit rules that GNU <i>make</i> knows about in the <i>info</i>
pages or <i>make</i> manual, referenced in the<a
href="#references">Documentation and References</a> section below.

<h2>Explicit Rules</h2>

Explicit Rules are typed into a file named <code>Makefile</code> in the
current directory.  Makefiles may contain comments (beginning with a
'#' character) and macro (variable) definitions as well as Explicit
Rules.<p>

An explicit rule has the following format:

<pre>
      &lt;target&gt; : [&lt;dependency list&gt;]
      [&lt;command list&gt;]
</pre>

The <i>&lt;target&gt;</i> is usually the name of a file that you want
<i>make</i> to build, but it can be a "phony" name that is used just to
get <i>make</i> to execute some commands for you.  You can specify the
rules that you want <i>make</i> to process by listing the target parts
of those rules on the <i>make</i> command line, but if you don't give
any targets on the command line, <i>make</i> will process the first
rule it finds in the Makefile.  If there is no Makefile in the current
directory (even after <i>make</i> tries its implicit rule for obtaining
it from an RCS or SCCS database), you must give a target on the
<i>make</i> command line, and <i>make</i> will try to build the target
using only its implicit rules.<p>

The first thing <i>make</i> does once it has selected a rule to process
is to use implicit or explicit rules to bring all the files listed in
the <i>&lt;dependency list&gt;</i> "up to date."  Once all the files in
the dependency list are up to date (see below), <i>make</i> executes
each of the commands in the <i>&lt;command list&gt;</i> for the rule. 
If the dependency list is empty, <i>make</i> executes the command list
for the rule unconditionally.<p>

In order to be "up to date" a file must be present, and it must have
been modified more recently than any files on its own dependency list. 
A common example of this that you will encounter is when <i>make</i>
uses one of its implicit rules to build a <code>.o</code> file from the
corresponding <code>.cc</code> file: the target (the <code>.o</code>
file) must have a more recent modification time than the file it
depends on (the corresponding <code>.cc</code> file).  If it doesn't,
it means that you have edited the <code>.cc</code> file since it was last
compiled, so <i>make</i> automatically executes a <i>g++</i> command to
compile the <code>.cc</code> file with the <code>-c</code> command line
option.<p>

Once all the files in the dependency list for a rule are up to date,
<i>make</i> executes each command in the command list, if there are
any. It doesn't matter if the commands actually build a file with the
same name as the target, they just get executed.<p>

<a name="implicit_link"><b>Note on Implicit Linking.</b></a>  Normally,
no commands get executed unless a rule includes at least one command in
its command list, but there is an important exception to this:  If rule
consists of just a target with a list of .o files for its dependencies,
<i>make</i> will bring all the .o files up to date using its implicit
rules for compilation, and then will use another implicit rule to link
all the .o files together to produce an executable file with the same
name as the target.  One of the .o files in the dependency list must
have the same basename as the target for this rule to work.  By the
time you are finished with this web page, you should see that the line,

<pre>
    $(EXEC) : $(OBJS)
</pre>

in the <a href="./skeleton_makefile.html">Skeleton Makefile</a> is an
example of how this implicit rule can be used.<p>

There is a syntax rule that says that each command in the command list
has to start with a <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> character, so that
<i>make</i> can tell where the list ends (by coming to a line that does
not start with a <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>).  If a command is too long
to fit one one line, it can be continued by putting a '\' character at
the end of lines that are to be continued.  Commands that are continued
have to start with a <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> on the first line, but
any additional lines don't have to have one.<p>

<B>Note:</B> Every command that <i>make</i> executes, whether because
of an explicit or implicit rule, is executed by its own shell, which is
the Bourne shell (<i>sh</i>) by default.  One implication of this is
that features that are specific to <i>csh</i> or <i>tcsh</i> (like
'<code>~/</code>' representing your home directory) won't work in the
commands in a rule's command list.  Also, setting an environment
variable in one command will have no effect during successive commands
because each invocation of a shell maintains its own environment list. 
You can <i>use</i> environment variables that were already set when
<i>make</i> was started, though, (like <code>$HOME</code> to represent
your home directory), but you have to make them look like <i>make</i>
macros, which will be covered in the next section.<p>

<B>Summary:</B>  Every rule has a target and either a dependency list or
a command list (or both).  A missing dependency list means to execute
the command list unconditionally.  For example, this rule causes the
command, "make clean" to delete files that have been checked out of RCS
without being locked, and then to remove some unwanted files:

<pre>
      clean :
      <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> rcsclean
      <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> rm core *.o *.bak
</pre>

<table width = 80% border=0 align=center><tr><td> (<i>The name "clean"
is conventionally used as the target for the rule in a Makefile that
removes all files from the project directory that can be regenerated
either by checking them out of the RCS database or by rebuilding them
using <i>make</i> rules.  See the <a
href="./skeleton_makefile.html">Skeleton Makefile</a> web page for the
definition of this and other "standard" rules.)</i></table><p>

A missing command list means that bringing the dependencies up to date
is all the user wants to do.  For example, the rule below causes
<i>make</i> to process the rule with "depend" as its target (another
"standard" rule), and then to build "myprog" (perhaps by using an
implicit rule to compile and link <code>myprog.cc</code>, or perhaps by
executing an explict rule for "myprog" that appears elsewhere in the
Makefile):

<pre>
      all : depend myprog
</pre>

(The name "all" is conventionally used as the target for the rule
in a Makefile that names all the other targets except "clean.")

<a name="macros"><h2>Macros (<i>make</i> Variables)</h2></a>

Strictly speaking you can write a Makefile that doesn't use any macros,
but the <a href="./skeleton_makefile.html">Skeleton Makefile</a> uses
several of them, and the <i>make</i> command itself uses some of them
for its implicit rules. Knowing how to use them yourself can help you
construct more flexible Makefiles than you can without them.<p>

A macro is just the name of a string.  Wherever <i>make</i> finds a
reference to a macro, which consists of a dollar sign followed by the
macro name in parantheses, it substitutes the string for the reference
to the name. Here are examples of a macro definition and a macro
reference from a Makefile:

<pre>
      MYFLAGS = These words are the value of the macro named "MYFLAGS"
      
      default :
      &lt;tab&gt; echo $(MYFLAGS)
</pre> 

Now, the command "make default" generates this output:

<pre>
      % make default
      echo These words are the value of the macro named "MYFLAGS"
      These words are the value of the macro named MYFLAGS
</pre>

The first output line is displayed by <i>make</i> as it shows you the
command it is going to execute, and the second output line is the result
of executing the <i>echo</i> command.<p>

(The name "default" is conventionally used as the target for the first
rule in a Makefile, so the commands "make default" and just plain "make"
will have the same effect.)<p>
 
You can define a macro in the Makefile as in the previous example, on
the <i>make</i> command line, or by setting an environment variable. 
Defining a macro on the command line overrides both the other two
methods:

<pre>
      % setenv MYFLAGS good-bye
      % make MYFLAGS=hello default
      echo hello
      hello
</pre>

Normally, defining a macro in the Makefile overrides defining an
environment variable, but this can be reversed with the <code>-e</code>
option on the <i>make</i> command line:

<pre>
      % make -e default
      echo good-bye
      goodbye
      % make default
      echo These words are the value of the macro named "MYFLAGS"
      These words are the value of the macro named MYFLAGS
</pre>

It is perfectly all right to reference a <i>make</i> macro that isn't
defined anywhere.  In this case, <i>make</i> will silently substitute an
empty string for the reference.<p>

<h2>Macros Used for Implicit Rules</h2>

There are lots of these, but here are the ones you need to know about
for this course:<p>

<table align=center border=0>

  <tr><td align=left><code>CXXFLAGS</code>
      <td align=left>Used for <i>g++</i> commands

  <tr><td align=left><code>CFLAGS</code>
      <td align=left>Used for <i>gcc</i> commands

  <tr><td align=left><code>COFLAGS</code>
      <td align=left>Used for RCS <i>co</i> commands

  <tr><td align=left><code>LDFLAGS</code>
      <td align=left>Used for <i>g++</i> or <i>gcc</i> commands that
      involve linking, normally to specify linker options.

  <tr><td align=left><code>LDLIBS</code> or <code>LOADLIBES</code>
      <td align=left>Used for <i>g++</i> or <i>gcc</i> commands that
      involve linking, normally to specify library names.

</table><p>

<B>NOTE:</B>  <i>Make</i> also uses macros to name the commands that it
generates for its implicit rules.  In particular, it uses the same
macro name, <code>CC</code>, in its implict rules for  compiling
<code>.c</code> files and in its implict rule for linking
<code>.o</code> files.  This macro name is different from
<code>CXX</code>, which is used in its implicit rule for compiling
<code>.cc</code> files.  This convention "works" because the <i>gcc</i>
and <i>g++</i> compiler drivers both use the same linker (<i>ld</i>)
when linking <code>.o</code> files.<p>

Thus, in the <a href="./skeleton_makefile.html">Skeleton Makefile</a>
the rule,

<pre>
    $(EXEC) : $(OBJS)
</pre>

says to be sure all the .o files are "up to date," which will cause
<i>make</i> to using its implicit rules for compiling .cc files (and/or
.c files) into .o files.  It will generate the appropriate compiler
driver command, <i>gcc</i> or <i>g++</i> for each file it has to
compile, based on whether the source file name ends with .c or .cc
respectively.  Then, regardless of what compiler driver was used to
produce the .o files, <i>make</i> will use its single implicit rule for
linking .o files to generate a <i>gcc</i> command to produce the
executable file.<p>

<h2>Suffix Substitution.</h2>

Let's say you need a list of <code>.o</code> files that will be used in
a rule that links the files into an executable file, and that you also
need a list of the corresponding <code>.cc</code> files that will be
passed to a <i>makedepend</i> command.  If you generate one list from
the other, you eliminate the chance that the two lists will get out of
sync with each other.  Here is an example that shows how to do it:

<pre>
      MY_SRCS = my_main.cc my_sub1.cc my_sub2.cc
      MY_SRCS = $(MY_OBJS:.cc=.o)
</pre>

In this example, <code>MY_OBJS</code> is derived from
<code>MY_SRCS</code> by substituting the suffix <code>.o</code> for all
occurrences of the suffix <code>.cc</code>.  Later, both lists can be
updated by editing just the definition of <code>MY_SRCS</code>. 
<i>Note: there must be no spaces inside the parentheses.</i>

<h2><a name="references">Documentation and Reference Material</a></h2>

There is a web page with a <a
href="./make_implicit_rules.html">Catalogue of <i>make</i>'s Implicit
Rules</a> on this web site.<p>

There is a <i>man</i> page for <i>make</i> availalable on any Unix system
with <i>make</i> installed on it, but the most complete
documentation is in GNU's <a name="info"><i>info</i></a> format.  Type
"info make" to get started on that.  Unfortunately, <i>info</i> is hard
to get used to.  It does web-like hypertext without a mouse.<p>

There is also a full manual on GNU <i>make</i> that contains all the
information you can get from <i>info</i>.  There is an HTML version of
the manual available from <a
href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/Manuals/">ftp.gnu.org</a>, and there is
a PDF version of it <a href="./make_manual.pdf">here</a>.<p>

There is a small book on <i>make</i> called "Managing Projects with
<i>make</i>, Second Edition", written by Andrew Oram and Steve Talbott,
and published by <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/make2/">O'Reilly and
Associates</a>.  It's highly recommended for a good survey of the
features available in the various implementations of <i>make</i> that
are available.
