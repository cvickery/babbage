<h1>RCS Keywords</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The following is a list of various RCS Keywords (macros) that can be
placed in text files, and a description of how they are expanded when
the file is checked out.<p>

For our course, the <b>$Id$</b> macro is to appear in a single-line
comment as the first line of each Makefile, <i>man</i> page, or source
file that you write.  The <b>$Log$</b> macro is to appear in the file
summary comment block of each Makefile and source file.<p>

These keywords can also appear in object modules and executable files by
embedding them in string literals.  For example:

<pre>
  static const char *Version = "$Revision$";
</pre>

The <i>ident</i> command will display RCS macros that have been embedded
in binary files in this manner.  (The <i>strings</i> command will show
all strings found in a binary file, including both RCS macros and other
string literals.)<p>

<h2>The Keywords</h2>

<pre>
     <b>$Author$</b>
          The login name of the user who checked in the revision.

     <b>$Date$</b>
          The date and time (UTC) the revision was checked in.
</pre>

<table align=center width=70% border=1 cellpadding=5><tr><td>
          <i>Note: UTC is not the same as your local time of day.  See 
          "<a href="http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/utc.html">What is
          UTC?</a>" for more information.  By using UTC, people around
          the world can work on a project and not have to deal with
          time zones.
</table><p>

<pre>
     <b>$Header$</b>
          A standard header containing the full pathname  of  the
          RCS  file,  the  revision  number,  the date (UTC), the
          author, the state, and the locker (if locked).

     <b>$Id$</b> Same as <i>$Header$</i>,  except  that  the  RCS 
          filename  is without a path.

     <b>$Locker$</b>
          The login name of the  user  who  locked  the  revision
          (empty if not locked).

     <b>$Log$</b>
          The log message supplied during checkin, preceded by  a
          header   containing  the  RCS  filename,  the  revision
          number, the author, and the date (UTC).   Existing  log
          messages  are  not replaced.  Instead, the new log mes-
          sage is inserted after $Log:...$.  This is  useful  for
          accumulating a complete change log in a source file.

     <b>$RCSfile$</b>
          The name of the RCS file without a path.

     <b>$Revision$</b>
          The revision number assigned to the revision.

     <b>$Source$</b>
          The full pathname of the RCS file.

     <b>$State$</b>
          The state assigned to the revision with the -s option
          of <i>rcs(1)</i> or <i>ci(1)</i>.
