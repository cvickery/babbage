<h1>Using RCS</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>RCS is the "Revision Control System," a project management tool
which is available for free from <a
href="http://www.gnu.ai.mit.edu/fsf/fsf.html">The Free Software
Foundation</a>.  There are several such tools available commercially,
but we use this one because (1) it is good, (2) it's basic features are
very similar to the commercial products available, (3) it is easy to
use, and (4) it is free.</p>

<p>There are two main features of RCS that we will use.  One is its
provision for maintaining a complete history of each document (source
code or documentation page) in your projects.  At any time you can
recover earlier versions of files almost as easily as you can work with
the current version.  The second feature is the facility that RCS
provides for documenting changes you make to your files as you develop
a project.  There are many more features that RCS can provide, but we
will not take advantage of them in this course.  If you want to learn
more, consult the <i>man</i> page for <i>rcs</i>.</p>

<H2>Setting Up a Project Directory</H2>

<p>Whenever you start a new programming project, create a new directory
to work in as you edit, compile, document,and debug the project. 
Create another directory under this directory named <code>RCS</code>
(this is a case-sensitive directory name).  Each new source file,
whether it is a <code>.cc</code> or a header file, starts like
this:</p>

<pre>
      //  $Id$

      /*  SUMMARY
       *
       *
       *  REVISION HISTORY
       *    $Log$
       */
</pre>

<p>The complete form of this <i>file header</i> is described in the <a
href="coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</a> for this course.
Our attention here is on the <code>$Id$</code> and <code>$Log$</code>
lines, which must be written with exactly the capitalization and
punctuatuation shown here in order to work properly with RCS.  These
are examples of RCS <i>keywords</i> (sometimes called RCS
<i>macros</i>) which will be modified by RCS as you work on your
project.  There is a <a href=
"http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/rcs_keywords.html">list
of all RCS keywords</a> you should look at, although you need to use
only the two mentioned above for this course.  Note that these keywords
must appear in comment lines.  If they were placed anywhere else the
compiler would recognize that they are not valid C or C++ code, and
would produce syntax errors.</p>

<p>The other files that you will create for the projects in this course
are the <code>Makefile</code> that goes in each project directory, and
the <I>man</I> pages that you use to document your projects.  Comment
lines in Makefiles start with a hash symbol in column 1:</p>

<pre>
      #   $Id$
      
      #   comments ...
      #
      #   $Log$
      #
</pre>
Comments in <I>man</I> pages start with dot-backslash-quote:
<pre>
      .\"   $Id$
      .\"
      .\"   comments ...
      .\"
      .\"   $Log$
      .\"
      .TH ...
</pre>

<p>Once you are comfortable working with these two RCS keywords, you
might want to put some of the other keywords inside character strings
so your program can use them as data for one reason or another (such as
including the program's version number in the "About" message of a Help
window).  However, that topic goes beyond the scope of this document. 
We will look at <code>$Id$</code> and <code>$Log$</code> again after
going over some basic RCS concepts.</p>

<h2>RCS Revisions</h2>

<p>You write the first version of your program just as you would if you
weren't using RCS.  Use a text editor to create source files, compile
them, test the code, and iterate through this process until you have a
working program.  If the program is simple, the development process
might be complete at this stage.  For other programs, the first working
program might be just the first step of a multi-step assignment.  In
either case, you are now ready to put the source files under RCS
management.  The command to do this is <i>ci <list of files></i>.  The
command name <i>ci</i> stands for "check in."  When you execute it, two
things will happen:</p>

<p>First, you will be prompted for a description for each file.  Type a
meaningful description of each file, including a statement about how
the file fits into the overall structure of the project.  It would look
like the Summary part of the file header, and may extend over several
lines.  You terminate this description by typing a period at the
beginning of a line.  If you make a typing mistake, there is a way to
<a href="#change description">change the description</a> for a file
later on.</p>

<p>Second, the file will be moved into the RCS "database" for the
project.  What this really means is that the file, along with some
additional information (such as your file description) will be moved
into the RCS subdirectory and given a new name, which will consist of
the original file name with ",v" at the end.  You can list the contents
of the RCS subdirectory to verify this.  Do a long listing, and you
will also notice that the database file (also called the "history
file") is made read-only.  From now on you can make changes to the file
only by telling RCS that you want to do so.  You could change
permissions on the history file and change its contents manually, but
don't.  Really don't.</p>

<p>At this point you have entered version 1.1 of each of your source
files into the RCS database.  You can use the <i>ci</i> command any
time to add more files to the database.  If, for some reason, you want
the initial revision number to be something other than 1.1, you can
specify it on the <i>ci</i> command line.  For example <i>ci -r3
xyz.cc</i> would enter file xyz.cc with an inital version number of
3.1.</p>

<p>Once you have put a particular file into the project's RCS database,
there are just two things you might want to do with that file:  (1) You
might want to get a copy of the file so you can use it to build your
original program again, or (2) you might want to get a copy so you can
make changes to it.  In the first case, the copy you want should be a
read-only copy because you aren't going to make any changes to the
file.  You would also use this option if you want to get a copy of the
file to print out or to back up. The command to get a read-only copy of
a file is <i>co</i>, which stands for "check out."  If there is more
than one version of a file that you check out, you will be given a copy
of the most recent version.  If you want a copy of an earlier version,
use the "-r" command line option:</p>

<pre>
       co xyx.cc            Get a copy of the most recent revision.
       co -r3.22 xyz.cc     Get a copy of version 3.22.
       co -r3 xyz.cc        Get a copy of the most recent version that
                            is greater than 3.0 and less than 4.0.
</pre>

<p>For the second case, where you want to edit the file, you must
"lock" it using the "-l" option on the <i>co</i> command:</p>

<pre>
       co -l xyz.cc         Get a writeable copy of the file.
</pre>

<p>When there is a development team with more than one person working on
the same code base for a project (not in this course!), it could be
disasterous if two different users changed a file at the same time;
there would have to be some way to merge the changes both users made
into the file when they finished.  RCS disallows this by refusing to
let the same file be locked more than once at a time.  When you lock a
file, you will have write access to the file, and can edit it as you
wish.  If someone (even you) tried to lock the file again, the co
command would generate an error message.  (Another package based on RCS
called CVS overcomes this limitation by merging different users'
changes into a particular revision of the file -- if it can do so
safely.)</p>

<p>When a new version of your program is working, you use the <i>ci</i>
command to put the edited files back into the RCS database again.  At
this point, you will be prompted for another message, the "log message"
for this version.  At this point, write a short summary of just what it
is that makes this version of the file different from the previous
version.  If you fixed a bug, tell what the bug was.  If you added a
new feature, tell what the feature does.  If you changed comments, tell
what kind of changes you made.  The log message does not have to be
long, but it must be concrete and meaningful, not vague.</p>

<p>When you check a file in after editing it, RCS will add one to the
rightmost part of the version number.  For example, the next version
number after 1.9 is 1.10, and the next number after that is 1.11.  If
you want to use a different version number you can use the "-r" command
line option as shown above.  You can't check in a file with a version
number that is less than the latest version.  For example, if you check
out version 1.3 and check the changed file in as 2.1, you can't go back
and create version 1.4.  You can create a "branch" from version 1.3
with numbers like 1.3.1.1, 1.3.1.2, etc. but managing branches is very
cumbersome and should be avoided if at all possible in this course.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to check a file in with a new version number
even though you haven't made any changes to it.  Normally, RCS will
recognize that there are no differences between what you checked out
and what you are checking in, and will discard the new version:</p>

<pre>
      % co -l a_file
      RCS/a_file,v  -->  a_file
      revision 1.1 (locked)
      done
      % ci -r2 a_file
      RCS/a_file,v  <--  a_file
      file is unchanged; reverting to previous revision 1.1
      done
      % 
</pre>

<p>But you can force the new version to be accepted by using the "-f"
command line option:</p>

<pre>
      % co -l a_file
      RCS/a_file,v  -->  a_file
      revision 1.1 (locked)
      done
      % ci -r2 -f a_file
      RCS/a_file,v  <--  a_file
      new revision: 2.1; previous revision: 1.1
      enter log message, terminated with single '.' or end of file:
      >> No chages.  Just increased the version number.
      >> .
      done
      %
</pre>

<H2>Keywords Again</H2>

<p>Once a file is under RCS management, you will see that checking it
out (with or without the lock option) gives you a file in which the
keywords have been expanded.  The <code>$Id$</code> keyword will tell
you the name of the file, its version number, who last modified it, and
when. We put this keyword on the first line of the file so this basic
summary information is always the first thing anyone sees when they
first look at the file.  The <code>$Log$</code> keyword will be
expanded to give the complete modification history of the file, that
is, comment lines from all the log messages you entered when checking
in revised copies of the file along with the revision dates and
numbers.  Be sure these log messages provide useful information for
programmers who might need to work on a file after you.</p>

<H2>Fixing Things Up</H2>

<p>The <i>rcs</i> command lets you do all sorts of things with the
files in your RCS database, including changing the description and log
messages you originally entered.  To change a log message for version
3.2, for example, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre>
      rcs -m3.2:"This is a newly-revised log message \
      for version 3.2 of this file" xyz.cc
</pre>

<p><a name="change description"> To change the initial description
message, use the "-t" command line option, and <i>rcs</i> will prompt
you to type that message in again.</a></p>

<p>You can remove a version (or range of versions) from a file's
history using the "-o" command line option:</p>

<pre>
        rcs -o  xyz.cc            Delete the most recent version.
        rcs -o2.34 xyz.cc         Delete just version 2.34.
        rcs -o2:3.12 xyz.cc       Delete all versions from 2.1 through
                                  3.12.
</pre>

<p>When you are fixing things up, you might want to look at the
complete list of log messages as well as the initial description for
the file.  If so, use the <i>rlog</i> command, which will also tell you
other information about the file as well, such as whether it is
currently locked or not.</p>


<H2><A name="rcs_make">RCS and <i>make</i></A></H2>

<p><I>Make</I> has an implicit rule that tells it how to use <I>co</I>
to get files from an RCS directory.  For example, if there is no
<code>Makefile</code> in the current directory and you invoke
<I>make</I> with no target names on the command line, <I>make</I> will
automatically try to get a <code>Makefile</code> using the <I>co</I>
command.  Also, if <I>make</I> needs a <code>.c</code> or
<code>.cc</code> file to build a <code>.o</code> or executable file, it
will automatically try to get it using <I>co</I>.</p>

<p>If you want <I>make</I> to check out a particular version of a file,
you can set the <I>make</I> variable COFLAGS to the proper "-r" option
that you want.  For example, if you have implemented a project that has
files with version numbers in the form 1.x for the first use case, 2.x
for the second use case, etc., you can reconstruct the second use case
by making sure the project directory is clean (no Makefile, no source
files, no man pages, no object files, and no executable files), and
then issuing the command:</p>

<pre>
      make COFLAGS=-r2
</pre>

<p>First <I>make</I> will check out the last Makefile with a version
number between 2.0 and 3.0, and then will do the same for all other
files that it needs to check out using implicit rules.  If you have any
rules in the Makefile that include explicit <I>co</I> commands, be sure
to reference the <code>COFLAGS</code> variable on the command line, as
in this example:</p>

<pre>
      myheaders :
      &lt;tab&gt; co $(COFLAGS) a_header.h b_header.h
</pre>

<p>One final issue on this topic is that <I>co</I> will fail if it is
told to check out a file with a particular version number, but if that
revision doesn't exist.  For example, if you have only revisions 1.1
and 3.1 of <I>a_header.h</I>, the example above will cause <I>co</I> to
fail, and <I>make</I> will exit then too.  (This behavior of
<I>make</I> can be overridden, but that's not the point here.)  The
solution is to have used the "-f" option to <I>ci</I> as shown earlier
to create revision 2.1, even though it is has no changes from revision
1.1.</p>

<H2>Using <I>ident</I></H2>

<p>The <I>ident</I> command searches object or executable files for RCS
keywords and prints them out.  It can be used to determine which
version of your source files were used to build a particular instance
of an executable.  To use this feature, put lines like this outside of
any function or class definitions of all your <code>.cc</code>
files:</p>

<pre>
      static char *rcs_version =
        "$Id$";
</pre>

<p>The keyword is on a separate line because it will be expanded to a
long string that won't fit on the first line once you check the file in
and back out again.  Once you have built a program, just give its name
as an argument to <I>ident</I> and you will be able to see the names
and versions of all the .cc files that were used to build the
executable.</p>
