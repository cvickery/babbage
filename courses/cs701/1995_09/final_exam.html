<OL>
<LI>List in order the system calls a client would make in order
to create a socket connection with a server. For each function,
tell its purpose, the arguments it takes, the value it returns
(if any), and what system calls (if any) the server would need
to have made in order for the client's call to succeed.

<LI>Assuming a client and server have established a socket
connection, they can exchange messages using <I>read()</I> and
<I>write()</I> system calls. Assume either the client or server
executes &quot;<TT>bytesRead = read(fd, buffer, 512);</TT>&quot;
and tell what conditions (if any) might cause <TT>bytesRead</TT>
to take on the values <TT>-1, 0, 321, 512,</TT> and <TT>1024</TT>.
In addition, tell what might cause the <I>read()</I> function
never to return at all.

<LI>Tell the difference between an <I>iterative</I> and a <I>concurrent</I>
server. Tell the types of application where each would be appropriate,
and outline algorithms that could be used to implement a server
of each type.

<LI>For both the X Window System and the <I>ftp</I> protocol,
compare and contrast the roles of <I>client</I> and <I>server</I>
programs. Be sure your answer includes the following two pieces
of information:
<UL>
<LI>For both <I>X</I> and <I>ftp,</I> tell which program (the
client or the server) sends <I>requests</I> and which one sends
<I>replies.</I> 
<LI>For both X and <I>ftp,</I> give examples of the kinds of requests
and replies that are involved<I>.</I> 
</UL>
<LI>What is the role of the following functions in a toolkit-based
application?
<UL>
<LI><I>XtVaAppInitialize()</I> 
<LI><I>XtAppMainLoop()</I> 
<LI><I>XtAddCallback()</I> 
</UL>
<LI>Describe the arguments that are passed to a callback function.
What does a callback function do when it finishes processing a
callback event? How can you debug a callback function using <I>gdb</I>
or <I>ddd?</I>
