When the project is complete, send me an e-mail message telling me the
path to the project directory for this assignment.<P>

The project directory is to contain an RCS subdirectory where you are
to keep the source files for two separate programs (a Web server and a
Web client), and a Makefile, all under rcs management.  In addition,
the directory <code>~/man/man1</code> is to contain <i>man</i> pages
for the executable programs you write for this project.<P>

You may leave a <code>README</code> file in the project directory if
you think that one is needed, but I neither expect nor require you to
do so.<P>

<H2>Project Description</H2>

You are to write two programs, a World Wide Web server, and a World
Wide Web client (also known as a Web browser).<p>

<blockquote>
It is a requirement for this project that both your programs interact
properly with standard Web programs in use on the Web.  That is, your
server must be able to respond to requests from Netscape and Lynx, and
your client must be able to make requests to servers such as the ones
running on <i>babbage</i> and <i>qcunix1</i>.<p>
</blockquote>

Your programs are to exchange information using the Hypertext Transfer
Protocol (HTTP).  The full documentation of the HTTP protocol is
available at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Protocols/HTTP/1.0/spec.html">
The WWW Consortium</a>, but you should not need to read the full
document.  This assignment page includes a summary of the parts of the
protocol that you need to handle.<p>

The steps you are to follow to develop the two programs are listed
below.  First develop your server, and then start working on your
client, which is an open-ended exercise.  The list of steps for the
programs tell you how far you are expected to get this term.<p>

<h2>HTTP Description</h2>

The HTTP description provided here is for a compatible subset of the
HTTP/1.0 Protocol Specification.  Although some parts of the protocol
are omitted from this description and some parts are given more
concrete interpretations than the specification document does, clients
and servers that use the protocol described here will be compatible
with the basic features of most other web clients and servers in use on
the Internet today.<p>

HTTP servers use a stream socket to receive <i>request messages</i>
from HTTP clients, and to send <i>response messages</i> in return.  Your
server is to operate as an iterative server: It accepts a connection
from a client, reads the client's request, sends a reply to the client,
closes the socket, and then becomes ready to accept a connection from
another client.<p>

Your server is to use the default port number assigned to you, based on
the last three digits of your ID number.  It must accept a command line
argument that allows the user to specify an alternate port number.<p>

<h2>Request Messages</h2>

A request is a text message that consists of a <i>Request-Line</i>,
followed by zero or more <i>Request-Headers</i>, followed by
<code>CRLF</code> (Ascii Carriage Return and Linefeed characters).  The
format of a <i>Request-Line</i> is "<code>GET &lt;uri&gt; HTTP/1.0
CRLF</code>", with <i>&lt;uri&gt;</i> (Universal Resource Identifier)
being a Unix pathname relative to the server's root directory.<p>

The optional Request Headers consist of any number of text lines terminated by
<code>CRLF</code>.  Your client must generate at least one valid
request header consisting of a line in the form <code>User-Agent:
&lt;identifier&gt;CRLF</code>.  The &lt;identifier&gt; is a string that
identifies your client program, including its RCS version number.  Your
server will not interpret request headers, but will copy them all to
its log file.  Fuller descriptions of your client and server are given
below.<p>

In summary, a request message consists of a Request-Line, zero or more
Request-Header lines, and a terminating <code>CRLF</code>.  The server
knows it has read all of a client's request when it gets a blank line
of text.<p>

<h2>Response Messages</h2>

Once a server reads all of a client's request message, is replies by
writing a <i>Response Message</i> to the socket.  A Response Message
consists of a <i>Status Line</i>, followed by zero or more
<i>Response-Headers</i>, followed by zero or more
<i>Entity-Headers</i>, followed by a <code>CRLF</code>, optionally
followed by an <i>Entity-Body</i>.<p>

The Status Line consists of a version string ("HTTP/1.0"), one or more
spaces, a 3-digit code number, one or more spaces, some text that
describes the status code, and finally the end of line code, 
(<code>CRLF</code>).  Here is a list of status codes and suggested text
that your server might generate:<p>

<blockquote><pre>
200 OK
204 No Content
400 Bad Request
403 Forbidden
404 Not Found
500 Internal Server Error
501 Not Implemented
</pre></blockquote>

The meanings of these codes should be pretty self-evident: 200 means
the request was all right, 204 means the request was for an empty file,
400 means there was something wrong with the syntax of the request, 403
means the request was for a file that exists but for which the server
does not have read access, 404 means the request was for a file that
does not exist.  500 will probably never occur, and 501 is a way of
handling requests that your server recognizes but can't handle yet.<p>

Your server will return at least one Response-Header, a line containing
"<code>Server: &lt;identifier&gt;CRLF</code>".  Like the User-Agent line
sent by the client, this line is to contain an identifier string giving
the name and RCS version of your server.<p>

If the server is going to return a file to the client, it first sends
an Entity Header that describes the file being returned.  In
particular, the server sends an Entity Header line containing
"<code>Content-Length: &lt;size&gt;CR</code>", where <i>size</i> is the
length of the file, in bytes, being returned as the Entity Body.  Your
server must also send a second Entity Header line containing
"<code>Content-Type &ltmedia-type&gtCRLF"</code>.  The
<i>media-type</i> will normally be the string,
"<code>text/plain</code>", but it might be one of these common
names:<p>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt><code>text/html</code><dd>A Hypertext Markup Language web page.
<dt><code>image/gif</code><dd>A picture in GIF format.
<dt><code>application/octet-stream</code><dd>An arbitrary binary file.
<dt><code>audio/basic</code><dd>An audio file.
<dt><code>video/mpeg</code><dd>An MPEG movie.
</dl>
</blockquote>

Note: Your server might return one of these additonal content types,
but I don't expect your client to know what to do with them!<p>

Unless the server returns a status code of 204 (no content), it must
return the contents of the requested file as the Entity Body part of
its reply.  The client can tell when the Entity Body begins because it
is separated from the header lines by an empty line.  When the server
has written all of the file to the client, it closes its end of the
socket, which signals the client that the reply is complete.  The
client could also tell how many bytes it will receive by examining the
Content-Length header line, but this is not a reliable technique.  The
Content-Length value can be used by clients to provide users with
feedback about how much longer it will take to retrieve the requested
document.<p>

<h2>The Server Program</h2>

Your server is to be developed in a sequence of steps.  Each of the
steps is to be a working program, with the step number corresponding to
the RCS version number of the source code.<p>

<ol>

<li>When the server starts running, it is to create a log file and
write a message to that file giving the current date and time, the name
of the host on which the server is running, and the port number it is
using.  It must be possible to read the current contents of the log
file while the server is running.  The way to terminate the server is
to kill it.  When the server is killed it is to write another message
to the log file giving the date and time and a message indicating that
it is terminating.<p>

The server's log file is to be written in the same directory as the
server's executable file, and must have the same name as the server's
executable file, but with an extension of <code>.log</code>.  You must
determine the name of the server's executable file from the value of
<code>argv[0]</code> passed to <i>main()</i>.<p>

<b>Optional:</b>  If the environment variable <code>SERVER_LOG</code> is set,
use that as the full pathname to the server's log file instead of the
name specified above.<p>

<b>Note:</b>  If you write debugging information to the log file (a
deprecated practice; use <i>gdb</i> or <i>ddd</i> instead), you must be
sure no such messages are written in the version of the assignment that
you submit.<p>

<b>Remember!</b>  You must code this step, and no more, as a working
program before you proceed to work on the next step.  The RCS version
number for this program is to be 1.1.  This policy applies to all steps
in this project.<p>

<li>For this step, the server accepts connections on your "well-known"
port.  For each client, read the entire request from the socket, write
it to the log file, write back a "HTTP/1.0 501 Not Implemented"
response message, and close the socket.<p>

<b>Note:</b>  Test this and all subsequent versions of your server
using Lynx and Netscape.<p>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.2.<p>


<li>For each client request, be sure the request method is
"<code>GET</code>" and the HTTP-version is "<code>HTTP/1.0</code>".  If
either is wrong, send a "400 Bad Request" response and close the
socket.  Otherwise send a "501 Not Implemented" response.<P>

<b>Optional:</b>  You could accept version numbers other than 1.0,
provided they start with "HTTP/."<p>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.3.<p>

<li>Interpret the URI field of a request as the pathname of a file or
directory relative to the directory specified by the environment
variable, "<code>SERVER_ROOT</code>".  Use <i>stat()</i> to determine
whether it is a directory or a file.  If it is a directory, return "501
Not Implemented."  If it is a file of size zero, return "204 No
Content."  If it is a file, open it for reading and copy it to the
client as the Entity Body of the response.  (Be sure to set the
Content-Length" header line properly.)  If the call to <i>open()</i>
fails, return "403 Forbidden."  If the file does not exist, return "404
Not Found."<P>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.4.<p>

<hr>
All remaining steps for the server are optional.<p>

<li>If the client requests a directory, create a directory listing and
return it as the Entity Body of the response.<P>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.5.<p>

<li>If the request is for a file and the name of the file ends in
".gif", send a Content-Type" header of "image/gif" instead of
"text/plain".<P>

<li>If the request is for a file and the name of the file ends in
".cgi", execute the file, with the program's standard output written as
the Entity Body of the response.<p>

</ol>

<h2><a name="browser">The Client Program</a></h2>

Your browser is to be developed in a sequence of steps. Each of the
steps is to be a working program, with the step number corresponding to
the RCS version number of the source code. <p>

<ol>

<li>Write a main program that reads command lines from the user, and
terminates when the user types "quit" or "exit".<P>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.1.<p>

<li>Write a function named <i>parseURL()</i>.  It must be in a separate
source file, and there must be a header file named <code>parseurl.h</code>
containing the function prototype for this function.  (#include the
header file in both your .c files.)  <i>parseURL()</i> must receive the
command line entered by the user as one argument, and it is to return
the parsed URL either as a structure or as an array of strings, as
discussed in class.  Use <i>gdb</i> or <i>ddd</i> to verify that your
parser is working correctly.<p>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.2.<p>

<li>Use the information from the parsed url to create a socket
connection to the specified server and port number.  Write a valid
request message to the server based on the parsed url, and read the
server's reply.  When the server closes the socket, prompt the user for
another URL.  If the environment variable <code>CLIENT_FILE</code> is
set to the pathname of a file, write the server's reply to it.  If the
status code of the server's reply does not begin with the character "2"
display the complete Status Line of the server's reply to the user.<p>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.3.<p>

<hr>

All remaining steps for the client are optional.<p>

<li>Provide a progress indicator so the user can tell how much longer
it will take for a server's reply to arrive.<p>

<b>Remember!</b>  The RCS version number for this step must be 1.4.<p>


<li>Using <a
href="ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/Motif_Sample.tar">Motif_Sample</a>
as a model, implement an X Window user interface for your client. 
Display the server's reply, without change, in the text widget.<p>

<li>Display only the Entity Body of the server's reply in the text
widget.<p>

<li>If the Entity Body is an HTML document, remove all html markup
items from the information displayed in the text widget.  Insert a line
break for each &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/Hn&gt; item (where <i>n</i> is a
digit from 1 to 9).
