When the project is complete, send me an e-mail message telling me the
path to the project directory for this exercise.  The project directory
shall contain three source files, a Makefile, and nothing else.  In
addition, the directory <code>~/man/man1</code> is to contain a
<i>man</i> page for the executable program.  You may leave a
<code>README</code> file in the project directory if you think that one
is needed, but I neither expect nor require you to do so.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

Your assignment is to modify and extend Program 1.8 from the Stevens
textbook.  First create a project directory to work in and get a copy
of the program, the header file, and the definition file for the
functions <i>err_ret()</i> and <i>err_sys()</i> from
<code>~vickery/CS-701/APUE</code>.  You will find Program 1.8 and
<code>ourhdr.h</code> in <code>proc/shell2.c</code>, and
<code>error.c</code> in <code>lib.sun</code>.<P>

Do the exercise as a sequence of steps.  Most of you will have done
some or all of Steps 2 and 3 before you got the assignment, so you
will have to go back and do Step 1 out of sequence.<P>

<ol>

<li>Copy the default Makefile from your home directory to the project
directory, use the command, "chmod 600 Makefile" to make it writeable,
and add the following lines to the end of it:

<blockquote>
<pre>
OBJS = shell2.o error.o

myshell :  $(OBJS)
        $(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(OBJS) $(LDLIBS) -o $@
</pre>
</blockquote>

Be sure the last line is indented using a <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code>
character, not spaces.  You should now be able to build the executable
shell2 program by issuing the command, "make".<P>

<li>Edit <code>shell2.c</code> so that it follows the <A
HREF="../coding_guidelines.html"> Coding Guidelines</A> for this
course.  You do not have to edit the other two files.<P>

  <ol>
  <li>Add file header and function header comment blocks.
  <li>Fix the program so that it behaves "reasonably" if the user enters
      an empty command line.
  <li>Make calls to <i>exit()</i> meet the specifications of the Coding
      Guidelines.
  <li>Fix anything else you can spot.
  </ol><P>

Be sure the program still works!<P>

<li>Change the program so that the user can enter command line arguments,
like "ls -l a*".  You may place a "reasonable" limit on the number of
command line arguments the user may enter.<P>

To do this, you will have to break each command line into a sequence of
space-separated tokens using the <i>strtok()</i> standard library function.
There is sample code to do this in the Harbison and Steele book listed in
the <A HREF="../description.html#harbison">CS-701 Course Description</A>.<P>

It would be very hard to use the <i>execlp()</i> function to handle
command line arguments.  You would have to have a separate call for each
of the different number of number of arguments the user might enter!  Instead,
look up the <i>execvp()</i> function in the <i>man</i> pages, and use that.
You will save each of the pointers returned by <i>strtok()</i> in an array,
and pass the array as the second argument to <i>execvp()</i>.<P>

<b>Extra Credit:</b> Handle command line arguments in quotes properly.<P>

<li>As it stands, typing <code>^C</i> when the program is running causes
the "<code>interrupt</code>" message to be displayed, a new prompt to
be issued, and the program exits.  Fix the program so it continues to
accept command lines instead of exiting.<P>

To do this, you will have to check to see if the global variable
<code>errno</code> is set to <code>EINTR</code> (defined in
<code>errno.h</code>) when the <i>fgets()</i> function returns
<code>NULL</code>.  If so, repeat the <i>fgets()</i> instead of
exiting.<P>

<b>Extra Credit:</b>  Make the program contine to accept commands no matter
how many times the user types <code>^C</code>.<P>

<li>Write a <i>man</i> page for the new shell program.  It may be very
brief, but it must be in standard <i>man</i> page format, and it must
be installed properly.  Consult the <A HREF="../man_pages.html">man page handout</A>
for this course and/or the
<i>man</i> entry in Section 5 of the on-line <i>man</i> pages for information
on how to mark up the text of your <i>man</i> page.<P>
