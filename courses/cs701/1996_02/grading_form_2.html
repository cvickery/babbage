<h3>USER DOCUMENTATION (2.5 points)</h3>

match that of standard Unix <i>man</i> pages; is the information well
organized?  Is the information presented clearly, completely, and yet

pages suitable for an audience of programmers who might use the functions
you developed.<P>

<h3>WRITTEN REPORT (Graded Separately)</h3>
