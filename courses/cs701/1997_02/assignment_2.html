When the assignment is complete, send me an email message telling me
the path to the project directory.  The project directory is to contain
an RCS subdirectory, and nothing else.  Consult "<a
href="../using_rcs.html">Using RCS</a>" for information on how to set
up your project directory and use RCS for project management.  In
addition, the <code>~/man</code> directory tree is to contain
<i>man</i> pages for the two executable programs.  See "<a
href="../man_pages.html">How to Write a Man Page</a>" for information
on how to prepare your <code>man</code> pages.<p>

<DT><B>Requirements:</B><DD>

The project is to be done as a sequence of Steps as outlined below. 
You will not receive credit for work on a particular step unless all
previous steps are complete.  All the files for a given Step (Makefile,
source code, and documentation) must have RCS Revision numbers with the
number to the left of the decimal point equal to the Step number given
below.  After checking out the Makefile for a given step, typing "make
STEP=&lt;<i>n</i>&gt; install" must build and install the executable
and documentation files for that step. (&lt;<i>n</i>&gt; is the Step
number.)<p>

You may also leave a <code>README</code> file in the project directory
if you think that one is needed, but I neither expect nor require you
to do so.<p>

In addition to the information given here, be sure to consult the <A
HREF="grading_form_2.html">Grading Form for this assignment</A>, which
includes additional information about the requirements for this
project.

<H3 ALIGN=center><A NAME="as-h3-64870">Project Description</A></H3>

This is an exercise in distributed computing.  There are two programs
to write.  In this document they will be called <i>fe</i> and <i>be</i>
for "front-end" and "back-end" respectively, but you may give them any
descriptive names you choose.<p>

The <i>be</i> program is a network server, a program that runs
continuously on some host.  It's job is to respond to requests from
client programs, which are the <i>fe</i> program being run
interactively by users.  The <i>be</i> maintains a database called a
<i>property list</i>.  People use the <i>fe</i> program to add items to
the property list and request information about it.<p>

The project is called "Ship in a Bottle" because the operations of
building and querying a property list are done by commands entered
remotely from the computer that maintains the list.  The analogy is to
building a wooden ship model inside a bottle using special tools from
outside the bottle.<p>

A property list is a data structure that contains
{&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;&lt;<i>value</i>&gt;} triples. 
Each &lt;<i>name</i>&gt; may occur any number of times in the list, but
each {&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;} pair must occur no more
than once in the list.  The names are arbitrary text strings, and the
values are arbitrary numbers or text strings.  For example, a property
list for a computer might have two properties named "host ID," one
with  an integer value giving the computer's IP address and the other
with a text string value giving the computer's fully qualified domain
name.  ("babbage.cs.qc.edu"  is an example of a fully-qualified domain
name.)<p>

Code and document each step of the project separately.  Use the
Makefile provided to you as a starting point for your own Makefile so
that any step can be recreated when the project is complete.<p>

<DL>
<DT><B><A Name="Step1">Step 1 -- Send strings from client to server</A></B><DD><p>

Write a server (<i>be</i>) that accepts socket connections on a
"well-known" port number.  Your assigned well-known port number is the
last four digits of your ID number.  (If your assigned port number is
less than 1,000, add 1,000 to it.)  Allow the user to override the
default port number by giving an alternate value as a command line
argument.  Everyone has at least five port numbers they can use without
conflicting with anyone else in the course: add 1, 2, 3, or 4 to you
assigned number.<p>

Write a client (<i>fe</i>) that takes a host name and and optional port
number as command line arguments, and connects to your <i>be</i>
running on that host. If the user doesn't supply a port number, use
your assigned well-known port number.  This program prompts the user to
enter a string.  If the user types "q", close the connection to the
server, and exit the program.  Otherwise, write the string to the
server, and prompt the user to enter another string.<p>

When you write the string to the server, first send a 4-byte integer
(in network byte order) telling how long the string is, and then write
the string itself.  When <i>be</i> receives a string, it prints it out,
and tries to read another string from the client.  When <i>be</i>
detects end of file on the socket (the <i>read()</i> system call will
return zero as the number of bytes read), it closes its end of the
socket, and tries to accept a connection from another client.<p>

For this step, the normal way to terminate <i>be</i> is to send it
<code>SIGINT</code>.<p>

<B>Notes:</B> For this and all succeeding steps, <i>fe</i> must run
correctly on <i>qcunix1</i> as well as in the
laboratory.  Of course you will have to recompile your program to run it
on <i>qcunix1</i>, but it must not require any changes to the source
code in order to compile and run the program there.  You do not have to
be able to run <i>be</i> on <i>qcunix1</i>, however.<p>

When you build your programs in the laboratory, they have to be linked
with <code>libsocket.so</code> and <code>libnls.so</code>, which is set
up in the sample Makefile. However, neither of these libraries is used
on <i>qcunix1</i>.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Step2">Step 2 -- <I>Terminate</I> and <I>Value</I> 							 messages</A></B><DD><p>

In this step we start to develop the protocol for exchanging messages
between <i>be</i> and <i>fe</i> processes.<p>

Each message begins with a "siab header", which consists of four 4-byte
integers; each integer is transmitted in network byte order.  ("siab"
stands for "Ship in a Bottle").  The first integer tells how many bytes
there are in the entire message, including the header and any
additional bytes that are part of the message.  The next integer tells
the type of message being sent.  The message type will be either 0,
meaning "Terminate," or 1, meaning "Data Value".  For data value
messages, the third integer tells the type of data value being sent. 
The data type will be 1, meaning "text string," 2, meaning "integer,"
or 3, meaning "floating-point string."  The last integer in the header
is the value of the integer if the data type is 2.  Otherwise, it is
the length of the text or floating-point string, in bytes.<p>

If you send the entire siab header using a single <i>write()</i> system
call, the program that receives a message will be able to read the
entire header with one call to <i>read()</i>.  Strictly speaking, you
should not be able to count on this when using <code>SOCK_STREAM</code>
sockets, but for our purposes it will "always" work.<p>

 <blockquote>
<HR>
[<i>Experiment</i>: A client writes 1,000,000 bytes to a socket
endlessly, and a server reads 1,000,000 bytes from the other end of the
socket endlessly.  Run the client on <i>qcunix1</i>, <i>babbage</i>,
and <i>cougar</i>, and run the server on <i>qcunix1</i> and on
<i>babbage</i>.

The important statistic here is the minimum number of bytes received by
a single call to <i>read()</i>.  Except when both the client and server
run on <i>qcunix1</i>, I never observed fewer bytes than the size of a
complete siab header being read by the server.]

<HR>

</blockquote>


If the data type is 1 or 3, the siab header is followed immediately by
the string itself.<p>

For this step, <i>fe</i> again connects to the server, and then prompts
the user to enter a string.  If the string is "q" the program closes
its socket connection to the server and exits.  If the string is "exit"
the program writes a siab message with the message type field set to 0, then
closes its socket connection to the server and exits.<p>

If the user types a string consisting entirely of decimal digits,
convert the string to an integer and send it to the server in a properly
formatted siab data message.  If the string consists entirely of digits
and exactly one period, send the string to the server as a
floating-point string.  (Optional: accept plus and minus characters and
an exponent field.)  If the string does not meet either of these
criteria, send it to the server as a text string.<p>

As in <A HREF="#Step1">Step 1</A>, <i>fe</i> continues to run until the user types "q" (or "exit") in response to the prompt.<p>

For this step <i>be</i> displays each data value and its type.  It may
seem silly, but floating-point strings must be converted to doubles
(use <i>strtod()</i>) and printed using the <i>printf()</i>'s
<code>%f</code> format.  (C++ programmers may use <code>cout</code>,
but it still must be the double value that is output, not the string.)

When a terminate message is received, the server prints an appropriate
message and exits.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Step3">Step 3 -- Command File (<I>fe</I>) and Log File 						(<I>be</I>)</A></B><DD><p>

When the server starts up, it opens a "log file" with a filename that
consists of the program's name with "<code>.log</code>" at the end. 
Use <code>argv[0]</code> to determine the program's name.  Instead of
writing messages to <i>stdout</i>, write text messages to the log
file.  Each log file message must include the time and date when it was
written, the IP address (or hostname) of the computer that sent the
message, the message type, the data type, and the data value.  Be sure
the log file includes a message telling when the server exited, even if
it is terminated by <code>SIGINT</code>.  It must be possible to read
the latest message written to the log file as soon as it is written.<p>

Add a command line option to <i>fe</i> that specifies a filename from
which it reads commands.  Echo commands to the screen as they are read
from the file.  If end of file is reached without a "q" or "exit"
command, the program should do an automatic "q" command.  (If you
prefer, you may make the program prompt for additional commands from
the user if it reaches the end of the command file.)  Use "-f" to
indicate the presence of a filename on the command line.  If there is
no command file, <i>fe</i> runs interactively as usual.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Step4">Step 4 -- <I>Add</I> and <I>Change</I> messages</A></B><DD><p>

Now the the client and the server both send messages to each other.  An
exchange always begins with the client sending a <i>request</i> to the
server and the server sending a <i>reply</i> to the client.  Requests
and replies always alternate.  A request may consist of a sequence of
siab messages, but for this step a reply always consists of exactly one
siab message.<p>

Now <i>fe</i> prompts the user to enter a command instead of just a data
value.  Each command consists of a sequence of tokens separated by
spaces.  (Use <i>strtok()</i> to parse command lines.)  The first token
is a command name, which will be one of the following words:<p>

<center>
<table border>
<TR><TH>Command<TH>Meaning

<TR><TD align=center>q<TD>Exit <i>fe</i>.

<TR><TD align=center>exit<TD>Send a terminate message to <i>be</i> and
exit <i>fe</i>. 

<TR><TD align=center>add<TD>Add a node to the property list.  There
will be two more tokens on the command line.  The first is the name of
the property node, and the second is the value of the node, with the
data type implied by the format of that token, as in Step 2.  In the
case of text string values, the value may consist of an arbitrary
number of tokens.

<TR><TD align=center>change<TD>Change the value of a node that is already in the
property list.  The command line has the same syntax as <i>add</i>
commands.
</table>
</center><p> 

For both the <i>add</i> and <i>change</i> commands, <i>fe</i> will send
two siab messages to the server.  The first message will have a
message type of 2 for "add" or 3 for "change;" the last word of the
header will tell the length of the property name, and the name itself
will be sent immediately after the header.  The second message will
be type 1 ("data"), and will send the property value as described for
Step 2.<p>

The server will send a single reply message after receiving a complete
add or change request.  The message will be type 4 ("positive
acknowledge") if the server was able to comply with the request or type
5 ("negative acknowledge") if the server was unable to comply with the
request.  The server will reply with a positive acknowledgement unless
(1) The request was <i>add</i>, but the
{&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;} tuple already exists in the
property list or (2) The request was <i>change</i> but the
{&lt;<i>name</i>&gt;&lt;<i>type</i>&gt;} tuple does not exist in the
property list.<p>

The <i>fe</i> program does not prompt for a new command until it
receives a reply from the server.  If the reply is a positive
acknowledgement, <i>fe</i> justs prompts for the next command as
usual.  However, if the reply is a negative acknowledgement <i>fe</i>
displays an error message before issuing the next prompt.<p>

<B>Note:</B>  Now that both programs need to read siab messages, write
a single function that will read a complete siab message from a
socket.  Put the code for this function in a separate source file, put
the function prototype for the function into a header file, and link
both <i>fe</i> and <i>be</i> to the common object file.  Of course, you
may define other utility functions and put them in your
separately-compiled module also.  There is a header file in
<code>~vickery/CS-701/siab_utils.h</code> that you may use as a
starting point for your own header file, if you like.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Step5">Step 5 -- <I>Get</I> messages</A></B><DD><p>

Now add query commands to <i>fe</i>.  The new commands and their
meanings are as follows:<p>

<center><table border>
<TR><TH>Command<TH>Meaning

<TR><TD align=center>get value<TD>There will be two more tokens on the
command line, the first is a property name, and the second is a
property type, which will be one of the words, "string," "integer," or
"float."  <i>fe</i> responds with a message giving the corresponding
value or an error message indicating that the specified tuple does not
exist in the property list.

<TR><TD align=center>get types<TD>There is one more token on the
command line, a property name.  <i>fe</i> displays a list of types
defined for that name in the property list, or an indication that the
specified name does not exist in the list at all.

<TR><TD align=center>get names<TD>There are no more tokens on the
command line. <i>fe</i> displays a list of all property names defined
in the property list or a message saying that the list is empty.

</table></center><p> 

For "get value" commands, <i>fe</i> sends a siab message with message
type equal to 6, data type of 1, 2, or 3 depending on the type
specified by the user, and the rest of the message consists of the name
length in the last word of the header and the name string itself
following the message header.  The server replies with either a message
type of 1 (data) or 5 (negative acknowledgement).<p>

For "get types" commands, <i>fe</i> sends a siab message with message
type equal to 7, data type of one (text), and the rest of the message
consists of the name length in the last word of the header and the name
string itself following the header.  The server replies with a message
type of 4 (Positive Acknowledgement) message with a data type code of 4
(type list) and a count of the number of types in the last word of the
header.  The message header is followed by that number of additional
integers containing codes for the types defined for the property name. 
The integer codes are the same as always: 1 for text, 2 for integer,
and 3 for floating-point.<p>

For "get names" commands, <i>fe</i> sends a siab message with message
type equal to 8, and the rest of the header must contain zeros.  The
server replies with a message of type 4 (positive acknowledgement). 
The last word of the header of this reply tells how many different
property names there are.  The server then sends a type 1 (data value)
message for each different name that occurs in the property list.  This
list of names should be sent in alphabetical order, but that is not
required.  If the list is empty, the acknowledgement message will have
a length field of zero, and there will be no data value messages after
it.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Step6">Step 6 -- <I>Curses</I> User Interface</A>
</B><DD><p>

Use the <i>curses</i> package to provide a full-screen user interface
to <i>fe</i> instead of the command-line version.  The screen shows all
property names in alphabetical order in one column.  The next two
columns give the types and values for that name.  The user can use the
arrow keys and &lt;<code>tab</code>&gt; key to scroll through the list
and to move to diffent columns, and can edit the list by typing in new
values.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Step7">Step 7 -- Concurrent Server</A></B><DD><p>

<B>This step is optional!</B><p>

Change from an iterative server to a concurrent server so that two
users can view and edit the property list simultaneously without
interfering with each other.  You will have to introduce a mechanism so
that all clients are notified with the list is changed, and you will
have to insure that changes made by one user do not conflict with
changes made by another user at the same time.<p>

<DT><B><A Name="Ideas">Ideas for Other Features</A></B><DD><p>

  <UL>

    <LI>Support quoted strings for property names and for text values.

    <LI>Implement support for deleting nodes from the property list.

    <LI>Add a command for saving the property list to a file.  A command
    line option would tell the server to load the property list from a
    file when it starts up.

    <LI>Add more data types.  Money and dates are good candidates.

    <LI>Timestamp changes to the property list, and let users query
    creation and last modification times.

    <LI>Make the property list hierarchical.  Each list has a key (such
    as an IP address(?)) and users can query/edit different lists.

    <LI>Distribute property lists across the network.  When <i>fe</i>
    starts up it sends out a datagram asking what servers are available,
    and lets the user select which one is to be the target of each
    command.

Here is a summary of all the types of messages.  All messages start with
a "message header" consisting of:

<UL>

  <LI><B>Message Length</B>.  A 4-byte integer in network byte order
  giving the total number of bytes in the message, including any bytes
  that follow the message header.

  <LI><B>Message Type</B>.  A 4-byte integer in network byte order that
  is a code for the type of message.  The table below lists the Message
  Type Codes and their meanings.

  <LI><B>Data Type</B>.  A 4-byte integer in network byte order that is
  a code for the type of data that is conveyed with the message.  The
  next table above lists the Data Type Codes and their meanings.  Some
  message types do not use this field, in which case it is zero.
