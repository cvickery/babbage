When the assignment is complete, send me an email message telling me
the path to the project directory.  The project directory is to contain
an RCS subdirectory, and nothing else.  Consult "<a
href="../using_rcs.html">Using RCS</a>" for information on how to set
up your project directory and use RCS for project management.  In
addition, the <code>~/man</code> directory tree is to contain a
<i>man</i> page for the executable program.  See "<a
href="../man_pages.html">How to Write a Man Page</a>" for information
on how to prepare your <code>man</code> page.<p>

You may also leave a <code>README</code> file in the project directory
if you think that one is needed, but I neither expect nor require you
to do so.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

You are to write a utility program that can be used to find out
information about files on a UNIX system.  In class I called the program
<code>debe</code> in honor of an old utility program I used when I first
started using computers (its name stood for "does everything but eat"!),
but you may give your program any meaningful name you like.  You should
follow the UNIX convention of naming your program with a terse mnemonic
for what the program does.<p>

The program accepts a set of command line arguments, and produces
informative messages based on the arguments given.  Arguments may be
given in any order, and may be repeated any number of times.  They are
to operate as follows:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>-t</CODE><DD>The next argument is an entity name, and the program
tells the type of entity it names, whether it is a regular file, a
directory, a special file, etc.  Use the information returned by
<i>stat()</i> to determine the type.  If the call to <i>stat()</i>
fails, give an informative message, but do not abort the program.  (This
rule holds for all error conditions your program encounters.)<p>
<B>Optional:</B> If the entity is a regular file, tell whether it is a
text file or a binary file.<p>

<DT><CODE>-i</CODE><DD>The next argument is an entity name, and the
program tells everything it can about that entity.<p>

<DT><CODE>-s</CODE><DD>The next argument is an entity name.  If the
<code>-s</code> argument has already appeared, tell whether this entity
is the same one as the previous one or not.<p>

<DT><CODE>-c</CODE><DD>The next argument is an entity name.  If the
<code>-c</code> argument has already appeared and both entities are
regular files, tell whether the files contain exactly the same
information or not.<p>
</DL>

Write your program so that command line arguments can be entered in any
sequence and any number of times.  The program must not terminate until
all command line arguments have been processed, regardless of what the
user types on the command line.  Do not write the program so that it
interacts with the user.<p>

You may add other "interesting" options to your program.  If you do, be
sure to document them in your <i>man</i> page.<p>

It is all right to write the program as a single source module.  Modify
your Makefile so that the <i>make</i> command will build your program
as its default target.<p>
