<P>
1. List the functions a server would use to set up a &quot;well-known&quot;
socket for communicating with clients, and tell what each function
does.
<P>
2. List the functions a client would use to connect to a server,
and tell what each function does.  Assume the program already
knows the server's host name and port number, and go from there.
<P>
3. Write a program that computes the value of   to 99,000,000
places and prints how many digits it has completed whenever the
user types  <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">^C</FONT></TT>.
 You may assume that someone has already written a function named
 <I>computePi()</I> that does the actual computation and that
every time this function computes a digit, it increments a global
<I>int</I> named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">numDigits</FONT></TT>.
 Assume that the function prototype for <I>computePi()</I> is
given to you in a header file named  <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">piStuff.h</FONT></TT>.
<P>
4. Assume the program you wrote for Question 3 is in a file named
 <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">miStuff.cc</FONT></TT> and
that the source code for <I>computePI()</I> is in another file
named  <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">pyStuff.cc</FONT></TT>.
 Write a Makefile that will build a program named  <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">busyBusy</FONT></TT>
by performing just those compilations and linking operations that
are necessary when any of the three source files are edited.
<P>
5. Tell what the <I>ci</I> and <I>co</I> commands do, and tell
what the <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">-l</FONT></TT> command
line option does with <I>co</I>.
<P>
6. Assume you wrote a function named <I>readMsg()</I> that contains
the statement,<BR>
 <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">numBytes = read(skt, &amp;msgBuf,
sizeof(msgBuf));<BR>
</FONT></TT>Give the sequence of <I>gdb</I> commands that you
would use to examine the value of numBytes and the contents of
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">msgBuf</FONT></TT> after this
call to <I>read()</I>.  If you prefer, you may tell how you would
do this using  <I>ddd</I> instead.  There is not enough time to
single step through the whole program to get to this statement.
<P>
7. The behavior of <I>read()</I> is different depending on whether
it is reading from a terminal, a disk file, or a stream socket.
 Tell what these differences are, including how long the process
might block and how to interpret the value returned by <I>read().</I>
<P>
8. Tell what &quot;network byte order&quot; refers to and what
functions a distributed application must use to deal with it.
 Be specific about the circumstances in which the functions must
be used.
<P>
9. What must the kernel do when it performs a context switch between
two processes?  How does this differ from what it must do to switch
between two threads running in the same process?<BR>
