<h2><a NAME="q0">Hey, what's all this junk in my new account?</a></h2>

The proper form of this question is, "Golly, Dr. Vickery, what are all
these interesting files and directories that you have set up for me in
my new account?"<P>

Well, since you asked so nicely, I'll tell you.  First of all, you will
notice that you have directories named <code>Mail</code>, <code>bin</code>,
<code>lib</code>, and <code>man</code>.  The <code>Mail</code> directory
is discussed in <a HREF="#q3">How do I organize my mail messages?</a>.
The other three directories are for your own personal versions of
the corresponding directories in the system's <code>/usr</code> directory.
You can put executable files that you develop into your <code>bin</code>
directory, libraries that you build into your <code>lib</code> directory,
and <i>man</i> pages under your <code>man</code> directory.  You can then
use the files you developed just as if they had been provided by the system.
The idea is to give you practice in installing programming projects without
giving you superuser access to the real system-wide directories.<P>

There is also a read-only copy of a file named <code>Makefile</code> in
your home directory.  Each project you do will go in its own project
directory, and the first thing you will do after creating the directory
is to copy this file into it.  Then you can edit the copy as necessary
to adapt it to the particular project you are working on.  The copy in
your home directory is read-only so that you don't accidently change it.
You will have to change permissions using the <i>chmod</i> command before
you can edit the copies you make of it.<P>

There are a few hidden files in your home directory that I put there, and
several more that will show up as you run various programs like <i>pine</i>
and <i>netscape</i>.  The files that I put there are editable by you, but
I suggest that you make a copy of each one before making changes to it,
just in case.  Here is a list of the files I put there and what they do:

<dl>
<dt><code>.cshrc</code><dd>This is the file you are most likely to want to
edit yourself.  It contains the commands that the shell executes when you
first log in or start a new copy of the shell running.  Note that we are
using the <i>tcsh</i>, so the commnds here are specific to that shell.  There
are many environment variables set here, and some command aliases are defined
here.  Your idea of good aliases for commands might not agree with mine, so
here is a list of aliases that I set up and what they do:

<dl>
<dt>.<dd>Show the pathname of your current working directory.
<dt>..<dd>Change to the directory above the one you are in.
<dt>cls<dd>Clear the screen.
<dt>del<dd>Delete files, prompt for confirmation.
<dt>dir<dd>Same as <i>ls</i>.
<dt>ff<dd>Find File.  First argument is the top of a directory tree,
the second is a filename, which may include wildcards if you put it
in quotes.
<dt>h<dd>Display the command-line history list.
<dt>ispell<dd>Spell-check a file.
<dt>j<dd>List jobs that are running in the background.
<dt>ker<dd>Run Kermit
<dt>l<dd>List file names, permissions, and sizes a screenful at a time.
<dt>la<dd>List all file names, etc. including hidden files.
<dt>log<dd>Clear the screen and exit the shell.
<dt>ls<dd>List file names with the "<code>-F</code>" option, which means
that directory names will have a '<code>/</code>' after them and that
executable file names will have an '<code>*</code>' after them. <i>Note:</i>
the way aliases are set up, this option applies to the other aliases that
are based on this one, <i>l</i> and <i>la</i>.
<dt>m<dd>It stands for "more" but it is an alias for <i>less</i>.  This
is the program that lets you view text a screenful at a time.
<dt>mail<dd>Run the <i>pine</i> email program.
<dt>md<dd>Create a directory.
<dt>mk<dd>Run the <i>make</i> utility.
<dt>mv<dd>Rename a file or directory, asking for confirmation if the
target file already exists.
<dt>q<dd>Same as <i>log</i>.
<dt>type<dd>Same as <i>less</i>.
<dt>uuencode<dd>Simplified version of the <i>uuencode</i> command.  Give
the name of the file to uuencode, and it produces a new file with the
same name plus an extension of <code>.uue</code>.
<dt>vt100<dd>If you have trouble running <i>vi</i> or <i>pine</i> with
messages to the effect that they don't know about the terminal you are
using, try giving this command.

</dl>

<dt>.login<dd>The commands in this file are executed by the shell
when you log into the system.  I don't think you will need to change it.
<dt>.Xdefaults<dd>This is the resource file that is loaded into the X
Window Server when you log in.  We have to find out how CDE handles this
one.

<dt>.pinerc<dd>This is your <i>pine</i> options file.  You can edit it
directly, but it is much better to use the "Setup/Config" options from
Pine's "Main" menu instead.

<h2><a NAME="q1">How do I print Web pages from Netscape?</a></h2>

You can't use Netscape's "print" option because it generates PostScript
output and the printer in the lab doesn't recognize PostScript.
Instead, select "Save as ..." from the File menu.  When the Save As ...
dialog box pops up, use the Format for Saved Document drop down menu to
select the "Text" option.  You can then print the text file on the
printer in the lab.  Alternatively, you could save the document in
PostScript form, take the file somewhere else and print it on a
PostScript printer.<p>

<ul>

</ul>

<h2><a NAME="q2">How do I print mail messages?</a></h2>

Type 'y' when the message is selected and it will print on the
dot-matrix printer in the lab.  Alternatively, you can type 'e' to save
the message in a file, and print the file.<P>

<ul>
<li><a HREF="#questions">Back to the Questions</a>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="q3">How do I organize mail messages?</a></h2>

Your ~/Mail directory is used for saving mail messages.  All mail
messages to you are stored in your "incoming mailbox," which is a file named
<code>/var/mail/&lt;your_name&gt;</code>.  At any time, you can save
messages in a "folder" by using the 's' command.  The advantage of
moving messages to folders is that they no longer clutter up your list
of messages when you start up pine; only the messages you haven't saved
yet (the ones still in your inbox) will be listed.  Also, you can have
different folders for different types of mail if you want.  You can
always get to the messages you have put in a folder by using the 'g'
command to change folders.<p>

<b>Note:</b>  Mail messages left in your incoming mailbox are subject
to random deletion!  On the other hand, all files in your directory
tree (including, of course, your Mail subdirectory) are backed up twice
a week.  If you care about your mail, save it in folders.<P>

</ul>

<h2><a NAME="q4">How do I use a floppy disk?</a></h2>

Insert a DOS-formatted diskette into the drive, and run the
<i>volcheck</i> command.  When it completes, you will be able to copy
files to/from the floppy by referring to the Unix directory
/floppy/floppy0 as the root directory of the diskette.  When you are
finished, use the <i>eject</i> command to get the diskette out of the
drive.  <i>Note:</i> The <i>eject</i> command if your current working
directory is on the floppy.  Be sure to <code>cd</code> back to your
home directory before you try to eject a floppy.<p>

As an alternative, you can use the CDE's FileManager application.  There
is a option under the File menu that says "Check for floppy."  When you
select it, it does the <i>volcheck</i> command for you and brings up
a window for the floppy which can be used in the FileManager's usual sort
of way.  Note that I consider the use of FileManager to be a good idea in
the outside world, but <i>not in this course</i>.<P>

<ul>
<li><a HREF="#questions">Back to the Questions</a>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="q5">Why does every line of my program have
<code>^M</code> at the end?</a></h2>

If you use a DOS editor to create a text file and bring that file into
the lab on a floppy, the <code>^M</code> characters show up.  They are
ASCII carriage returns, put there by the DOS editor because DOS uses
the convention that every line of a text file ends with both a carriage
return and a linefeed.  The Unix convention is to terminate lines with
just a linefeed.  The ASCII code for carriage return is 0x0D (decimal
13) which looks to a Unix editor like Control-M (because M is the 13th
letter of the alphabet), and displays as <code>^M</code>.  The presence
or absence of carriage returns is normally immaterial to C compilers
and text editors.  You can get rid of them in <i>vi</i> with this
command sequence:  "<code>:%/^V^M//</code>" where <code>^V</code>
means to type Control-V and <code>^M</code> means to type Control-M.
At the bottom of the screen you will see just the <code>^</code> when
you type the <code>^V</code> and the <code>M</code> when you type
<code>^M</code>.<p>

<h2><a name="q9">Help! I got a "quota exceeded" message!</a></h2>

You have a disk quota of 15 MB.  Once you exceed it, you will have to
delete some files before you can do much of anything else.  This is a
big chunk of file space to use up, so you probably have downloaded a
bunch of stuff from the net, and you will have to get rid of
something.  A painless way to start is to tell <i>netscape</i> to clean
out its cache and to set its cache size to zero.  (It's under the
"Options" menu.)<P>


<ul>
<li><a HREF="#questions">Back to the Questions</a>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="q6">Help! The mouse stopped working!</a></h2>

The SPARCstations in the lab have a key called "<code>Alt Graph</code>"
in the lower right corner of the main part of the keyboard which, when
pressed, causes the mouse buttons to stop working.  It's easy to hit it
accidentally without realizing it.  If you can move the mouse cursor
but the buttons have no effect, try pressing this key; it works as a
toggle, and pressing it again normally clears the problem.<p>

<ul>
<li><a HREF="#questions">Back to the Questions</a><p>
</ul>

<h2><a NAME="q7">Help! Something's wrong with the printer!</a></h2>

<ol>

<li>  If you print something and it does not come out, <b>do not repeat
      the <i>lp</i> command!</b>  If the file does not print, there must be
      something wrong, and repeating the command just queues up more
      copies to be printed, which will tie up the printer with wasted
      work when the problem is resolved.

<li>  Be very careful about what you are printing.  Printing anything
      more than a few pages at a time is inappropriate.  If you want
      printed copies of long <i>man(1)</i> pages, redirect the output to
      a file, copy the file to a diskette, and print the file on one
      of the laser printers supplied by the Academic Computer Center.

<li>  Be careful to print only plain text files.  Anything else will
      cause problems.  It's not a good idea to use wildcards when
      listing files to print because it is so easy to include binary
      files inadvertently.

<li>  <b>Never leave the lab with a print job pending.</b>  See the
      next item for how to cancel a print job.  If you are unable to
      cancel a print job successfully, send email to <i>vickery,
      joshi at wizard,</i> or <i>peter at wizard.</i>  Note that the printer
      has an internal buffer, and it may continue to print for a while
      after you cancel a print job.  If you print a binary file, it
      might fill up the print buffer with formfeed codes, causing lots
      of pages to come out after you cancel the print job.  <A
      HREF="#power">See below</A>.

<li>  Become familiar with the commands for cancelling print jobs and
      determining the status of jobs you have submitted for printing:

<dl>

<dt><code>cancel <i>&ltrequest-id&gt</i></code><dd>Cancels a print
job.  The request-id was displayed when the lp command was given.

<dt><code>lpstat</code><dd>Shows the <i>&ltrequest-id&gt</i> and status
of all print jobs you have submitted but which have not completed
printing yet.

<dt><code>lpstat -o</code><dd>List the status of all output requests to
the printer.

<dt><code>lpstat -u</code><dd>List the status of all users' print
requests.  In our lab, this and the previous command give the same
information.

</dl>
</ol>

<A NAME="power"><b>To Stop Printing a Binary File</b></A><P>
If you do print a binary file and canceling the print job leaves you with
pages spewing out of the printer because of control codes in the print
buffer, you have no choice but to turn the power to the printer off, which
clears the print buffer.  Position the paper to the top of a page before
turning the printer back on.<P>

<h2><a NAME="q8">Help! The workstation died!</a></h2>

First, be sure you are not dealing with the <a HREF=#q6>mouse
buttons don't work</a> problem.  Be sure you have tried ^C to kill
whatever program you are running.  If you can exit the window system
(which logs you out), do so.  Then log back in and use <code>ps -fe |
grep <i>&ltyour_account&gt</i></code> to see all processes that you
have running on the workstation.  Use <code>kill
<i>&ltprocess_id&gt</i></code> to delete all processes not related to your
current login session.  If you kill a process and it doesn't go away,
try using <code>-KILL</code> or <code>-TERM</code> as an argument to the
<i>kill</i> command (before the <i>&ltprocess_id&gt</i>.)  If you can't
log out and/or you can't log back in, try logging in to the problem
computer from another one using <i>rlogin</i> and killing the problem
processes from there.  See <a href="#q11">Lost Phone Connection</a> for more
information on killing processes.<p>

If none of these strategies works, send mail to <i>vickery,
joshi at wizard,</i> and/or <i>peter at wizard</i> telling about the problem,
and one of us will deal with it as soon as possible.<p>

<i>Never try to reboot any of the workstations, and <b>never, never
turn off the power to any of the workstations!</b></i><p>

<ul>
<li><a HREF="#questions">Back to the Questions</a><p>
</ul>

<h2><a name="q10">Help! I accidentally deleted a file!</a></h2>

Unfortunately, there is no way to "undelete" a file once it is deleted.
For this reason, it is critical for you to back up your work manually
as often as you make enough changes that you wouldn't want to have
to type things back in again.  If you are in the lab, you can copy
your work onto a floppy disk.  See <a href="#q4">How to Use a Floppy</a>
above for instructions.  If you are home, you will have to download your
modified files using whatever communication program you have.<p>

An easy way to guard against accidental deletions is to copy your project
directory into a backup directory in your account periodically.  The
<code>-r</code> option of the <i>cp</i> command lets you copy a whole
tree with one command.  Of course, this doesn't protect you if the whole
disk crashes.<p>

Finally, the files in the lab are backed up to magnetic tape twice a
week.  You can contact either <i>peter@wizard</i> or <i>joshi@wizard</i>
to request a file to be restored from the most recent backup tape.  Backup
days are Monday and Thursday.<p>

<ul>
<li><a HREF="#questions">Back to the Questions</a>
</ul>
 
<h2><a name="q11">What happens if my phone connection goes down?</a></h2>

After a while you will be logged out automatically.  If you were editing
a file using <i>vi</i> you will get an email message from the editor
telling you how you can recover the editing session you were in when the
connection broke.<p>

Even though you may be officially logged in for a while after your
connection breaks, neither you nor anyone else will be able to access
that login session.  You can log back in and start another login
session though.<p>

Sometimes recovery is not so clean as I just indicated.  When you log back
into the same computer again, it is a good idea to look for processes that
are still running from an earlier session and try to delete them.  You
might want to do this if you were in the middle of editing a file when
the connection went down: killing the <i>vi</i> process will get it to
set up for you to recover the editing session.<p>

The command to look at the processes that are running on the system is
<i>ps</i>.  If you type <i>ps</i> with <code>-fe</code> as command line
arguments, your get a list of all the processes running on the system
that starts like this:

<pre>
     UID   PID  PPID  C    STIME TTY        TIME COMD
    root     0     0 73   Feb 13 ?          0:01 sched
    root     1     0 80   Feb 13 ?          5:34 /etc/init -
    root     2     0 80   Feb 13 ?          0:03 pageout
    root     3     0 80   Feb 13 ?         44:04 fsflush
</pre>

The <code>UID</code> column tells you which user started the process,
the <code>PID</code> column tells the Process ID#, the <code>PPID</code>
is the parent process ID, <code>STIME</code> is when the process started,
<code>TTY</code> is the terminal from which the process was started,
<code>TIME</code> is the amount of execution time the process has
consumed, and <code>COMD</code> is the command line that started the
process.<p>

The task is to determine the <code>PID</code> of the process(es) you
want to get rid of.  They should have your login name as
<code>UID</code> and should have a <code>TTY</code> that is different
from the one you are currently logged in on.  Look at this command and
its output:

<pre>
vickery at babbage[~]> ps -fe | grep grep
 vickery 14278   310  5 12:59:22 pts/3      0:00 grep grep
vickery at babbage[~]> 
</pre>

It says that my process number 14278 (child of 310) is running from
terminal "pts/3" and that it is executing a "grep grep" command.  If I
am logged in from a terminal, I can now do "<code>ps -fe | grep
vickery</code>" to see all the processes I am running and kill any that
are <i>not</i> running from <code>pts/3</code>.  If I am logged in at
the console, I will be logged in once for every application that I am
running, and I will have to be careful to determine which processes I
want to kill.  However if I am not careful enough, the worst that will
happen is that I will kill an application I am running or maybe even
log myself out.<p>

The command to delete a process is <i>kill -KILL</i> with the
<code>PID</code>(s) you want to kill listed as command line
arguments.<p>
