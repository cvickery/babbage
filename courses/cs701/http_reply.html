Subject: http reply format

@(#)http_reply.msg	1.2  15 Nov 1994

Class --

So far we have discussed the request messages that clients send to a
WWW server.  Here we look at the replies the server might generate in
response to a client.  My sample server illustrates a very simple
design:  No matter what the client requests, it returns the contents of
a file.  The next level of sophisitication would be for the server to
return the particular file requested by the client, and to indicate
failure if the named file cannot be found.  To add the ability to
indicate failure takes us into another feature of the http protocol,
the notion of a server's reply being divided into two parts, a header
and a body, which are separated by a blank line.  The header part
contains information about the body part, such a any error that
occurred in making the reply, the size of the reply if the request was
satisfied, etc.

In this context, my current server returns only the body part
of a reply and is "non-conformant" in that it does not terminate its
(missing) header with a blank line.  Both Lynx and Mosaic seem to be
able to deal with this non-conformant server without problems.

To make things concrete, here is the header and the first few lines
returned by the NCSA server for a request to URL
"http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/demoweb/demo.html#exper" (The #exper part
identifies a link within the document, and is optional.).

I have bracketed the response with lines of ===, and I have added line
numbers in brackets for reference purposes.  Everything that lines up
with the 'H' in HTTP on the first line was in the first column of the
reply.

[13]   Welcome to NCSA Mosaic, an information browser developed at the National
[14]   Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois,
[15]   Urbana-Champaign.  
[16]   This document is an interactive hypermedia tour of Mosaic's
[17]   capabilities. 
[18]
[19]   <P>
[20]   <B>Disclaimer:</B> 
[21]   <I>This tour assumes that you have good network
[22]   connectivity, that you have properly installed Mosaic and appropriate
[23]   external viewers, and that the various information servers (at NCSA and
[24]   elsewhere) the document references are alive and functioning well.</I> 
[25]   <P>
[26]   Every time you see this icon:

[28]   you can click on it to hear an audio clip narrating the

There are 600+ more lines in this particular "page," but this is enough for
present purposes.

Lines 1-7 are the header for this message, and lines 9 through the end are
the body.  Properly speaking, the body of this message contains an HTML
document which has its own header and body.  (Line 9 is the header, and
lines 10 through the end are the body.)  We will not be concerned with
HTML document contents until the second part of this project.

HTTP headers are a superset of MIME headers, which are a superset of RFC-822
headers.  RFC-822 is the name of a document written by David H. Crocker of
The University of Delaware in 1982 that specifies the format of Internet
text messages (email).   MIME is the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions,
also known as RFC-1341.  This document was written by Nathaniel S. Borenstein
of Bellcore and Ned Freed of Innosoft International in June of 1992.  It
"redefines the format of message bodies to allow multi-part textual and
non-textual message bodies to be represented and exchanged without loss of
information."  In addition to redefining the content of email message
bodies, it adds some new header line types to those defined in RFC-822.

The idea appears to be that where HTTP needs to represent the same kinds
of information as email or MIME messages, it uses RFC-822 and RFC-1341
header lines.  Where HTTP needs to represent some different type of
information, it defines its own types of header lines.  That is, an HTTP
message does not look just like a MIME or an email message, but it shares
features with both.

In the sample message, lines 1 and 3 are HTTP lines, line 2 is an RFC-822
line, and the remainder are MIME lines.

Line 1 is the server's status report.  It tells the version of the HTTP
protocol being used, a numeric code, and a message telling what the code
number means.  Here is a list of code numbers and their meanings:

	200 OK
	201 CREATED Indicates that a POST command succeeded
	202 ACCEPTED Indicates that a request was accepted, but that
	    the response will come later.
	203 PARTIAL INFORMATION Indicates that the information is not
	    "definitive."

	301 - 303  Various codes indicating the information requested
	    has moved or should be accessed using a different method.

	400 BAD REQUEST Indicates that the request was syntactically
	    wrong.
	401 UNAUTHORIZED Indicates the item requested requires the request
	    to contain an Authorization: line, which was either missing
	    or contained the wrong information.
	402 PAYMENT REQUIRED
	403 FORBIDDEN -- Authorization will not help.
	404 NOT FOUND Means the server can't find the item requested.

	500 INTERNAL ERROR
	501 NOT IMPLEMENTED

I believe that the other header lines are self-explanatory.  Note that some
browsers use the Content-length line to tell the user what progress is
being made in retrieving the document by displaying a line that says
something like "Received 12345 of 54321 bytes."
