I will be updating the course schedule web page with this information,
but want to send it out now by email to be sure everyone gets the
information right away:

  The midterm exam will be next Thursday, April 11.  You should have
  completed virtually all of Assignment 3 by then, because the exam
  will be based on the material covered by doing that assignment.

  In particular, you will be responsibile for material on the
  following web pages:

    Coding Guidelines
      Writeable Strings (linked from Coding Guidelines)
    Using RCS
      RCS Keywords (linked from Using RCS
    Using Make
      Skeleton Makefile (linked from Using Make)
      Make Implicit Rules (linked from Using Make)

  We have also covered material from the following chapters in the
  Stevens text:

    Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.  I haven't talked about chapter 10
    (signals) in class yet, so that won't be on the exam.  This is the
    part of Assignment 3 that I plan to go over in class on 4/14.

    You don't have to memorize this material: concentrate on the parts
    we have gone over in class and/or are needed for the assignments.

  There has been no reading assignment relating to network
  interprocess communication, so you have only the web page for
  Assignment 3 and your class notes to relay on for that.

  I hope this helps you prepare for the midterm,
  Dr. Vickery
