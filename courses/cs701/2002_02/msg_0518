I have updated the web page for Assignment 4.  Let me know if you find
any problems with it.

As promised, it includes links to my source code, which you may use to
help prepare for the final exam.  But beware: I have not had time to
test it fully yet, and I know there are problems with it.  It seems
okay when the client and server run on the same machine, but there are
definitely problems going from one machine to another.  Unfortunately,
I have to go out of town Sunday morning and won't be back until
Tuesday afternoon, so I can't fix it up now.  But the code is
basically correct, and you can use it to help prepare for the final.

The final exam will be a mix of short answer questions and coding
questions.  

The short answer questions will cover the use of gdb and concepts
behind management of sockets, processes, pipes, signals; command
execution; environment variables; the poll() function; I/O
redirection; use of the Standard Template Library (STL).  

I'll try not to make the coding problem(s) too interesting!  You
should be able to write a program that executes an external command
and prints its exit code.  You should be able to set up and use a
dispatch table as described in class, in the Assignment 4 web page,
and as illustrated in my process_command.cc.  You should be able to
write code that uses the fork() kernel call.

Good luck!
Dr. Vickery
