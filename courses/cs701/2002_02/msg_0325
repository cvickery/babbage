I have updated the web page for Assignment 3, but there is still more
material to come.

I have also updated the Using Make web page
(http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/using_make.html) and
several of the web pages it is linked to, and I suggest that you look
this material over before the midterm and early in your work on
Assignment 3.

So far as I can tell, lnx0006 is still down, with no word of when it
might be available again.  But Spinoza is looking good.
