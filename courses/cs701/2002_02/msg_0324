Everyone now has an account on another linux machine,
spinoza.oit.qc.edu, in addition to lnx0006.uneb.edu.  Your account
name is the same on both computers, but I was unable to access lnx0006
this weekend, so I gave you an initial password of "Cs-701"
(capitalized like that, but without the quotes).  Please log on
immediately and change your password to something secure.

Spinoza is a "Slackware" distribution of Linux instead of "Red Hat,"
but I don't think you will notice any significant differences from
other Linux distributions.  The one difference you might notice is
that your home directory is under /usr/users instead of /home.

You can send email both into and out of spinoza!

I think you will find this computer more responsive than lnx0006.  (At
least it's running this weekend, whereas lnx0006 is not!)  We have
Eric Shamow of OIT to thank for offering us the use of this machine.
(Thank you, Eric!!) Eric asks us not to use too much disk space --
there is plenty for our purposes, but please don't transfer large
files there, such as your favorite video or audio files.

I'm still working on the web page for Assignment 3, but the first part
of it is up now so you can get started.  I'll post more material as
quickly as possible.
