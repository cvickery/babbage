This is the first of what will be a series of group email messages I
will be sending to CS-701 students this semester.  Although it appears
to be addressed directly to you (your name should appear above), it is
actually a single message that is going out to each email address
people sent to me for Assignment 1.

I have updated the web pages for CS-701 for this semester.  The
complete schedule is not ready yet, but there are instructions to get
you started on Assignment 2 available.  The Assignment 2 web page will
be updated to include an assignment due date  sometime later this
week.

Also, you should be able to click on the link to check your grades to
verify that you can access your grades for the course successfully.
