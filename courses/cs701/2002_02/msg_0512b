There are executable copies of my current versions of qserver and
qclient in ~vickery/bin on both spinoza and lnx0006.  A good way to
see what is going on is to log in multiple times (to either machine)
and run the server in one window and client(s) in other window(s).
Run the server in the background (put & at the end of the command
line), and you can monitor the log file as the server writes to it
using the following command:

  tail -f qserver.log

The tail command shows you the last n lines (10 by default); the -f
option tells tail to "follow" the file.  That is, instead of exiting,
it displays new lines as they get written to it.  Type Control-C to
exit the tail command.

My server recognizes exit, shut, and echo commands, but no external
commands so far.  And so far, manager processes don't send SC_SHUT
messages to clients; they just get killed when the server shuts down.

Hope this helps,
Dr. Vickery
