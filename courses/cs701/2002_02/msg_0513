Eric, who has provided us with the use of spinoza this semester, has a
fairly urgent request:

  Please do not use any port number below 32768 (0x8000) when testing
  your programs.  Using any ports between 1,024 and 32,767 can cause
  security problems and/or affect normal operation of the machine.

  Just for an example: ports 6000 through 6003 are used by the X
  Window system.
