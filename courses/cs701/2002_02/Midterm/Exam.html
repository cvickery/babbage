<h1>Midterm Exam Answers</h1>
</center>
<h2>Question 1</h2>

(20 points) Consider the following command:

<pre>
  g++ -g -Wall -Wwrite-strings -Ddebug main.cc sub.o -o q1
</pre>

Tell what the command name is. Tell what each command line option does.
Tell what programs will be run, and what the inputs and outputs of each
program will be.<p>

<b>Answer: </b>The command name is <i>g++</i>.  The -g option causes
the compiler to add information for a debugger to the output files. 
The -Wall option causes the compiler to print <i>all</i> warning
messages.  The -Wwrite-strings options causes the compiler to print
warning messages if literal strings are not handled as constants.  The
-Ddebug option defines the symbol "debug" for the preprocessor.  The
preprocessor will read main.cc, interpret all preprocessor directives
and macro references, remove all comments, and write source code to
<i>stdout</i>.  The compiler will read the output of the preprocessor
from <i>stdin</i>, and will write an assembly language program to
main.s.  The assembler will read main.s and generate main.o.  The
linker will link main.o, sub.o, and the standard runtime library to
produce the executable file, q1.  The compiler driver will delete
main.s and main.o (but not sub.o).

<h2>Question 2</h2>

(20 points) Tell how to set up a project directory so it has a properly
named subdirectory for an RCS database.  Tell how to add files to the
RCS database for a project.  Tell the names and options for commands
used to obtain read-only and read-write copies of files from the RCS
database for a project.  Tell how to enter a new version of a file into
the RCS database for a project.  Tell the names, contents, and
permissions of the files in the RCS database for a project.  Tell how
to use RCS keywords in files that are under RCS management.<p>

<b>Answer: </b>

Use the <i>mkdir</i> command to create a subdirectory named RCS.  Add
files to the database using the <i>ci</i> command, providing a
description of each file's role in the project when prompted.  Use the
<i>co</i> command with no options (except the file names) to get
read-only copies of files from the database.  Use the <i>co</i> command
with the -l ("el") option to lock files for editing; that is, to get
writeable copies of the files.  Use the <i>ci</i> command to enter a new
version of a file into the RCS database for a project; provide a log
message that tells what changes were made when prompted.  Files in the
RCS subdirectory have the same names as the files in the project
directory, but with ",v" appended to the end of each file name.  Files
in the database are read-only.  They contain housekeeping information,
the full text of the most recent version of the file, and a record of
all the differences between the current version and each previous
version of the file.  Use the $Id$ keyword in a comment at the beginning
of each file to show the name of the file and its status.  Use the $Log$
keyword in the comment block at the beginning of each file to show the
history of changes that were made to the file.

<h2>Question 3</h2>

(20 points) Answer the following questions about the <i>make</i>
processor and Makefiles.

<pre>
  A.  What is significant about tab characters?
  B.  Can the <i>make</i> command be used without a Makefile?  If not,
      explain why not, and if yes, tell when.
  C.  What is a rule, and what is the difference between an
      implicit and an explicit rule?  Give an example of both.
  D.  In the skeleton makefile I provided, there are references to the
      symbols CXXFLAGS and OBJS.  In what way are these two symbols
      similar?  What is the significant difference between them? 
      (<i>Hint: one of them will be used automatically in certain
      circumstances, but the other one will never be used
      automatically.</i>)
  E.  The skeleton makefile contains the line,
  
        depend : $(SRCS) $(HDRS).  
      
      Tell everything make would do because of this line, assuming the
      user types the command, "make depend".
  F.  What is the difference between the commands, "make&nbsp;depend"
      and "makedepend"?
</pre>

<b>Answer:</b><p>

A.  You have to start each command line in a rule with a tab character
because <i>make</i> recognizes the end of the command list by seening a
line that does not start with a tab character.<p>

B.  Yes it can.  If you have a single source module, such as myprog.cc,
you can type "make myprog" and <i>make</i> will use one of its implicit
rules to generate the appropriate command to compile and link the
program.<p>

C.  A rule consists of a <i>target</i> followed by a colon (:),
optionally followed by a list of <i>dependencies</i> on one line.  The
first line may be followed by any number of command lines, each of which
must start with a tab character.  An implicit rule is one that is built
into <i>make</i> and will be used automatically based on filename
endings.  An explicit rule is one specified in a Makefile.<p>

D.  They are both <i>make</i> variable names.  But CXXFLAGS is
automatically used by <i>make</i> when it generates compilation commands
using its implicit rules, whereas OBJS is used only when written into
explicit rules.  (It's all right to use CXXFLAGS in explicit rules,
too.)<p>

E.  It expands the variable SRCS to whatever its value is, which is probably
a list of source files.  If these files are not already present in the
project directory, use an implicit rule to check them out of the RCS
database if possible.  Then expand HDRS, and if these files are not
already present in the project directory, use an implicit rule to check
them out of the RCS database if possible.<p>

F.  The command "make&nbsp;depend" causes the "depend" rule in the
Makefile to be processed (after checking out the Makefile if necessary).
The depend rule has a <i>makedepend</i> command in its command list,
which gets executed after the dependency part of the rule is processed. 
The <i>makedepend</i> command updates the Makefile with the header file
dependencies for all the .o files that would be generated by compiling
all of the source files given as command line arguments to the command.

<h2>Question 4</h2>

(40 points) Write a complete C++ program named <i>midterm</i> that implements
the following requirements:<p>

The program is to read lines from a set of input files whose names are
specified on the command line. The input files are assumed to contain
lines of text. If an input file cannot be read, print an appropriate
error message that includes the file name, and continue on to process
the next input file. Exit when all input files have been read.<p>

For each input file, the program  is to write a message to an output
file that tells the name of the input file and how many lines of text
it contained. The default name of the output file is midterm.out, but
the user can change this name using the "-o" or "--outfile" command
line option (which must be followed by a file name argument). The
output file is to be overwritten if it already exists, unless the user
specifies the "-a" or "--append" command line  option (which takes no
argument), in which case messages are to be appended to the file.<p>

If the user specifies "-?" or "--help" on the command line,
the program prints a meaningful error message and exits with a status
code of 1. Handle invalid command line options in the usual way.<p>

You may write your program as a single source module if you want to.
You may implement the entire program in <i>main()</i> if you want to.
But you are free to use additional modules and functions if you prefer.
Comment your code according to the coding guidelines for this course,
except you may reduce the file header(s) and function header(s) to a
single summary sentence each. But do include all RCS keywords in the
proper places. Do not provide a Makefile.<p>
