<h1>Midterm Exam Topics</h1>
</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

  The midterm exam will be Thursday, April 11.  You should have
  completed virtually all of <a
  href="./Assignments/Assignment_03.html">Assignment 3</a> by then,
  because the exam will be based on the material covered by doing that
  assignment.

<h2>Material Covered</h2>

  You will be responsibile for material on the following web pages:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</a>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/writeable_strings.html">Writeable Strings</a> (linked from Coding Guidelines)
  </ul>
    <li><a
    href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/using_rcs.html">Using RCS</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/rcs_keywords.html">RCS Keywords</a> (linked from Using RCS
    </ul>
    <li><a
    href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/using_make.html">Using Make</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/skeleton_makefile.html">Skeleton Makefile</a> (linked from Using Make)
      <li><a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/make_implicit_rules.html">Make Implicit Rules</a> (linked from Using Make)
    </ul>   
</ul>

  We have also covered material from the following chapters in the
  Stevens text:

  <ul>
    <li>Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.  I haven't talked about chapter 10
    (signals) in class yet, so that won't be on the exam.  This is the
    part of Assignment 3 that I plan to go over in class on 4/14.

    <li>You don't have to memorize this material: concentrate on the parts
    we have gone over in class and/or are needed for the assignments.

    <li>There has been no reading assignment relating to network
    interprocess communication, so you have only the web page for
    Assignment 3 and your class notes to relay on for that.
  </ul>
