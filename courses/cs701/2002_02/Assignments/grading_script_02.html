      Contents of your Project Subdirectory
      =====================================

      Building your program:
      ======================
      
      $(make wc 2&gt;&1)
      
      Testing the program:
      =====================
      
      The grading program ran the following sequence of commands:
      
        $ /usr/bin/wc wc.cc nofile ../../boilerplate &gt; system.out 2&gt;&1
        $ ./wc wc.cc nofile ../../boilerplate &gt; student.out 2&gt;&1
        $ diff system.out student.out
        $ ./wc --li -L ../../grade  (Test normal option processing.)
        $ ./wc -x                   (Test invalid option processing.)
        $ ./wc -?                   (Test help option processing.)
        $ ./wc                      (Test reading from stdin.)
      
      The output of these commands appears below:
      
      Output of the diff command:  (Difference for nofile message is OK)
      
      !!!
      rm -f student.out system.out
      /usr/bin/wc wc.cc nofile ../../boilerplate &gt; system.out 2&gt;&1
      ./wc wc.cc nofile ../../boilerplate &gt; student.out 2&gt;&1
      diff system.out student.out &gt;&gt; $report 2&gt;&1
      
      cat &lt;&lt;!!! &gt;&gt; $report
      
      Output of the option processing tests:
      
      Following line should show 223 lines; longest is 70
      $(./wc --li -L ../../grade)
      
      Following lines should an show error message, followed by help.
      $(./wc -x 2&gt;&1)
      
      Following lines should show just your help message.
      $(./wc -? 2&gt;&1)
      
      Output of the stdin test (3 lines, 16 words, 89 chars):
      
      !!!
      ./wc &lt;&lt;!!! &gt;&gt; $report
      This is some test data being entered from stdin.
      It's just three lines long.
      That's all.
      !!!
      
      cat &lt;&lt;!!! &gt;&gt; $report
      
      End of program tests.
      =====================
      
        Did the program run correctly?
      
          Yes.
      
      
      Code Formatting and Coding Style:
      =================================
      
      $(chk_format *.cc)
      !!!
        chk_format *.cc &gt; /dev/null
        if [[ $? != 0 ]]
        then
          cat &lt;&lt;!!! &gt;&gt; $report
      *** There is at least one formatting error in your code.
          There should be NO tab characters and NO lines longer 
          than 72 characters.
      !!!
        else
          echo "    OK: No tabs and no long lines." &gt;&gt; $report
        fi
      
          cat &lt;&lt;!!! &gt;&gt; $report
