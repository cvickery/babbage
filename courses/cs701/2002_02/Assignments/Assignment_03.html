<h1>Remote Shell - Version 1</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This assignment will be the first in a series of assignments in which
you will develop a "remote shell" facility.  Your remote shell will be
based loosely on the <i>rsh</i> command that comes with most Unix
systems, but unlike your previous project for this course, your remote
shell will not attempt to mimic any existing command precisely.<p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The nominal goal of these assignments is to develop a facility that allows
users to enter command lines on one computer and to have them execute on
another computer.  To do this, you will need to implement two programs,
a <i>client</i>, which will read command lines typed by a user and pass
them on to a remote <i>server</i>, which will process each command line
and return the results to the client, which will display them on the
user's console.<p>

You will begin by developing the infrastructure for linking a client
and server, and then add functionality built on this infrastructure in
successive assignments.

<h3>Project Management</h3>

You are to use a single project directory for this assignment and all
following assignments in this course.  The Makefile and all source
files for the assignment are to be under RCS management as described in
the <a
href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/coding_guidelines.html">
Coding Guidelines</a> for the course.  There is a <a
href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/skeleton_makefile.html">
Skeleton Makefile</a> you may use as a starting point for using the
<i>make</i> command properly.<p>

<h2>This Assignment</h2>

This assignment is <b>Assignment 3</b> for the course.  All files you
submit for this assignment must have RCS revision numbers in the form
<b>1.xxx</b>, where <b>xxx</b> may be any number between 1 and 99.  But
the first two characters of the revision numbers must be "1.".<p>

For this assignment, you are to implement a server program to which
client programs can connect.  The server will recognize several command
line options, will manage a log file in which it will record its
activity, and will accept connections from clients.  But it will not
actually do anything having to do with its role as a command
processor yet.<p>

You will also implement a simple client program that you will be able to
use to test your server.<p>

<h2>The Server</h2>

The server is to be an executable file named <i>qserver</i>.  It is to
be built from at least the three source files listed below.  You may add
extra source files to the project if you wish.<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="80%">
  <tr>
    <th>File Name
    <th>Contents

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><code>qserver.h</code>

    <td valign=top>The header file included in all other source files
    used to build the <i>qserver</i> executable.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><code>qserver.cc</code>

    <td valign=top>Contains the <i>main()</i> function for the
    program.
    
    <br>(May also contain other functions, but does not have to.)

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><code>logfile.cc</code>

    <td valign=top>Contains the functions, <i>openLog()</i>,
    <i>writeLog()</i>, and <i>closeLog()</i> described <a
    href="#logfile">below</a>.
    
    <br>(May also contain other functions, but does not have to.)

</table></center><p>

The server is to recognize the following command line options:<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="80%">

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><b>-?</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>--help</b>

    <td valign=top>Displays a usage message and exits the program.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><b>-p</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>--port</b>

    <td valign=top>This option must be followed by an argument, the
    "well-known" port number, which the server will use for accepting
    connections.  The user may enter the port number as a decimal,
    octal, or hexadecimal constant using the syntax rules for numeric
    literals in C/C++.  If this option is not specified, the port
    number defaults to the last four digits of your social security
    number.  If the last four digits of your social security number has
    a decimal value less than 1024, add 1024 to it to get the default
    value for this parameter.<p>

    The server binds a socket to it's well-known port number, and uses
    this socket to accept connections from clients.  Port numbers
    between 0 and 1023 cannot be used unless the program is being run
    by the super user.  (Optional:  Let the super user specify bind to
    port numbers below 1024.)  Because port numbers are 16-bit unsigned
    numbers, the value entered by the user must be between 0 and 65,535
    (that is, between 0x0000 and 0xFFFF, which is between 00000 and
    0177777).<p>

    Use the standard library function <i>strtol()</i> to convert the
    user's command line argument from a string to a numeric port
    number.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><b>-l</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>--logfile</b>

    <td valign=top>The server will write messages to a file as it
    runs.  (<a href="#logfile">See below</a>.)  The argument for this
    option specifies the pathname for this file.  The default pathname
    is to be "./qserver.log".

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><b>-o</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>--overwrite</b>

    <td valign=top>This option does not take an argument.  If it is
    specified, the server is to overwrite the logfile, if it exists. 
    The default behavior is that the server will append messages to the
    logfile if it exists.  "The logfile" means the file that will be
    used for log messages during this invocation of the server.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><b>-v</b>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<b>--version</b>

    <td valign=top>This option is to cause the server to print a
    message of the form: "qserver: $&#82;evision 1.1 $".  The part of
    this message that is surrounded by dollar signs is to be produced
    using the $&#82;evision$ RCS keyword, so the number will be the
    actual revision number for your qserver.cc source file.  The server
    exits immediately after printing the message if this option is
    specified.

</table></center>


<h3><a name="logfile">The Log File</a></h3>

The server is to write a message to a log file each time a "significant"
event occurs.  Each message is to include the date and time at which the
event occurred, and information about what the event was.  The date and
time are to be in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" (4-digit year, 2
digit month, day, hour, minute, and seconds), which will be referred to
as a <i>timestamp</i>.<p>

You can determine the current time and date using the <i>time(2)</i>
kernel call, and you can create timestamp strings using the
<i>strftime(3)</i> function.  You can use the <i>localtime(3)</i>
function to convert the <i>time_t</i> value returned by <i>time(2)</i>
into a <i>struct tm *</i> required by <i>strftime(3)</i>.<p>

The table below gives the prototypes and requirements for the three
functions that are required to be defined in logfile.cc.<p>

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="80%">
  <tr>
    <th>Prototype
    <th>Description

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><pre>
int
openLog( const char *pathname,
         const char *msg,
         bool        overwrite );
</pre>

    <td valign=top>Open the log file at <i>pathname</i> for writing if
    possible. Open the file in append or overwrite mode depending on
    the value of <i>overwrite</i>.
    <br>Return -1 if the file cannot be opened.<p>

    If the log file was opened successfully, write two lines to it. 
    The first line is to be the current timestamp followed by the word
    "STARTUP."  The second line is to be the <i>msg</i> argument,
    indented four spaces (or an empty line if <i>msg</i> is a null
    pointer).  Return 0 if no errors occur.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><pre>
int
writeLog( const char *event_name,
          const char *msg );
</pre>

    <td valign=top>Return -1 if the log file has not been opened.

    <br>Otherwise, write two lines to the log file.  The first line is
    to be the current timestamp followed by the <i>event_name</i>
    string (or an empty string if <i>event_name</i> is a null
    pointer).  The second line is to be the <i>msg</i> argument,
    indented four spaces (or an empty line if <i>msg</i> is a null
    pointer).  Return 0 if no errors occur.

  <tr>
    <td valign=top><pre>
int
closeLog( const char *msg );
</pre>

    <td valign=top>Return -1 if the log file has not been opened.

    <br>Otherwise, write two lines to the log file.  The first line is
    to be the current timestamp followed by the word "SHUTDOWN."  The
    second line is to be the <i>msg</i> argument, indented four spaces
    (or blank line if <i>msg</i> is a null pointer).  Close the log
    file and return 0 if no errors occur.

</table></center><p>

<h3>Server Features</h3>

For this assignment, the server will act as an <i>iterative server</i>. 
That is, it will interact with just one client at a time.  The algorithm
for this version of the server is:

<ul>
  <li>Process command line arguments
  <li>Set up to accept connections on the well-known port
  <li>Open the log file
  <li>Wait for a client to connect.  When a client connects:
  <ul>

    <li>Write a message containing the connecting client's host name to
    the log file
    <li>Read whatever the client writes to the server, and write it to
    the log file as it arrives.  (See below for what the client does.)
    <li>When the client closes its end of the socket, the server closes
    its end and waits for another client to connect.    
  </ul>

  <li>The server is to continue running until it either receives a
  SIGINT signal, a SIGTERM signal, or a message from a client
  consisting only of the string, "SHUT" (four characters).  In any
  case, the server is to call <i>closeLog()</i> before exiting.  The
  argument to <i>closeLog()</i> is to be "Normal Shutdown" if a SHUT
  message is received from a client, or "Signal Received" if SIGINT is
  received.  How to manage this feature is covered in the <a
  href="#implement">How to Implement the Server</a> section below. 
  Process Termination is covered in Section 7.3 of the Stevens textbook,
  and signals are covered in Chapter 10.

</ul>

<h3><a name="implement">How to Implement the Server</a></h3>

Limited as its functionality is, the server uses many features of the
Unix kernel that we have not fully covered in class.  What follows are
guidelines for implementing these various features.  These guidelines
are presented as a sequence of development steps and "how-to"
information for each step.  After coding and testing a step carefully,
check in the file(s) you worked on so that each step will correspond to
a new RCS revision number for at least one source file.

<h4>Step 1.  Set up the project.</h4>

Create your Makefile, starting with the <a
href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/skeleton_makefile.html">
Skeleton Makefile</a>, qserver.h, qserver.cc, and logfile.cc.  Code the
<i>main()</i> function to process the command line arguments and print
a message giving the values of the options so you can be sure they are
being handled correctly.  Note that option processing is a bit harder
for this assignment than for the <i>wc</i> project because some of the
options take arguments.<p>

When you look at the Skeleton Makefile, you will see that it redefines
the CXXFLAGS variable to include the reference, $(DEBUG_FLAG).  The idea
behind doing this is that if DEBUG_FLAG is not set in your environment
when you run <i>make</i> to compile your code, this reference will have
no effect because undefined variables expand to nothing.  But if you set
this variable to -DDEBUG, either in your shell or on the <i>make</i>
command line, then the C Preprocessor will run with the symbol DEBUG
defined.  (You can type "DEBUG_FLAG=-DDEBUG make" to do this.)  For
example, to check the result of option processing, you could insert code
that looks like this in <i>main()</i>:

<pre>
#ifdef DEBUG
  printf( "Logfile: %s (%s)\n"
          "Port:    0x%04X (%d)\n",
          logfilePath, (overwriteLogfile ? "overwrite" : "append" ),
          wellKnownPort, wellKnownPort );
#endif
</pre>

By compiling with DEBUG set, you can test various combinations of
command line options and use the output printed by the code above to see
if they were handled correctly.  Once you are satisfied with those
tests, you can simply omit the -DDEBUG setting, and the above code will
effectively be removed from your program without any editing changes on
your part.  This is a somewhat crude use of conditional compilation
(What if you want to debug another part of the program and not see the
option processing output?), but you should become familiar with the
technique.<p>

<table align=center cellpadding=5 border=1 width=80%><tr><td>Don't lose
track of the fact that learning how to use the project management tools
(<i>make</i> and <i>rcs</i>) is a key goal of this assignment.  Use
this assignment to help make sure you are fully comfortable with these
tools.</table><p>

Assuming <i>lnx0006</i> and <i>spinoza</i> are both available, be sure
your code runs correctly on both systems before going on to the next
step.  (This rule applies to each step of the development process.)  Be
sure "make clean" leaves you with a clean project directory.  Be sure
you have run "make depend" before you check in your Makefile.  Be sure
"make" with no arguments builds <i>qserver</i> from a clean project
directory.  (The <i>make</i> command automatically checks out
everything it needs, including the Makefile, when there is an RCS
subdirectory.)

<h4>Step 2.  Implement the Log File Functions</h4>

Now remove the code that printed the results of command line processing
(or leave out the -DDEBUG setting if you followed the strategy
described above), and re-code <i>main()</i> so that it exercises the
log file functions by opening the log file, writing a message or two to
it (use "TESTING" as the event name and anything you like as the
messages), and closing it. You should use the <i>sleep(3)</i> function
so there is a delay of a few seconds between opening and closing the
log file to make sure the timestamp operations are working correctly.

<h4>Step 3.  Accept Connections From Clients.</h4>

In class, we went over the code to set up the server to wait for client
connections on its "well-known" socket.  Here is semi-pseudo code that does it:

<pre>
    gethostname( thisHostName, MAX_HOST_NAME );
    hp = gethostbyname( thisHostName );
    memset( &amp;server_sockaddr, 0, sizeof( server_sockaddr ) );
    server_sockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    memcpy( &amp;server_sockaddr.sin_addr, hp->h_addr_list[0], hp->h_length );
    server_sockaddr.sin_port = htons( wellKnownPort );
    server_fd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    bind(  server_fd,
           (struct sockaddr *) &amp;server_sockaddr,
            sizeof (server_sockaddr) );
    listen( server_fd, BACKLOG );
    socklen_t saSize = sizeof client_sockaddr;
    client_fd = accept( server_fd,
                    (struct sockaddr *) &amp;client_sockaddr, &amp;saSize );
</pre>

This is "semi-pseudo" code because it is real code, but several things
have been omitted: the proper header files, declaring most of the
variables, and error checking.  The <i>gethostname(), gethostbyname(),
socket(), bind(), listen(),</i> and <i>accept()</i> calls should all be
checked for success or failure, and the program should exit after
calling <i>perror()</i> if any of them fail.  (You test if
<code>hp</code> is a null pointer to check for an error after calling
<i>gethostbyname()</i>; all the other functions return an integer value
of -1 if they fail.)<p>

A way to test your server at this point is to use a <a
href="./Assignment_03/SampleClient.html">Sample Client</a> Java
application.  You can get copies of both the Java and class files from
~vickery/SampleClient.java and ~vickery/SampleClient.class on Spinoza. 
There is also an executable version of this version of the server
available at ~vickery/bin/qserver-1.1 on spinoza if you would like to
run it to make sure you understand what it is supposed to be doing.<p>

At this point, your server should accept a connection from a client,
write a message to its log file, and exit.  Check the log file to make
sure the connection message got written properly.<p>

If your server encounters any errors before it makes its first call to
<i>accept()</i>, it should write an error message to <i>stderr</i> and
call <i>exit()</i> with a status code of 1 (the standard value to use
when a program exits because of an error).  Once it is ready to accept
connections, it should open the log file, with the second argument to
the <i>openLog()</i> function being a string in the form:

<pre>
  qserver (<i>&lt;pid&gt;</i>) accepting connections at <i>&lt;host&gt;</i>:<i>&lt;port&gt;</i>
</pre>

In this string, <i>&lt;pid&gt;</i> is to be the process id for the
program, which you can get using the <i>getpid(2)</i> function. 
Substitute the computer's host name and the server's port number for
<i>&lt;host&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;port&gt;</i> respectively.<p>

You can use the following code to write connection messages to the log
file:

<pre>
    hp = gethostbyaddr( (const char *)&amp;client_sockaddr.sin_addr, 4, AF_INET );
    writeLog( "CONNECT", hp->h_name );
</pre>


<h4>Step 4.  Handle SIGINT and Normal Exit</h4>

There are three ways to stop the server:

<ol>
  <li>If the server is running in the foreground, and you type Control-C
  in the server's console window.  This will send an INT signal to the
  server.
  <li>If you give the command "kill <i>&lt;pid&gt;</i>" substituting the
  server's actual process id for <i>&lt;pid&gt;</i>.  This will send a
  TERM signal to the server.
  <li>If one of the clients writes a "SHUT" message to the server.
</ol>

In cases (1) and (2), the server is to call <i>closeLog()</i> with
"Signal Received" as the argument.  In case (3), the server is to call
<i>closeLog()</i> with "Normal Exit" as the argument.  The server
doesn't actually exit until after <i>closeLog()</i> has run.<p>

There are a number of ways you could meet these requirements, but I am
specifying the technique you are to use for this assignment as follows:

<ul>
    <li>Write a function definition that matches the following function
    prototype:
    <pre>
      void f(int, char *);</pre>

    Use a meaningful function name instead of "f".<p>
    
    This is the function that will be called just before the server
    exits, no matter which of the three events listed above was the
    cause for exiting.<p>

    The first argument to this function will be the status code used in
    a call to <i>exit()</i>.  We will arrange to use a special value
    for this argument if the program is exiting because of a signal. 
    The second argument is a string, which we will use as described
    next.<p>

    This function is to test the value of the first parameter.  If it
    is zero or above, call <i>closeLog()</i> passing the second input
    parameter as the argument to <i>closeLog()</i>.  If the first
    parameter is negative, call <i>closeLog()</i> with the string
    "Signal Received" as the argument.  (Optional: Put the signal number
    in the string, such as "Signal 2 Received.")<p>
    
    <li>Set up so that the function described above will be called when
    the program calls <i>exit()</i> using the GNU <i>on_exit()</i>
    function.  This function is not part of ANSI C/C++, thus making your
    program less portable than if you used the ANSI function
    <i>atexit()</i>.  But it is very valuable, and since the GNU C/C++
    runtime library is open source, its use seems justified here.  See
    the <i>man</i> page for how to code invoke <i>on_exit()</i>.  It
    should be called after the logfile has been opened and before the
    server starts accepting connections from clients.<p>
    
    <li>Write a function definition that matches the following function
    prototype:
    <pre>
      void f( int );</pre>

    Use a meaningful function name instead of "f".<p>
    
    This is the "signal handler" function that will be called whenever
    a TERM or INT signal is sent to the process.  It simply calls
    <i>exit()</i> with a status code of minus 1.  Calling <i>exit()</i>
    causes the function you registered using <i>on_exit()</i> to be
    called automatically before the process actually exits.  How to
    code that function was covered above.<p>

    <li>At the same time you call <i>on_exit()</i>, also call
    <i>signal()</i> two times, once so that your signal handler will
    be called for SIGINT, and once so it will be called for SIGTERM.

</ul>

Test your program to be sure that it exits cleanly, and with the proper
message written to the logfile, no matter which of the three events is
used to terminate the server.<p>

<h4>Step 5.   Reading From Clients</h4>

There are several functions that can be used to read and write to and
from sockets, but the basic ones are <i>read(2)</i> and <i>write(2)</i>.
As kernel calls, these functions incur quite a bit of overhead compared
to library functions, but using library functions with sockets adds its
own problems to client/server communication.  Two other kernel calls
that may be used with sockets are <i>recv(2)</i> and <i>send(2)</i>,
which are just like <i>read(2)</i> and <i>write(2)</i>, except that they
have another argument that can be used to set certain options for more
advanced operations.  We'll stay with the simpler read and write
functions for this project.<p>

The idea of a socket connection is that it is a full-duplex (two-way)
pipe connecting the client and server.  Whatever the client writes to
its end of the socket pair, the server can read from its end; likewise,
whatever the server writes to its end, the client can read from its
end. There is no way for the server to read what it has written, and
there is no way for the client to read what it has written.<p>

An important point to remember is that stream sockets are, as their
name implies, used to send <i>streams</i> of bytes between clients and
servers.  For example, depending on network conditions, the server
could receive a "SHUT" message with a single call to <i>read()</i> if
the client executed either of the following two sequences of function
calls:

<pre>
      write( fd, "SHUT", 4 );
</pre>
or
<pre>
      write( fd, "S",  1  );
      write( fd, "HU", 2  );
      write( fd, "T",  1  );
</pre>

We will deal with this issue in the next assignment, when we will adopt
a protocol so that the server client and server will be able to identify
the boundaries of the messages they send to each other.  For this
assignment, the server is simply to write whatever it reads to the log
file, and to exit if a single call to <i>read()</i> returns exactly the
four characters S-H-U-T.<p>

But in this assignment, you do need to convert the bytes you read into
strings so you can work with the text received using standard string
functions.  To do this, you need to append '\0' to the end of whatever
characters are read from the socket:

<pre>
      int numBytes = read( fd, buf, sizeof buf );
      buf[ numBytes ] = '\0';
</pre>

(Some people have been zeroing out the buffer using <i>memset()</i>
before each call to <i>read()</i>, which will work.  But doing that is
inefficient because it puts zeros in <i>all</i> the bytes of the buffer
instead of just the one byte where it is needed.)<p>

Once the server accepts a connection from a client, it enters an endless
loop in which it reads from the socket, and writes to the logfile.  It
exits this loop when the client closes its end of the socket or when a
client sends a SHUT message.<p>

If the client closes its end of the socket (for example, by exiting),
the server's call to <i>read()</i> will return a value of 0
(<i>numBytes</i> would be zero in the code above).  The server must
also close its end of the socket (using <i>close()</i>) before looping
back to accept another client connection.  If you fail to do this, the
fd will remain open, and the server will eventually crash with too many
open fds.<p>

<h2>The Client</h2>

The client for this assignment is quite simple.  It executes the
following algorithm:

<ol>
    <li>Process command line options.
    <li>Connect to the server.
    <li>Repeat:
    <ul>
        <li>Read a line of text from the user using <i>fgets()</i>.
        <li>Write the line to the server using <i>write()</i>.
    </ul>
</ol>

The client needs to recognize the following command line
options:<p>

<table width=50% cellpadding=5 align=center border=1>
  <tr>
    <td><b>-p</b> | <b>--port</b>
    <td>The server's port number to connect to.
  <tr>
    <td><b>-h</b> | <b>--host</b>
    <td>The server's host name.
  <tr>
    <td><b>-?</b> | <b>--help</b>
    <td>Print a usage message and exit.
  <tr>
    <td><b>-v</b> | <b>--version</b>
    <td>Print the client's version number and exit.
</table><p>

Here is semi-pseudocode for connecting to the server:
<pre>
      hp = gethostbyname( serverName )
      server_sockaddr.sin_family = AF_INET;
      memcpy( &amp;server_sockaddr.sin_addr, hp->h_addr, hp->h_length )
      server_sockaddr.sin_port = htons( serverPort )
      server_fd = socket( AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0 )
      connect( server_fd, (struct sockaddr *) &amp;server_sockaddr,
                                               sizeof server_sockaddr )
</pre>

As with the semi-pseudocode provided for the server, you have to supply
the variable declarations and add the code to check for errors.<p>

Once the call to <i>connect()</i> completes successfully, you can use
<i>server_fd</i> as the first argument in your call to <i>write()</i>.<p>

The client exits the loop at the end of its algorithm either when
reaching the end of file on <i>stdin</i> or when the server closes its
end of the socket.  End of file on <i>stdin</i> will happen if the user
types Control-D at the beginning of a line.  You can test for it using
<i>feof()</i>.  The client won't know that the server has closed its
end of the socket until it tries to write to it, which means that the
user has to type something in to get to the second part of the
read/write loop.  The only reason the server should close its end of
the socket before the client exits is if the user typed "SHUT," so you
can make your client a little smarter by having it exit automatically
if the user types "SHUT" (after first writing the message to the
server!).<p>

<h2>Final Testing and Submitting the Assignment</h2>

As always, be sure your code adheres to the <a
href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/coding_guidelines.html">
Coding Guidelines</a> for this course.<p>

You need to test your code carefully.  Be sure your Makefile is set up
correctly by using the <i>touch</i> command to modify the modification
times of the header, source, and object files and observing the commands
that <i>make</i> generates in each case.  <p>

Be sure "make depend" and "make clean" are working correctly. Be sure
that "make clean" followed by "make depend" works properly.<p>

Be sure you have entered meaningful log messages each time you checked
in your various files.  (If not, the messages can be changed, but it's
a lot of bother.  See the -m option of the <i>rcs</i> command.  Don't
worry about minor typos.)  Double-check that all RCS keywords have been
expanded properly in your .h and .cc files as well as your Makefile.<p>

You can check for yourself that there are no long lines or tab
characters in your code on both spinoza or lnx0006.  Give the
following command:
<pre>
      ~vickery/bin/chk_format Makefile *.h *.cc
</pre>
There will be no output if your files are okay.<p>

Be sure your code compiles and runs correctly on both spinoza and
lnx0006.  You should be able to run the server on either one and run
clients on the other.  Be sure you can run an endless sequence of
clients, with the server exiting only when one of them sends a SHUT
message or if one of the two signals is delivered to it.<p>

Check the contents of your logfile to be sure it is formatted properly
and contains the correct information.  Be sure the -o command line
option works properly for the server.<p>

When your assignment is ready, clean your project directory, create a
tar file of it, and email the tar file to me at my babbage account, <a
href="mailto:vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu">vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu</a>.<p>
 
<b>The due date is midnight, April 16</b>.  If you don't have the
project completed by then, send what you have done at that time so you
can get partial credit.  The assignment will count approximately 10% of
your course grade.<p>
