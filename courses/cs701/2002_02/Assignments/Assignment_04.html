<h1>Remote Shell - Version 2</h1>
<!--
<font color=red>
<h2>Incomplete: $Revision: 2.6 $</h2>

</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a continuation of the "remote shell" project started in
Assignment 3.  The goals for this version of the assignment are:

<ul>
    <li>Design and implement a protocol for the exchange of messages
    between clients and the server.
    <li>Modify the server so it can handle multiple clients concurrently
    instead of iteratively.
    <li>Implement command processing by the server.
</ul>

<h2>The Protocol</h2>

Clients and the server communicate by exchanging <i>messages</i>.  In
general, clients send <i>request messages</i> to the server, and the
server sends <i>reply messages</i> to the client.  Each message
consists of a fixed-length <i>message header</i> followed immediately
by a variable-length<i>message body</i>.  The length of a message body
is specified in the "msg_length" field of the message header, and may
be zero.<p>

A message header consists two 32-bit integer values, the msg_length
field mentioned above, followed by a msg_type field to be described
below.  Because the C/C++ languages do not specify the size of an
<i>int</i>, we will use a new type, called <i>int32_t</i> for these
integers to be sure they are 32 bits long on all platforms.  The
following code will provide a definition of this data type on all
platforms that I have tested: lnx0006 (Linux on IBM S/390), spinoza
(Linux on IA_32), forbin (OSF/1 on Alpha), and babbage (Solaris on
UltraSPARC):

<pre>
  #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
  #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;

  #ifndef int32_t
  typedef int int32_t;
  #endif
</pre>

That is, some of these systems predefine int32_t in stdlib.h, some in
sys/types.h.  On others, the type is not defined in any header file, but
the size of an <i>int</i> is 32 bits anyway.<p>

The msg_type field is to be an integer constant with the following
values and meanings defined.  The names listed should be declared as
int32_t constants, and you must be sure to convert these values (as well
as the msg_length values) to network byte order before sending them over
a socket connection.<p>

<tr>
    <th colspan=3><p>Client to Server Messages<p>

<tr>
    <th>Name
    <th>Value
    <th>Description

<tr>
    <td>CS_SHUT
    <td align=center>101

    <td>Message from <b>C</b>lient to <b>S</b>erver telling the server
    to <b>shut</b> down.  The message body has a length of zero.  The
    server responds by sending a SC_SHUT message (see below) to
    all clients (including the one that sent the CS_SHUT message to it,
    writing an appropriate message to the log file, closing it, and
    exiting.  <i>Note: This type code is unnecessary, and may be omitted
    if you wish.</i>

<tr>
    <td>CS_EXIT
    <td align=center>102

    <td>Message from Client to Server to indicate that the client is
    exiting.  The server responds by writing an appropriate message to
    the log file and releasing all resources associated with this
    client.  The message body has a length of zero.  This type code
    should be used when the client encounters end of file on
    <i>stdin</i> (because the user typed Control-D at the beginning of
    a line after being prompted to enter a command).

<tr>
    <td>CS_USER
    <td align=center>103

    <td>Message from Client to Server giving the login name of the local
    user.  This message is sent in response to a SC_LOGIN message
    from the server.  The message body contains the user's login
    name.  You can determine a user's login name by using the nested
    function calls <i>getpwuid( geteuid() )</i>.  But the user may
    override this name using the -u or --user command line option.

<tr>
    <td>CS_CMD
    <td align=center>104

    <td>The client sends a complete command line in the message body.

<tr>
    <td>CS_STDIN
    <td align=center>105

    <td>The client uses this message type to send anything the user
    types between the time a command has been sent to the server and the
    receipt of the next SC_PROMPT message from the server.

<h2>Starting the Assignment</h2>

All files for this assignment are to have RCS revision numbers in the
form 2.x.  Lock all your source files from Assignment 3 for editing, and
use the command, <i>ci -f -r2 *.h *.cc Makefile</i> to check them in
with revision numbers 2.1.  The log file message can simply be something
like, "First revision for Assignment 4," for all the files.<p>

All new files that you add to the project (such as <i>qprotocol.h</i>
described below) must also be checked in the first time with the "-r2"
option.  You will be prompted for both a file description and a log
message for each new file checked in this way, so be prepared to enter
proper information for both prompts.<p>

To start the assignment, modify qclient.cc so it handles the -u and
--user options.<p>

The next step is to define all the protocol constants listed above in a
header file that is to be included in both qclient.cc and qserver.cc. 
I suggest that you name this header file <i>qprotocol.h</i>.  Be sure
you document it and code it to handle nested includes of itself in the
usual way.  This header file is also the proper place to define
<i>int32_t</i>.<p>

At this point you should modify your client and server to make sure they
exchange protocol messages properly.  Still using an iterative server as
in Assignment 3, code your server and client so the client connects to
the server, and exchanges a proper set of messages with the server.  But
for this version of the project, there will be no SC_STDOUT, SC_STDERR,
or CS_STDIN messages.  The server will not actually exeute commands
entered by the user.  But you can test the other messages.  The body of
SC_PROMPT messages should be the value of the server's PS1 environment
variable if it is defined; if PS1 is not defined, use the prompt string,
"qserver> ".  For this version of the project, you do not need to handle
concurrent input from different sources.  The client and server should
simply alternate sending messages to each other.  The client, however,
will have to recognize two special commands that the user might type,
<i>exit</i> and <i>shut</i>, and send the proper types of messages to
the server in those cases.<p>

Test this version of the assignment carefully and check all files into
the RCS database before proceeding further in the project.<p>

<h3>Design Changes</h3>

In prototyping this project, I made two changes to the foregoing
description that you may want to incorporate in your project.  You are
not required to make these changes, but you may find them useful.<p>

The first change is to remove the recognition of the <i>shut</i> and
<i>exit</i> commands from the client; simply pass all command lines on
to the server, and let them be recognized and processed at that end. 
However, I programmed my client to send a CS_EXIT message to the server
when it encounters end of file while reading a command from the user. 
This change means that the client always actively informs the server
when it is exiting, which makes the server a bit easier to implement. 
This reasoning could be extended so that the client sets up an
<i>on_exit()</i> function that sends an SC_EXIT message to the server in
all situations, including receipt of a signal.<p>

The second change is to have the prompt string not be the value of the
PS1 environment variable.  Rather, have the server generate a prompt
string that includes the user's name, the server's host name, and the
current working directory (call <i>getcwd()</i> for the latter).  This
prompt string will be less distracting and more informative that the
usual value of PS1, which needs have various environment variables
recognized and substituted in order to be readable.  Note that the
current working directory will change when you implement the <i>cd</i>
builtin command (see below), so you will need to generate this string
each time you are going to send it.

<h3>Messaging Utility Functions</h3>

I found that writing the following functions helped in developing
the project.<p>

<table bgcolor=#ffccff align=center width=80% border=1 cellpadding=5>

<tr>
    <th>Function Prototype
    <th>Description

<tr>
    <td valign=top><i>int&nbsp;read_header(&nbsp;int,&nbsp;msg_header_t&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;);</i>
    <td>The first parameter is the fd of a socket from which to read a
    4-byte header.  The second parameter is a reference to a struct
    (defined in qprotocol.h) with two fields of type <i>int32_t</i>,
    which this function fills in with integer values in proper byte
    order.

<tr>
    <td valign=top><i>int&nbsp;read_body(&nbsp;int,&nbsp;msg_header_t,&nbsp;char&nbsp;*&nbsp;);</i>
    <td>Given a socket and a header, this function reads a message body.
    I decided to have the caller allocate the memory for the message
    body, but you could have this function do it instead.

<tr>
    <td valign=top><i>int&nbsp;recv_msg(&nbsp;int,&nbsp;msg_header_t&nbsp;&amp;char&nbsp;**&nbsp;);</i>
    <td>Given a socket, a reference to a header, and a pointer to a
    variable of type char&nbsp;*, this function reads a message header
    from the socket, fills in the header, allocates memory for the
    message body, and reads in the message body.  The caller is
    responsible for freeing the message body using delete[].

<tr>
    <td valign=top><i>int&nbsp;write_msg(&nbsp;int,&nbsp;const&nbsp;msg_header_t,&nbsp;const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*&nbsp;);</i>
    <td>Write a message header and message body to a socket.

<tr>
    <td valign=top><i>int&nbsp;send_msg(&nbsp;int,&nbsp;const&nbsp;int32_t,&nbsp;const&nbsp;char&nbsp;*&nbsp;);</i>
    <td>Given a socket, a message type, and a message body, construct a
    message header, and call <i>write_msg()</i> to transmit it.

<h2>Managing Concurrent Clients</h2>

As described in class, the server is to be a concurrent server, and the
design you are to use is to fork a separate "manager" process for each
concurrent client.  Managing these manager processes is the topic of
this section.<p>

Every time the server accepts a connection from a client, it forks a
child to manage the client.  If any manager's client enters a
"shutdown" command, that manager must notify the server process, which
in turn must notify all the manager processes so they can send SC_SHUT
messages to each of their clients and exit.  We will use signals to
handle the interprocess communication (IPC) both from the managers to
the server and from the server to the managers.<p>

<h3>Technical Note</h3>

<div class=NOTE>

  There is a technicality that needs to be cleared up before proceeding
  to how to work the signals.  You have already used <i>on_exit()</i>
  to set up an exit handler to make sure the server always shuts down
  cleanly, which continues to be a good idea for this assignment.<p>
   
  However, when the server forks a manager process, the manager gets a
  complete copy of the server's memory, its open fds, <i>etc.</i>  This
  "etc." includes both the server's signal handlers and exit
  handlers.<p>
   
  If the manager process called any of the <i>exec()</i> functions, the
  signal handlers and exit handlers would get reset to their default
  values (because the signal and exit handler functions would no longer
  be in the manager's memory).  But for this project, the manager
  processes do <i>not</i> call exec because of the programming overhead
  that would be needed to pass parameters from the server to a
  manager.  [Actually, you <i>can</i> write the code to be executed by
  a manager as a separately executable file if you like; it's not all
  that difficult.]  Here I'm assuming the manager simply calls the
  following function, instead of exec, to do its work:

  <pre>
    void manageClient( int fd, const char *client_host );
  </pre>

  This function should be defined in a separate .cc file to keep it
  logically separate from the code of the manager process.<p>

  The manager process can cancel the signal handling set up by the
  server process by using SIG_DFL for the second argument it passes
  to <i>signal()</i>:
  <pre>
    signal( SIGTERM,  SIG_DFL );
    signal( SIGINT,   SIG_DFL );
    signal( SIGCHLD,  SIG_DFL );
  </pre>
  Figure 10.1 of the textbook lists all signal names and their default
  actions.<p>

  However, there is no way (that I know of) to unset on-exit
  functions.  You can call <i>on_exit()</i> again to add another
  function to the list of functions to be called when the process
  exits, but you can't remove items from this list.<p>

  It's not elegant, but a solution to this problem is to have the
  manager processes always call <i>_exit()</i> when they exit and never
  call <i>exit()</i>.  See section 7.3 of the textbook for more details
  about the differences between <i>exit()</i> and <i>_exit()</i>.

</div>
<p>

Whenever a process terminates, the kernel sends SIGCHLD to its parent,
but the default action is to ignore this signal.  So the server must
call <i>signal()</i> in order to have its signal handler called when a
manager exits.  This signal handler uses <i>getpid()</i> to find out
which child is exiting, then uses <i>waitpid()</i> to get the child's
exit code and to let the child leave the zombie state.<p>

The manager process should call _exit(0) to exit normally, or _exit(1)
if it encounters an error.  But it uses a special exit code,
SHUTDOWN_EXIT (minus 2) when it exits because of a client's shutdown
command.  The manager's SIGCHLD handler checks for this exit code after
calling <i>waitpid()</i> and kills all the other manager processes when
this occurs.  I used a vector&lt;pit_t&gt; list in the server to keep
track of the active manager processes, and killed each manager
individually so I could be sure each one completed and was harvested by
<i>waitpid()</i>.  You could also create a process group for the manager
processes as described by a student in class, but you would't be able to
tell when all the managers have exited.<p>

<h3>Note:</h3>
<div class=NOTE>
The exit code returned by the WEXITSTATUS() macro will be an unsigned
integer between 0 and 255 (0x00 and 0xFF).  If you define SHUTDOWN_EXIT
to be -2 and the manager passes SHUTDOWN_EXIT to <i>_exit()</i> (see
below) it will appear to have a value of 254 (0x000000FE) instead of -2
(0xFFFFFFFE).  Don't let this bug you!
</div><p>

The manager processes should catch whatever signal you use to kill them
(SIGINT or SIGTERM), and write a SC_SHUT message to their clients before
exiting.<p>

You should verify that all of the process management issues described
here are working before proceeding to actual command line processing. 
You could use the following command interpreter while testing this part
of the assignment:

<pre>
    int processCommandLine( int fd, const char *command_line )
    {
      if ( 0 == strcmp( "exit", command_line ) )
        _exit( 0 );
      if ( 0 == strcmp( "shut", command_line ) )
        _exit( SHUTDOWN_EXIT );
      send_msg( fd, SC_STDOUT, "Unrecognized Command" );
      return 0;
    }
</pre>

<h2>Command Line Processing</h2>

There are three types of commands to process: builtin commands that must
execute from the same process as the client manager, builtin commands
that must execute as a separate process, and external commands, which
always must execute as a separate process.<p>

The builtin commands that must execute from the same process as the
client manager are <i>exit</i>, <i>shutdown</i>, and <i>cd</i>.  The
exit and shutdown commands must run from the manager process because
the manager process must be the one that exits!  It's exit code
(SHUTDOWN_EXIT or not) will tell the server process whether to shut
down or not.  The cd command must also execute from the manager's
process because it calls <i>chdir(2)</i> to do its work, and chdir
changes the current working directory of the process that called it; if
it were executed from a child process, it would have no effect once the
child process exits.<p>

There is one other builtin command you are to implement, and that one
should execute from a child process in order to enable I/O
redirection.  (I/O redirection is an optional part of this assignment.)
That command is <i>echo</i>.  For this assignment, have your echo
command exit with an exit code equal to the number of command line
arguments it received; you can use that value in your prompt string to
help verify that it is being handled correctly.<p>

External commands are to be executed using the <i>execvp(3)</i> library
call.  This function is easier to use than the <i>execve(2)</i> kernel
call because execve requires you to specify the full pathname to the
command file, whereas execvp will search your process' PATH to find the
executable file.  So, by using execvp you avoid having to tokenize PATH
and search each directory in the list for an executable file.  The
tradeoff is that execvp takes only two arguments, so you cannot change
a command's environment.  (You can add code to do that in the "next
assignment" for this course!)<p>

<h3>Tokenizing a Command Line</h3>

You can use <i>strtok()</i> to separate a command line into
whitespace-separated tokens, as you did in the <i>wc</i> assignment at
the beginning of the semester.  Here is a sketch of some code that
builds an argument vector out of a command line, treating I/O
redirection tokens (&lt; and &gt;) specially:

<pre>
  static vector<const char *> token_vec;
  const char *token = strtok( buf, " \t\n\r" );
  while ( token != 0 )
  {
    token_vec.insert( token_vec.end(), token );
    token = strtok( 0, " \t\n\r" );
  } 
  int num_tokens = token_vec.size();

  for ( vi = token_vec.begin(); vi < token_vec.end(); vi++ )
  {
    if ( 0 == strcmp( *vi, "&lt;" ) )
    {
      redirect_stdin = *(++vi);  // Need to check for null pointer.
    }
    else
      arg_vector[ ++arg_count ] == *vi;
  }
  //  Add null pointer to end of argument vector (required when calling
  //  execvp).
  arg_vector[ arg_count ] = 0;

</pre>

 
<h3>Dispatch Tables</h3>

By making the prototypes for builtin commands as similar to
<i>main()</i> as possible, we can accomplish two things: (1) We can use
the same data structures and procedures for parsing the command line no
matter which of the three types of commands we are working with, and (2)
we can use a single function prototype for all builtin commands,
allowing us to use a <i>dispatch table</i> to call the functions that
implement the builtin commands.  Dispatch tables use the function
pointers, which do not exist in Java.<p>

Here is the prototype we want to use for one of our builtin commands, in
this case, the function that implements the echo command:

<pre>
  int do_echo( int argc, char *argv[] );
</pre>
 
The dispatch table is to consist of an array of structs, each of which
contains the name of a builtin command as a string, and a <i>pointer</i>
to the function that will handle that command name.  The struct we want
needs to include a field for a "pointer to a function that receives an int
and a char*[] and returns an int."  Here is a typedef for such a beast:

<pre>
  typedef int builtin_func_t( int argc, char *argv[] );
</pre>

(If you want your builtin commands to be able to send messages directly
to clients, you could add another int paramter for the fd of the socket
connecting to the client.)<p>

Now you can write prototypes for all your builtin functions like this:

<pre>
  builtin_func_t do_exit, do_shut, do_chdir, do_echo;
</pre>

You can define the struct of command names and function pointers like
this:

<pre>
  struct dispatch_t
  {
    const char            *func_name;
    const builtin_func_t  *func_ptr;
  };
</pre>

And you can build your array of command names and pointers to functions
like this:

<pre>
  dispatch_t  no_fork[] =
  {
    { "exit",     do_exit   },
    { "q",        do_exit   },
    { "shut",     do_shut   },
    { "shutdown", do_shut   },
    { "cd",       do_chdir  },
  };
const int num_no_fork = sizeof( no_fork ) / sizeof( dispatch_t );
</pre>

As the name of the array implies, there should be separate dispatch
table arrays for those builtins that require a fork() and those that
don't.  Note also that you can easily set up multiple command names
pointing to the same function, which act essentially like builtin
command aliases.  Finally, note that the constant num_no_fork gives the
number of entries in the array, even if the number of entries grows or
shrinks in future versions of the project.<p>

Finally, here is code that checks if a command name (arg_vector[0]) is
one of the do_fork[] commands, and calls the corresponding function if
it is:

<pre>
  for ( int i = 0; i < num_no_fork; i++ )
  {
    if ( 0 == strcmp( arg_vector[ 0 ], no_fork[ i ].func_name ) )
    {
      command_status =
            no_fork[ i ].func_ptr( client_fd, arg_count, arg_vector );
      return;
    }
  }
</pre>

If execution falls through the for loop instead of returning, it means
that the command name wasn't found in the no-fork dispatch table, and
the program has to fork a child process, which will then look for the 
command name in the do-fork dispatch table, or try to use execvp to
execute the command if it is not there.

<h3>Global Variables</h3>

Global variables can make program management very error-prone.  It's
difficult to keep track of what functions modify the global variables,
what ones access their values, and what functions don't use them at all.
But global variables can be useful because they avoid a lot of parameter
passing, which can be difficult to keep track of.  For example, client
managers must keep track of exit code of each command that it executes
because that is the value of the "$?" shell variable (to be implemented
in Assignment 8 of this project).  So it makes sense to use a global
variable, named command_status in the previous code, to keep track of
each command's exit code.  It might be set by a no-fork builtin, by a
do-fork builtin, or by an external command (the code you get by calling
<i>wait()</i> or <i>waitpid()</i>).  And in this assignment, you can use
its value as part of the prompt string sent to the client for each
command.<p>

You should minimize the scope of global variables by declaring them static
wherever possible.  A static variable (or constant) declared outside of
any function definition is visible only to the functions defined in the
.cc file where it appears.<p>

The bottom line here is that global variables are sometimes necessary,
but should be used carefully.

<h3>Overview of Command Processing</h3>

Before looking at how to manage I/O for commands being executed, here is
a birds-eye view of what we want to accomplish:

<ul>

  <li>The client toggles between two different states once it has
  completed the initial user-authentication exchage with the server:
  (1) When it gets a SC_PROMPT message from the server, it displays the
  prompt, and blocks until the user enters a command line.  When it has
  the command line, it sends it to the server in a CS_CMD message, and
  enters the other state.  (2) From the time it sends a CS_CMD message
  until it receives another SC_PROMPT message, the client sends any
  input it receives from <i>stdin</i> to the server in CS_STDIN
  messages.

  <li>The server forks a process to manage each client connection.  The
  manager process authenticates the user and sends a SC_PROMPT message
  to the client.  When it gets a CS_CMD message, the manager parses the
  command line, and tries to execute the command as a no-fork builtin, a
  do-fork builtin, or a as an external command.  No-fork builtins can
  send SC_STDOUT and/or SC_STDERR messages to the client.  But commands
  that require forking have to be handled as follows:
  
  <ul>

    <li>The manager process is the parent of the command process. 
    Before forking, it creates three pipes (using <i>pipe(2)</i>, one
    for the child's stdin, one for the child's stdout and one for its
    stderr.  After forking, the manager closes the reading side of the
    stdin pipe, and the writing side of both these pipes, and then goes
    into a polling loop in which it waits for input from the client
    (CS_STDIN messages; it writes the message body to the client's
    stdin pipe), from the stdout pipe (it sends SC_STDOUT messages to
    the client), or from the stderr pipe(it sends SC_STDERR messages to
    the client).  The manager continues to poll for input until both the
    stdin and stderr pipes are closed.  It uses SIGCHLD to harvest the
    exit codes of the child processes used to execute do-fork or
    external commands.

    <li>The child of the manager closes the writing side of the stdin
    pipe and the writing sides of the stdout and stderr pipes.  It uses
    <i>dup2()</i> to transfer the reading side of the stdin pipe to fd
    number 0, and two more calls to <i>dup2()</i> to set up stdout and
    stderr.  Then it checks if the command name is in the do-fork
    dispatch table, and executes it if it is.  If not, it calls execvp
    to try to execute an external command.  If the call to execvp fails
    it means the user has entered an invalid command name, and the child
    process should write a message saying "Unknown command." to stderr
    (which the manager process will pass on to the client in a SC_STDERR
    message).  The child process must always exit.

<h2>Submitting the Assignment</h2>

The assignment is due by midnight on the last day of exams (Friday, May
24.)  Create a tar file of your clean project directory, and add to it a
text file named README (spelled and capitalized just like that) that
tells how much of the project you finished so I can tell what parts to
test and what not to test.  This is not a documentation file, just a
note that tells what parts of the project do and don't work.<p>

There will be no extensions for the project and no INC grades for the
course.<p>

The final exam will be based in large part on the concepts involved in
doing the project (managing sockets, processes, signals, pipes,
etc.).   Rather than have the project due before the final, I am
providing you with my solution for you to study from.  If you decide to
copy any of my code in the final version of your project, you may do
so, but indicate what code you copied in your README file.  If you use
my code as a model and write your own code based on that model, you
don't have to mention that in your README file.  <i>Warning:</i>  My
code works (Mostly!  See "Known Bugs" below.), but my model for doing
the project is probably different from what you have already started. 
Trying to change your code to use parts of mine will probably cause
more problems than if you just write your own code.  And you're not
allowed just to submit all my own code back to me!<p>

<h3>Known Bugs in Dr. Vickery's Code</h3>

<ul>

  <li>Unable to write more than one line of input to a command's stdin
  except by redirection.</i>

  <li>There are four source modules with over 300 lines of code each;
  they should be broken into smaller modules.

</ul>
