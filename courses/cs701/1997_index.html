This is the place to go for material you will need if you are
registered for CS-701 at Queens College during the Spring 1997
semester.<P>

Before reading this, you should read the description of the course at
the <A HREF="description.html">Description of CS-701</A> page.  Don't

Welcome to CS-701, Software Design.  The course meets Tuesday and
Thursday evenings in the Science Building room B-145 from 6:30 to
7:45.  I will hold office hours after Thursday's classes, but you will
probably find it most convenient to interact with me outside of class
by email (<i>vickery at babbage.cs.qc.edu</i>).  I encourage you to
contact me any time you have a problem with the course.  If there is
anything about any assignment or any class material that you are
unclear about, contact me.  It's much better to get the correct
information from me than the wrong information from someone else!<P>

If there is a problem in the lab and I do not respond to email quickly
enough, there are a couple of other options.  One is to send email to
the department's system administrators, Prashant Joshi
(<i>joshi at wizard.cs.qc.edu</i>) and Peter Chen
(<i>peter at wizard.cs.qc.edu</i>).  Don't forget to check our offices,
too.  Mine is in room A-222, and Peter and Prashant are both in A-215.
Also, you can call my office phone, 997-3508, where you can leave a
message.<P>

There is a lot of programming to do in this course, and I expect you
to do your own work, to read all relevant documentation, and, where
necessary, to experiment with the system to figure out how to get your
code to work.  Sometimes, though, you will get stuck.  If you have made
an effort to solve a problem but you really are stuck, don't waste a
lot of time on it.  Tell me about it so I can help you.  Some students
feel embarrassed to ask a professor for help and prefer to try to get
help from friends.  Don't do that.  It is part of my job to help you,
and I am more likely to help you solve your problem correctly than
anyone else.  After all, I am the one who assigned your the problem
that got you stuck in the first place!

<h2><A NAME="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</A></h2>

There is a <a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>
for this course that you should be familiar with.  It deals with problems,
emergencies, and general operating procedures for using the workstations
in the laboratory.<p>

<h2><A NAME="writing">Writing Style</A></h2>

Software developers need to be able to write well in order to
communicate with users, software administrators, and maintenance
programmers.  You should consult a <A HREF="strunk.html">style
manual</A> to help develop a good writing style for the written material
you prepare for this course.<p>

<h2><A NAME="coding">Coding Guidelines</A></h2>

<i>Every</i> program file that you submit for this course has to follow
a specified format, both <code>.h</code> and <code>.cc</code> files.
Read the <A HREF="coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</A> for
this course <i>before</i> you start writing your code.  You may need to
modify these guidelines somewhat if you write object-oriented code in
C++.  (Everyone will use the GNU C++ compiler, but it is possible to
write "C style" code instead of object-oriented code even though it is
a C++ compiler.)<P>

<h2><A NAME="grading">Grading Forms</A></h2>

For each programming assignment, there will be a grading form that
tells what criteria will be used in assigning grades and how many
points each part of the assignment is worth.  After I grade your
project I will email you an edited copy of the grading form with my
comments in it as well as your grade.  Look at the <A
HREF="gf.html">Standard Grading Form</A> now to get an idea what the
typical requirements for projects are.<P>

<h2><A NAME="handouts">Handouts</A></h2>

Here are links to some files that may be referenced during the
course.

<ul>

<li><A HREF="Handouts/man_pages.html">Writing <i>man</i>
pages.</A> There is a text formatting langugage used for writing user
documentation to be viewed using the Unix <i>man</i> command.  This
handout should tell you enough to produce decent-looking <i>man</i>
pages for this course.

<li><A HREF="Handouts/rcs_keywords.txt">RCS Keywords.</A> This is just a
text file with a list of RCS keywords for quick reference.

<li><A HREF="Handouts/using_gdb.html">Using GDB.</A> Some information to
help get you started using the <I>gdb</I> debugger.  If you are in the
lab, you should use the <I>ddd</I> graphical interface to <I>gdb</I>; it
provides excellent on-line help.

<li><A HREF="Handouts/using_rcs.html">Using RCS.</A> Some information
on using the RCS Revision Control System, one of the major project
management tools you need to use in this course.

<li><A HREF="Handouts/using_make.html">Using <I>make</I>.</A> The other
major project management tool used in this course.

<li><A HREF="Handouts/using_visu.html">Using SPARCworks Visual.</A>
SPARCworks Visual gives you a graphical user interface for building
graphical user interfaces for your Unix programs.  Most students who see
it say something to the effect of, "Oh, it's like Visual Basic!"  This
handout tells you how to run the excellent interactive tutorial that's
available for SPARCworks Visual.  When you get done, you'll have your
own ice cream parlor.

<li><A HREF="Handouts/using_sockets.html">BSD Sockets Primer.</A> The
sample code in this tutorial does not exactly conform to ANSI C/C++
standards, but the concepts behind using BSD sockets are explained
quite well.  This tutorial was written by someone named Jim Frost in
1990, distributed on a "Developer's CD" by Sun in 1997, and I converted
it to HTML.

</ul>

<h2><A NAME="assignments">This and Previous Semesters' Assignments</A></h2>

You can look at the assignments, grading forms, and exams for this and
previous semesters by selecting from this list:

<ul>
<li> <A HREF="Fall97">Fall 1997</A>
<li> <A HREF="Spring97">Spring 1997</A>
<li> <A HREF="Fall96">Fall 1996</A>.
<li> <A HREF="Spring96">Spring 1996</A>.
<li> <A HREF="Fall95">Fall 1995</A>.
<li> <A HREF="Spring95">Spring 1995</A>
</ul>

<h2><A NAME="publish">Publish Your Own Web Pages</A></h2>

Because some assignments in this coures typically involve the WWW in one
way or another, students have expressed an interest in "publishing"
their own Web pages.  It's not part of CS-701 to do so, but you can
experiment with it if you are interested: Put up web pages under your
<I>qcunix1</I> account.  Create a directory named
<CODE>public_html</CODE> in your home directory, use <I>chmod 755</I> to
make both this directory and your home directory publicly readable, and
put your web pages in your <CODE>public_html</CODE> directory.  The URLs
for your pages will be something like <I>http://www.qc.edu/~&lt;your
qcunix account name&gt;/mypage.html</I>.<P>

<A
HREF="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">An
introductory tutorial on HTML</A>, the Hypertext Markup Language, is
available from NCSA to get you started.  An HTML Reference Manual is
available for <A HREF=

(Version 2.0) from Sandia Natioal Laboratories.  Information about the
<A HREF= "http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur">HTML 3.2 Standard</A>
