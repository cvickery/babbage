<H1 ALIGN=center>CS-701 Software Design</H1>
<H1 ALIGN=center>Course Description</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

CS-701 introduces you to the standard tools
for developing and managing large software projects. There is
some chicanery involved in this effort, since we do not have time
in one semester both to introduce the tools and actually to implement
large projects. The compromise is to learn enough about the tools to use
them in a few "medium-sized" projects.<p>

Each student works individually in the course.  There is some
practice in writing code that must interface with existing code written
by others, but you do not work as part of a group for any of the
assignments.<p>

You will work with well-known industry standards: Unix System V (Solaris
version 2.5) running on Sun SPARC workstations, the C programming
language (or C++ if you prefer), the Motif window manager and toolkit
for the X Window System, and TCP/IP-based client-server computing.  All
development tools are from the Free Software Foundataion (Project GNU): The
<i>gcc</i> or <i>g++</i> compiler, the gdb debugger, the GNU
<i>make</i> utility, and the RCS project management tool.  You will
also have the use of the <i>ddd</i> X Window interface to <i>gdb,</i>
which comes from the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Germany.<p>

<H2>Your Background</H2>

The prerequisite for the course is satisfactory completion of CS-700.  Your background
must include a course in principles of operating systems and a working
knowledge of the C language.  You must also know how to use Unix
commands to log in and perform basic file manipulations (create and list
directories; edit, move, and copy files).<P>

The course assumes that you already know how to program in C.
To give you an idea of the degree of programming competence I
expect, here is a list of some of the things you should be able
to do in C before you start the course:<p>

<UL>
<LI>Process command line arguments.
<LI>Perform basic file operations (open, read, write, close).
<LI>Create a data structure that contains various data types,
including pointers to functions and pointers to structures.
<LI>Build and traverse a linked list using <I>malloc()</I> to
allocate the nodes dynamically.
<LI>Be familiar with string processing functions from the standard
library (<I>strcmp(), strcat(), strtok(), strtol(), etc.</I>).
<LI>Be familiar with the use of header files.
<LI>Be able to put functions in different source code files, link
them together, and share information between the functions.
</UL>

Remember that each graduate student in the Computer Science Department
has an account on the Academic Computer Center's timesharing system
running Unix, <I>qcunix,</I> which you can use to bring your C
programming up to speed before the course begins.<p>

<H2>Course Description</H2>

This course uses a sequence of programming exercises to illustrate
the use of library and system calls, process management, interprocess
communication, and graphical user interface programming. Exercises
in recent semesters have included a program to study algorithm
timings, an interactive shell program, a World Wide Web server,
a World Wide Web browser, and a text annotation system.<P>

Writing documentation is an important part of this course. You
will write separate documentation for each of the three nominal
parties of a software project:<p>

<ul>
<li>Systems Administrators, the people who install the software that you
develop.
<li>Users, the people who use the software that you develop.
<li>Programmers, the people who maintain the software that you develop.
</ul>

All documentation will be
graded on the basis of proper English usage as well as on content
and structure.  You should consult a standard style manual, such as <A HREF="http://www.cc.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/">Strunk's
<EM>Elements of Style</EM></A>, which is available on-line.<p>

<A NAME="textbooks"><H3>Textbooks</H3></A>

Curry, D. A. <I>Unix Systems Programming</i>,
<A HREF="http://www.ora.com">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</A>, 1996. <B>Required.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>You will be responsible for the material in all Chapters
except 12, 15, and 16.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Sobell, M. G. <I>Unix System V: A Practical Guide, Third
Edition,</I> <A HREF="http://www.aw.com">Benjamin Cummings</A>, 1995.
<B>Highly Recommended.</B> <BLOCKQUOTE>You will need this book or its
equivalent to know how to use the Unix operating system in the
laboratory, especially if you are not too familiar with Unix yet. 
There are chapters on the editor, the shell, using the file system, and
various utility programs you will be using.  Be sure your book is for
Unix "SVR4" (System V Release 4) rather than some other Unix variant,
such as SunOS, BSD, Coherent, or Linux.</BLOCKQUOTE>

UNIX <I>man</I> pages.<B> Required.</B> Access these on-line.<P>

<A NAME="harbison">Harbison, S. P. and Steele, G. L. Jr. <I>C: A
Reference Manual, Fourth Edition,</I></A> <A
HREF="http://www.prenhall.com">Prentice-Hall</A>, 1995.<B>Recommended.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Everybody needs a C reference manual, and this is the one I
use.  Alternatively, you might prefer to use a C++ reference manual,
such as one of the volumes by Stroustrup:
<ul>
  <li>Stroustrup, B.  <i>The C++ Programming Language, Second Edition</i>
  <li> Ellis, M. and Stroustrup, B.  <i>The Annotated C++ Reference Manual</i>
</ul>
Both of these are published by <A
HREF="http://www.aw.com">Addison-Wesley</A>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Nye, A. and O'Reilly, T. <I>X Toolkit Intrinsics Programming
Manual:  OSF/Motif 1.2 Edition,</I> Volume 4 in &quot;The Definitive
Guides to the X Window System,&quot; <A
HREF="http://www.ora.com">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</A>, 1993.  This
volume may also be called "Volume 4M" rather than "Volume Four: Motif
Edition."  In any case, the ISBN is 1-56592-013-9.
<B>Highly Recommended.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>In past semesters we have not had enough time to do proper
justice to Motif programming, and students have been able to complete
their assignments without buying this book.  In those semesters I gave
out sample code for a Motif application, and students learned just
enough about Motif to be able to modify it.  I plan to follow the same
strategy this semester.  However, you will learn more from the sample
code if you have this book available than if you just rely on what I
say about it in class.  Also, this book or its equiavalent will be
essential to you if you ever do any Motif programming beyond this
course.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Heller, D. and Ferguson, P. M. <I>Motif Programming Manual for
OSF/Motif Release 1.2,</I> Volume 6A in &quot;The Definitive Guides to
the X Window System,&quot; <A HREF="http://www.ora.com">O'Reilly &amp;
Associates</A>, 1994.<B> Recommended.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The same material is available on-line, so this one is not
so important to buy.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> Oram, A. and Talbott, S. <I>make,</I> <A
HREF="http://www.ora.com">O'Reilly &amp; Associates</A>, 1991.<B>
Recommended.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>More than you will need to know about <i>make</i> for this
course, but an excellent source if you really want to master this
utility.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> van der Linden, P. <I>Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets,</I> <A
HREF="http://www.prenhall.com">Prentice-Hall</A>, 1994.
<B>Recommended.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Read this if you want to learn the tricks of the trade used
by professional C programmers.  Some of the material is oriented
towards Sun systems, but the vast majority applies to all systems.  You
could call this book, "Things you should have learned in school but
probably didn't."  It's very entertaining as well as
informative.</BLOCKQUOTE>
