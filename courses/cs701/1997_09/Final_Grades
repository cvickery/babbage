Here is how I computed everyone's average for the course:

There were four exercises (Ex1-Ex4), two assignments (As1 and As2), a
midterm exam (Mid), and a final exam (Final).

Each exercise was graded on a 3-point scale, with an "ok" worth a full
3 points, "not ok" worth 1 point, and a "good" worth 4 points (extra
credit).  A sum of 12 was considered a perfect score for the exercises.

Here are the weights used to compute the average:

    10%   Exercises
    20%   Ex1 (Hex Dump)
    25%   Ex2 (Object Broker)
    20%   Midterm Exam
    25%   Final Exam

Exam and Project Statistics:

                Mid   Finl  As1   As2
          Mean: 76.2  74.7  8.6   8.3
        Median: 76.0  74.0  9.0   8.2

If a person's midterm and final exam scores differed by 15 points or
more, the weight for the lower score was reduced by 3% and the weight
for the higher score was increased by 3%.

The translation from a course average to a letter grade is dictated by
college policy.  After rounding to the nearest integer, the translation
is:

       97 - 100 A+
       93 - 96  A
       90 - 92  A-
       87 - 89  B+
       83 - 86  B
       80 - 82  B-
       70 - 79  C
       00 - 69  F

Although it is possible to receive a grade of A+ in the course, it
counts the same as an A in your GPA.

Here is the distribution of final grades in the course:

      A   B   C   F   INC
      4   2   6   1    6
