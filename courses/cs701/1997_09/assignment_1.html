The project directory is to contain an RCS subdirectory, and nothing
else.  The RCS database for the project is to include entries for the
files <code>main.cc</code>, <code>hexline.cc</code>,
<code>Makefile</code>, <code>hexdump.1</code>, and
<code>hexline.3</code>. These files are described below.  Consult "<a
href="../using_rcs.html">Using RCS</a>" for information on how to set
up your project directory and use RCS for project management.<p>

Your <code>~/man</code> directory tree is to contain <i>man</i> pages
for <i>hexdump(1)</i> and <i>hexline(3)</i>.  See "<a
href="../man_pages.html">How to Write a Man Page</a>" for information
on how to prepare your <code>man</code> pages.<p>

You may also leave a <code>README</code> file in the project directory
if you think that one is needed, but I neither expect nor require you
to do so.<p>

When the assignment is complete, send me an email message telling me
the path to the project directory.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

You are to write a utility program that can be used to print the
contents of files in hexadecimal.  The name of the command is
<code>hexdump</code>, and it must be built from three source files,
which are named <code>main.cc</code>, <code>hexline.cc</code>, and
<code>hexline.h</code>.  The header file must be <code>#included</code>
in both the <code>.cc</code> files.<p>

I will provide a <code>Makefile</code>, the <code>hexline.h</code> header
file, and a library file named <code>libhex.so</code>.  The
<code>Makefile</code> has been emailed to you, the header file is
installed in your <code>~/include</code> directory, and the library
file is installed in your <code>~/lib</code> directory.  Create a
directory just for this project, and copy the <code>Makefile</code>
into it before you start work on the project.  Always use the
<i>make(1)</i> command to compile and link your program.  (There is an
alias for "make" to save you all that typing: "mk".)<p>

You are to do the project in two steps.  For the first step you are to
write <code>main.cc</code> and build <code>hexdump</code> by linking
<code>main.o</code> with <code>libhex.so</code>, which contains a
single object module with the function definition for
<i>hexline()</i>.  Once you have the code for this step tested and
debugged, you are to write your own version of <code>hexline.cc</code>,
create a new <code>libhex.so</code>, and link your main program to it. 
The <code>Makefile</code> supplied to you has two lines that will build
the new <code>libhex.so</code> for you, but you have to remove the
comment markers ('<code>#</code>' characters) from them.  Read the
<code>Makefile</code> to find them.<p>

Write <code>man</code> pages for hexline(3) and hexdump(1).  Check all
<code>.cc</code>, <code>.h</code>, <code>.1</code>, <code>.3</code>,
and <code>Manpage</code> files into RCS using the <code>ci</code>
command.  Delete all other files from your project directory, and make
sure the command "mk" builds the program using both your
<code>.cc</code> files.  Check out copies of the <code>man</code> pages
and copy them to the proper directories, clean up the project
directory, and send me mail with the pathname of the project
directory.<p>

<H2><code>hexdump</code></H2>

As described in class, <code>hexdump</code> takes two optional command line
options:

<blockquote>
  <DL>
    <DT><B>-s &lt;n&gt;</B><DD>Specifies a starting offset for the dump. 
    The default value is zero, which means to begin the dump with the
    first byte of the file.
    <DT><B>-e &lt;n&gt;</B><DD>Specifies the offset of the last byte of
    the file to be dumped.  The default value is -1, which means "the last
    byte of the file."
  </DL>
</blockquote>

After the options, the user may enter any number of file names.  Each
file will be dumped from its starting offset to its ending offset.  If
no file names are given, the program dumps stdin.<p>

For this assignment, you must do all input and output by using the
<i>read()</i> and <i>write()</i> system calls.  Exception: you may use
<i>perror()</i> and/or <i>fprintf()</i> for writing error messages to
stderr.

<H2><i>hexline()</i></H2>

The <i>hexline()</i> function generates the character representation of
one line of a file dump.  The first argument is a pointer to an 81-byte
"output" buffer where the formatted line is returned; the second
argument is a pointer to a 16-byte "input" buffer containing the data
to be formatted; the third argument is an integer that will be
formatted to print in the first 8 bytes of the output buffer; the
fourth and fifth arguments are starting and ending offsets for limiting
how much of the input buffer is to be formatted.  If either buffer
argument is NULL, or if the starting and ending offsets are not between
0 and 15, or the ending offset is less than the starting offset,
<i>hexline()</i> returns a value of -1 without changing the contents of
the output buffer.  Otherwise, it formats the output buffer and returns
a value of zero.<p>

There is a working version of <code>hexdump</code> in
<code>~vickery/bin</code>, which you may use to see what the program is
supposed to do.<p>
