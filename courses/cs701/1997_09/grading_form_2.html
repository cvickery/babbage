<H1 align=center>Grading Form for Object Broker Project</H1>

<H2>Project Management (3 points)</H2>
<ul>

  <li>Is the project directory empty except for the RCS subdirectory?

  <li>Does a <I>make</I> command build the latest version of the
  project?

  <li>Does "make COFLAGS=&lt;n&gt;" build use case &lt;n&gt; from a
  clean project directory?

  <li>Are RCS $Id$ and $Log$ keywords present in all source files, man
  pages, and the Makefile?

  <li>Was each revision checked in with a meaningful log message?

  <li>Is there a version string in each <CODE>.cc</CODE> file?

  <li>How well are header files integrated into the Makefile?  Is there
  a "depend" rule that handles this?

  <li>How well is installation of <I>man</I> pages integrated into the
  Makefile?  Is there an "install" rule that handles this?

</ul>  

<H2>User Documentation (2 points)</H2>
<ul>

  <li>Are there <I>man</I> pages for each use case for each program?

  <li>Are <I>man</I> pages named properly and installed in the proper
  directory?

  <li>Are they structured in standard <I>man</I> page format, with only
  the appropriate sections included?  (Note: There should not be an
  "Availability" section, and "Examples" are normally not needed because
  the "Synopsis" should tell the user what to type.)

  <li>Is the writing clear, succinct, accurate, and appropriate for the
  audience who would read them?

</ul>

<H2>Coding Style (2.5 points)</H2>
<ul>

  <li>Does code and documentation conform to the <a
  href="../coding_guidelines.html">Coding Guidelines</a> for this
  course?

  <li>Does the structure of the code make sense?  For example, is the
  processing of the requests actually being done in the processing
  functions?

</ul>

<H2>Functionality (2.5 points)</H2>

<ul>

  <li><B>Use Case 1: <I>om</I> and <I>ou</I> Exchange Datagrams (1
  point).</B>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the <I>ou</I> "listClasses" command line option work?
    <li>Does the <I>ou</I> "exit" command line option work?
  </ul>

  <li><B>Use Case 2: <I>om</I> Writes a Log File (0.5 point).</B>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the log file have the proper name and is it located in the
    current directory, regardless of where the program itself is
    located?
    <li>Does each line of the log file start with a properly formatted
    timestamp, and is the associated message on the same line as the
    timestamp?
    <li>Are all significant events written to the log file?
    <li>Is the log file easy to read?
  </ul>

  <li><B>Use Case 2a: Change Structure of <I>om</I> code (0.5
  point).</B>
  <ul>
    <li>Are header files and function prototypes set up properly for
    the log file and dispatch table modules?
    <li>Are the header files used properly in the source modules that
    define and reference the functions whose prototypes are in the
    header files?
    <li>Does <I>om</I> link and run properly using the new structure?
  </ul>

  <li><B>Use Case 3: The Object Broker First Appears (0.5).</B>
  <ul>
    <li>Is a proper log file generated, using the shared module
    developed for Use Case 2a?
    <li>Is the dispatch table set up properly, using the shared module
    developed for Use Case 2a?
    <li>Does <I>ou</I> send the four request types to <I>ob</I>
    properly?
    <li>Does <I>ob</I> respond properly to each of the four request
    types?
    <li>Does <I>ob</I> respond reasonably to invalid request types?
  </ul>

  <li><B>Use Case 4: <I>ob</I> and <I>om</I> Communicate (Multiply
  project
  grade by 1.05).</B>
  <ul>
    <li>Does <I>ob</I> generate unique names properly in response to
    "hello" requests, and are they written to the log file properly?
    <li>Does <I>ob</I> respond to "list managers" requests with a proper
    list of managers?
    <li>Does <I>ob</I> respond reasonably to "list" requests that are
    not for "managers"?
    <li>Does the list of managers accurately reflect intermixed "hello"
    and "good-bye" requests?
    <li>Does a "shutdown" request cause "exit" requests to be sent to
    managers by <I>ob</I> before it exits itself?
  </ul>

  <li><B>Use Case 5: <I>ou</I> and <I>om</I> Communicate Through
  <I>ob</I>
  (Multiply project grade by 1.10).</B>
  <ul>
    <li>Does "list classes &lt;manager&gt;" produce the proper list of
    classes, provided &lt;manager&gt; is valid?
    <li>Does "list classes &lt;manager&gt;" generate reasonable behavior
    if &lt;manager&gt; is not valid?
  </ul>

</ul>
