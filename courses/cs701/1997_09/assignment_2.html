Assignment 2, CS-701, Fall 1997
<H1 align=center>Object Broker Project</H1>

<B>Due Date:</B> This assignment is due by midnight December 23, 1997. 
There will be no "late points" or extensions for this project.  If you
don't finish the entire project, hand in whatever you have finished by
the deadline.<p>

<B>Deliverables:</B> Create a project directory for this project, and
email me its path when you are ready to submit the assignment.  The
project directory is to contain nothing except a subdirectory named RCS
and, possibly, a file named README.  A README file is neither required
nor expected for this assignment, but I will read it if you leave one in
the project directory.  Use a README file rather than email to tell me
any way(s) in which your project deviates from the assignment that I
should know about.<p>

One requirement for this assignment is to develop a sequence of <I>use
cases</I> from a common code base.  Each use case will have its own
revsion number as listed in the description of the project below.  The
first use case will be known as "Step 1," the next one will be "Step
2," etc.  From an empty project directory (except for the RCS
subdirectory), a use case is created by issuing the following
command:

<pre>
      mk COFLAGS=-r&lt;n&gt;
</pre>

In this command, &lt;n&gt; is the revision number for the use case to
be built.  Consult <A href="../Handouts/using_rcs.html">the handout
page on Using RCS</A> for more information on how this will work with
your Makefile for the project.<p>

<B>Requirements:</B> In addition to the information given here, be sure
to consult the <A HREF="grading_form_2.html">Grading Form for this
assignment</A>, which includes additional information about the
requirements for this project.<p>

<H2>Project Description</H2>

For this assignment, an <I>object manager</I> is defined as a program
that manages classes and class instances (objects).  An object manager
knows how to create and delete class instances, how to provide lists of
the classes and class instances being managed, and how to invoke class
and instance methods for the classes and objects under its
management.<p>

An <I>object broker</I> is defined as a program that knows how to
locate the object manager for a class or class instance and which acts
as an intermediary between the class manager and programs that need to
invoke the class and instance methods managed by an object manager.<p>

For this assignment you will be developing three separate programs that
communicate with each other using our own CSSOOOBP ("Computer Science
Seven-Oh-One Object Broker Protocol").  (CSSOOOBP is pronounced "cuss
soup.")  The programs will communicate with each other using
lower-level network socket protocols.<p>

We will start by developing the object manager program called <I>om</I>
and a client program called <I>ou</I> (object user) that accesses the
<I>om</I>.  We will gradually add functionality to both of these
programs until they provide enough functionality to warrent development
of the third program, <I>ob</I> (object broker).<p>
