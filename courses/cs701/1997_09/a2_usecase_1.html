<H1 align=center>Object Broker Project -- Use Case 1</H1>


<H3>Use Case 1 -- <I>om</I> and <I>ou</I> Exchange Datagrams</H3>

Create a new directory for this project, and create an RCS subdirectory
under it.  You are going to write two programs for this step (<I>ou</I>
and <I>om</I>), which may each be built from single source files,
<CODE>ou.cc</CODE> and <CODE>om.cc</CODE>.  Unless you decide to have
more than one source file for each program, the Makefile for this
project may consist of just the following two lines:

<pre>
      LDLIBS = -lsocket -lnsl
      all : ou om
</pre>

<I>Make</I> automatically adds the <CODE>LDLIBS</CODE> macro to the g++
command any time it uses an implicit rule to invoke the linker
(<I>ld</I>), just as it adds the <CODE>CXXFLAGS</CODE> that you already
know about.  The two libraries named in this macro are needed for any
programs that use sockets.  However, if you build your programs on
<I>qcunix1</I> you have to omit the <CODE>nsl</CODE> library because
they don't use it and it isn't available there.<p>

If you use the <I>strtok_r()</I> function in either of your programs,
you will also have to modify the value of CXXFLAGS in your Makefile:

<pre>
      CXXFLAGS = -g -Wall -D_REENTRANT
</pre>

The two programs will communicate by exchanging datagrams.  Since you
have sample code for stream sockets, but not for datagram sockets, here
are the changes you will have to make to use datagrams:

<OL>

  <LI>The second argument to <I>socket()</I> has to be
  <CODE>SOCK_DGRAM</CODE> instead of <CODE>SOCK_STREAM</CODE>.

  <LI>The server uses <I>bind()</I> to establish its "well known" port
  number, but it does not call <I>listen()</I> or <I>accept()</I>. 
  Instead it calls <I>recvfrom()</I> to receive datagrams as they
  arrive:

<pre>
      bytesReceived = recvfrom( well_known_socket_fd,
                                buffer_to_receive_datagram,
                                sizeof buffer_to_receive_datagram,
                                0,  // Flags: none need to be set.
                                &amp;sockaddr_for_sender,
                                &amp;sockaddr_for_sender_size);
</pre>

  When a datagram arrives, <CODE>sockaddr_for_sender</CODE> will be
  filled in with host address and port number for the datagram sender;
  and sockaddr_for_sender_size is an <I>int</I> that you must
  initialize before each call to <I>recvfrom()</I> with the size of a
  <CODE>sockaddr_in</CODE> struct, and which the kernel will modify
  with the size of the socket address before the call returns.  (This
  is for generality so that datagrams could be sent and received using
  different formats for the socket addresses on the client and server
  ends.  We don't use this feature, but we have to make our code
  consistent with it anyway.)

  <LI>The server can send a datagram back to a client by using the
  <I>sendto()</I> function:

<pre>
      bytesSent = sendto( well_known_socket_fd,
                          message_to_send,
                          strlen(message_send),
                          0,  // Flags: none need to be set.
                          &amp;sockaddr_for_sender,
                          sockaddr_for_sender_size);
</pre>

  The <CODE>sockaddr_for_sender</CODE> would be the same struct that
  was used in the matching call to <I>recvfrom()</I>.  Note that unlike
  <I>recvfrom()</I>, the last argument is a value, not a pointer in
  this function.

  <LI>The client does not use <I>connect()</I>.  Instead it uses
  <I>sendto()</I> to send a datagram message to the server, and then
  uses <I>recvfrom()</I> to get the server's reply.  Since datagrams are
  unreliable, it is possible that a message sent from the client won't
  be received by the server, resulting in no reply!  That means that the
  client might block forever waiting for a reply that isn't coming. 
  Here is some pseudocode to deal with that possibility:

<pre>
      sendto( ... )
      alarm(1)
      br = recvfrom( ... )
      if (-1 == br &amp;&amp; EINTR == errno)
        server did not reply within one second
</pre>

  <LI>Neither the client nor the server uses <I>read()</I> or
  <I>write()</I> for sending messages.  Everything is done using
  <I>sendto()</I> and <I>recvfrom()</I>.

</ol>

Use the last four digits of your social security number as the
well-known port number for your server.  There will be no conflicts
with other students using the lab this semester.  However you have to
have superuser privileges to use port numbers less than 1000, so the
one person whose social security number ends with a number less than
1000 will have to add 1000 to it (or treat the last three digits as a
hexadecimal value).  If for some reason you do need more
port numbers, there will be no conflicts if you use numbers between
your assigned number and that number plus 60.<p>

<center><B><I>om</I> for Use Case 1</B></center>

The object manager accepts any number of command line arguments.  If
the first argument is numeric, it is an alternate value for the
program's well-known port number.  Other than the port number, all
command line arguments are the names of classes to be managed by the
program.  For this use case, the class names may be totally arbitrary
strings.  Build a linked list of these class names.<p>

Create a datagram socket and bind it to your assigned well-known port
number.  When a datagram arrives it will be a <I>request</I> formatted
as a text string with spaces as delimiters between <I>tokens</I>.  The
first token in the datagram is a <I>request type</I> for selecting a
function to call to process the request.  Pass the remainder of the
datagram as a single argument to the appropriate processing function,
which is returns a character string.  Send that string as a
<I>reply</I> to the sender of the request.  Use a <I>dispatch table</I>
as described in class to match request types with processing
functions.  If a request has an unrecognized request type, send the
string "*** unrecognized request ***" to the sender.<p>

For this use case, <I>om</I> recognizes two request types, and processes
them as follows:

<center><table border>
  
  <tr><th>Request<br>Type<th>Argument<br>List<th>Returns
  
  <tr><td align=center><CODE>listClasses</CODE><td
  align=center>Anything<td>The names of all the classes being mangaged,
  separated by newlines.

  <tr><td align=center><CODE>exit</CODE><td
  align=center>Anything<td>Nothing.  Print the argument list, and exit
  <I>om</I>.

</table></center>

Write to stdout each datagram received and each reply sent.<p>

<center><B><I>ou</I> for Use Case 1</B></center>

The first command line argument is the name of the host where <I>om</I>
is running.  If the second command line argument is numeric, it is the
port number to use instead of your well-known port number.  One
additional argument is a string.  Send a datagram to the <I>om</I>
server containing the command line string.  Print the reply that is
returned by <I>om</I>, or an appropriate message if no reply is
received within a reasonable amount of time, and exit.<p>

<center><B>Documentation for Use Case 1</B></center>

Write man pages for <I>ou</I> and <I>om</I>.  Add the following rule to
your Makefile:

<pre>
      install_doc : ou.1 om.1
      &lt;tab&gt;cp -f ou.1 om.1 $(HOME)/man/man1
</pre>

<center><B>Finishing Use Case 1</B></center>

Test both your programs carefully.  Run <I>~vickery/bin/om_1</I> and be
sure your <I>ou</I> works correctly with it.  My default port number is
0x8000 (32768).  Run your <I>om</I> and make sure it works correctly
with <I>~vickery/bin/ou_1</I>.  Be sure your programs work correctly
when run on different computers.  Be sure you can run <I>ou</I> any
number of times before telling <I>om</I> to exit.  Be sure your <I>om</I>
handles invalid requests properly.  Be sure your <I>ou</I> gives an
appropriate message if the host can't be located or if <I>om</I>
doesn't respond.  Make sure the first line of each source file, man
page, and the Makefile is a comment with the <CODE>$Id$</CODE> keyword
in it.  Make sure there is a comment line with the <CODE>$Log$</CODE>
keyword in it in each of these files.<p>

Add the following rule to your Makefile:

<pre>
      install : install_doc ou om
      &lt;tab&gt;cp -f ou om $(HOME)/bin
      &lt;tab&gt;chmod 755 $(HOME)/bin/ou $(HOME)/bin/om
</pre>

<I>Note:</I> Your executable programs must be named <I>ou</I> and
<I>om</I>.  Your source files may be named whatever you like, but when
you pick the names, remember that their names will not change for
different use cases.  I suggest that you use the names
<CODE>om.cc</CODE> and <CODE>ou.cc</CODE>.<p>

Be sure your source code follows the coding guidelines for this course
before proceeding.  You should have been formatting and documenting your
code as you wrote it.  Now is the time to proofread everything to make
sure it looks right.<p>

Check everything into rcs and be sure "make install" builds and
installs everything correctly.  Be sure all the rcs keywords are
expanded correctly in all the source files.  Revise source files, man
pages, and the Makefile and check them in again as necessary.<p>

Double check everything.  It is difficult to get <I>make</I> and rcs to
recreate a use case properly once you start working on the next one.
