<H1 align=center>Object Broker Project-- Use Case 2</H1>

<H3 align=center> Use Case 2 -- <I>om</I> Writes a Log File</H3>

<H3>Modify Your Makefile</H3>

In order to re-build previous use cases using the <CODE>COFLAGS</CODE>
macro, the project directory must be "clean."  For example, if the wrong
version of a <CODE>.cc</CODE> file is already present in the project
directory, <I>make</I> will not check out the proper version because
both version have the same file name and <I>make</I> has no way to tell
the difference.  You can add this rule to your Makefile so that "<I>make
clean</I>" will leave you with a clean project directory:

<pre>
      clean   :
      &lt;tab&gt; rcsclean
      &lt;tab&gt; -ci $(SRCS) $(MANS) Makefile > /dev/zero
      &lt;tab&gt; rm -f core *.o $(PROGS)
      &lt;tab&gt; -rm -i *.cc *.1 *.h
</pre>

The <I>rcsclean</I> command causes rcs to delete any files that are
checked out without locks, provided they are from the latest revision. 
The <I>ci</I> command checks any file that are locked back in.  If
there are no locked files, this command will fail, so the <I>ci</I>
command is prepended with a '-', which tells <I>make</I> to ignore any
errors that result from executing this command.  The standard output
for this command is redirected to <CODE>/dev/zero</CODE> (a
pseudo-device that accepts and discards anything sent to it) to reduce
screen clutter.  The first <I>rm</I> command gets rid of files that can
always be recreated if needed; the "<CODE>-f</CODE>" option makes the
command force removal of files that are read-only without asking you if
it is all right.  This can be dangerous, so the last command forces
<I>rm</I> to ask you if it is all right to delete any man pages or
source files that are still in the project directory.  Again, this
command might fail (if there are no <CODE>.cc</CODE>, <CODE>.1</CODE>,
or <CODE>.h</CODE> files), so the command is prepended with a '-'.<p>

The <CODE>SRCS</CODE>, <CODE>HDRS</CODE>, <CODE>MANS</CODE>, and
<CODE>PROGS</CODE> macros should be set to lists of the
<CODE>.cc</CODE>, <CODE>.h</CODE>, <CODE>.1</CODE> and <CODE>.3</CODE>,
and executable files for the project, respectively.<p>

Check in your new <CODE>Makefile</CODE>.<p>

You aren't going to change <I>ou</I> for this use case, but you need to
have copies of <CODE>ou.cc</CODE> and <CODE>ou.1</CODE> with a revision
level of 2.  Use the following sequence of commands:

<pre>
      % co -l ou.cc ou.1
      % ci -f -r2 ou.cc ou.1
</pre>

Check the <A href="../Handouts/using_rcs.html">the handout page on
Using RCS</A> for more information if this isn't clear.<p>

You will also need a copy of <CODE>Makefile</CODE> with a revision level
of 2, so you should create that now.

<H3>Modify <I>om</I> to Write a Log File</H3>

Server programs normally run as daemon processes that are not attached
to a terminal, and thus cannot write to stdout.  Modify your object
manager so that it creates a log file in the current directory using the
same name as the program (get it from <CODE>argv[0]</CODE>) with
<CODE>.log</CODE> appended to it.  When <I>om</I> starts running it
writes a line to this file with the current date and time and the name
of the host on which it is running.<p>

Each time <I>om</I> receives a datagram, it writes it to the log file,
along with a timestamp and the name of the host that it was sent from. 
Also, when a value is returned to a client, write that datagram to the
log file too.<p>

For example, <I>om</I> running on babbage might generate a log file that
looks like this: 
<pre>
    Tue Dec  9 22:24:39 1997: Object Manager om started on host babbage
    Tue Dec  9 22:25:14 1997: Request from babbage: listClasses
    Tue Dec  9 22:25:14 1997: Reply to babbage: "alpha:beta"
    Tue Dec  9 22:25:14 1997: Request from babbage: bad command
    Tue Dec  9 22:25:14 1997: Reply to babbage: "*** invalid request ***"
    Tue Dec  9 22:26:26 1997: Request from babbage: exit normal shutdown
    Tue Dec  9 22:26:26 1997: Exiting: normal shutdown
</pre>
In this example, the third line shows the names of the classes given on
the <I>om</I> command line separated by ':', but your list might be
separated by newlines.  The last line was generated by in response to
the exit command, but nothing was sent back to the client.<p>

Be sure each line in the log file can be read by a user as soon as it
is written.  If you write to a buffered output file (by using
<I>fwrite()</I>, <I>printf()</I>, or <I>fprintf()</I>, you will have to
flush the output buffer every time you write to the file. 
Alternatively, you can use <I>write()</I> to send messages to the log
file and you won't need to flush any buffers.<p>

<I>Help:</I> You can get the time and date by using the <I>time()</I>
function from the standard library, and you can convert it to text for
printing by using the <I>ctime()</I> function.  You should remove the
'\n' from the end of the string returned by <I>ctime()</I> so that the
timestamp and the name of the host are on the same line of the log file.
You can get the name of the remote host by using <I>gethostbyaddr()</I>.
Pass it the <CODE>struct sockaddr</CODE> that was returned by
<I>recvfrom()</I>, and the <CODE>h_name</CODE> field of the <CODE>struct
hostent</CODE> that is returned will have the string you want.<p>

Make sure your <I>ou</I> works with <CODE>~vickery/bin/om_2</CODE> and
that your <I>om</I> works with <CODE>~vickery/bin/ou_2</CODE><p>

When you finish making changes to <CODE>om.cc</CODE>, check it in as
revision 2:

<pre>
      ci -r2 om.cc
</pre>

<H3>Documentation</H3>

Modify your man page for <I>om</I> so it reflects the changes you made
to the program.  Create a man page for <I>ou</I> with a revision number
of 2 even if you made no changes to it.
