<H3 align=center> Use Case "2a" -- Change Stucture of <I>om</I>
Source Code</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

This part of the project is not really a Use Case because the resulting
program will seem no different to the user from the version of <I>om</I>
that you already built.  In fact, it is possible that you already have
written your program in a way that meets the requirements given here. 
Just make sure that your code meets these requirements before you start
to work on <a href = "a2_usecase_3.html">Use Case 3</a>.<p>

The rationale for this step is that both <I>om</I> and the <I>ob</I> to
be developed for Use Case 3 share some common features, so they should
also share common code where possible.  In particular, both programs
will generate a log file that has a name derived from the name of the
program and which contains a timestamped list of messages.  Also, both
programs receive datagrams that contain <I>requests</I>, which are
strings that are in the general format:

<pre>
      &lt;request type&gt; &lt;argument&gt; ...
</pre>

Both <I>om</I> and <I>ob</I> use the &lt;request type&gt; (sometimes
called the <I>keyword</I>)part of a request to select a <I>request
processing function</I> to be called, and  pass a string consisting of
all the &lt;argument&gt;s separated by spaces to the function.  The
request processing function returns another string, called the
<I>reply</I>.  (A client sends a request in a datagram to <I>om</I> or
<I>ob</I>, and <I>om</I> or <I>ob</I> sends the reply in another
datagram to the client.)<p>

The requirement being introduced here is to implement log file
management and request processing function management in separately
compiled source modules.<p>

<H3>Log File Management</H3>

The interface to the log file could be implemented using two or three
methods, one to open the file, one to write a message to it, and
possibly a third one to close it.  The first method should be passed
argv[0] from <I>main()</I> and do all the work to construct the proper
name for the file and to create it.  The second method should be passed
a string, and should generate a the full log message, including the
timestamp, and write it to the log file.<p>

Put functions prototypes for your log file management functions in a
header file, put their definitions (implementations) in a
<CODE>.cc</CODE> file, and adjust your Makefile so that building
<I>om</I> links the object file for the main program with the object
file for the log file management functions.  Be sure to
<CODE>#include</CODE> the header file in both the source modules.  Here
is what you might have in your Makefile, assuming you have defined the
<CODE>OM_OBJS</CODE> and <CODE>LDFLAGS</CODE> macros properly:

<pre>
      om : $(OM_OBJS)
      &lt;tab&gt; gcc $(OM_OBJS) $(LDFLAGS) -o om 
</pre>

<H3>Request Processing Function Management</H3>

In the <a href="a2_usecase_1.html">description of Use Case 1</a>, you
were told to construct a dispatch table for locating and calling request
processing functions.  Pseudocode for <I>om</I> would include the
following endless loop:

<pre>
      for (;;) {

        1.  Receive a request in a datagram.

        2.  Parse the datagram into two strings, the &lt;request
        type&gt; and the list of &lt;argument&gt;s.
 
        3.  Search for the &lt;request type&gt; in your dispatch
        table, and call the request processing function, passing
        it the second string (the list of &lt;argument&gt;s) as
        its argument.
 
        4.  If the &lt;request type&gt; was not in the
        dispatch table, send a datagram containing the string
        <CODE>"*** unrecognized request ***"</CODE> to the
        client.
 
        5.  If the &lt;request type&gt; <I>was</I> in the dispatch
        table, send a datagram containing the string returned by
        the request processing function to the client.
 
        }
</pre>

Put the code for Steps 2 and 3 of this pseudocode into a separate source
file.  You might have one function or two; I think a single function is
easier to manage.  It would receive the datagram as an argument and
would return either the <CODE>"*** unrecognized request ***"</CODE>
string or whatever string was returned by the request processing
function.  Put the function prototype for this function (these
functions) in a separate header file, and <CODE>#include</CODE> this
header file in both your main program's source file and the source file
containing the function's (functions') definition(s).<p>

What else you do for managing request processing functions depends on
how you implemented your dispatch table.  If you used an array of
structs as described in class, you need to make the array global to
both the main <CODE>.cc</CODE> file and the one that contains the
function(s) just described.  The way to manage that is to declare the
array as an <CODE>extern</CODE> in the header file, and to provide the
initialization of the array in (either) one of the <CODE>.cc</CODE>
files.  Here is some sample code.  (<I>You</I> must use meaningful
function and variable names!)

<center>
<table border=1>
  <tr><th>fun.h<th>om.cc<th>fun.cc

  <tr><td>typedef char *rpf(char *)<br><br>
          rpf do_exit;<br>
          rpf do_listClasses;<br><br>
          struct dt {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;char *n;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;rpf *f;<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;};<br><br>
          extern dt tab[];<br><br>
          // Prototype for parser/dispatcher<br>
          char *p_a_d(char*);

      <td>#include "fun.h"<br><br>
          dt tab[] = {<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;{"exit",        do_exit },<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;{"listClasses", do_listClasses},<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;};<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
          //  Step 2 of above algorithm<br>
          recvfrom ( ... &d ... );<br>
          //  Steps 2 &amp; 3 of above algorithm<br>
          r = p_a_d(d);<br>
          //  Steps 4 &amp; 5 of above algorithm<br>
          sendto( ... r ... );
          

      <td>#include "fun.h"<br>
          char*<br>
          p_a_d(char *k_a) {<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;// Break k_a into k and a<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;// Find k in tab[]<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;// Pass a to the processing function<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;// and return whatever it returns<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;return tab[i].f(a);<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br><br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;}

The decision about where to implement the actual request processing
functions is up to you.  They could be defined in either of these
<CODE>.cc</CODE> files, or in yet another one.  (Don't forget to
<code>#include</code> the header file if you use another one.)<p>

If you decide instead to use an object-oriented approach, you would
have a class that holds the dispatch table and which has member
functions for adding items to the table and for searching the table for
a particular request type string.  In this implementation, the class
declaration goes in the header file, and the class method definitions
go in a separate <CODE>.cc</CODE> file.  You might reasonably decide to
implement the dispatch table as a linked list if you follow this
approach.<p>

In either case, you will now need to update the definitions of
<CODE>OM_OBJS</CODE> in your Makefile, and you will have to be sure to
update the dependencies for each object module to include the proper header
files:

<pre>
      depend : $(OM_SRCS) $(HDRS)
      &lt;tab&gt; makedepend $(OM_SRCS)
</pre>
