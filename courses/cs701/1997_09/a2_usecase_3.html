<H3 align=center> Use Case 3 -- The Object Broker First Appears</H3>

<H3>Introduction</H3>

The object broker is a third program that acts as an intermediary
between object managers and object users.  The idea is that there might
be several object managers running on the network, and users shouldn't
have to know about where they are in order to use them.  Instead, object
users will contact a single well-known object broker to find out what
classes are being managed by what object managers.  Object users will
then interact with object managers by going through the object
broker.<p>

This and the next use case will develop the basic communication
patterns among the the object user, object broker, and object manager
programs.  This case will establish communication between the object
broker and the object user, the next case will add communication between
the object manager and the object broker, and case five will establish
communication between a user and a manager through the broker.  Use
cases beyond that will implement more of the details of the CSSOOOBP
protocol.

<H3>Description</H3>

The object broker for this use case is almost identical to the object
manager you developed for Use Case #2.  The difference is in the set of
request types that it recognizes:

<center><table border>
  
  <tr><th>Request<br>Type
      <th>Argument<br>List
      <th>Return<br>Value
      <th>Action
  
  <tr><td align=center><CODE>hello</CODE>
      <td align=center>Anything
      <td>"Hello acknowledged"
      <td>Write a message to the log file that includes a unique name
      for the program that sent the request.  See below for details.

  <tr><td align=center><CODE>good-bye</CODE>
      <td align=center>Anything
      <td>"Good-bye acknowledged"
      <td>Nothing

  <tr><td align=center><CODE>list</CODE>
      <td align=center>Anything
      <td>A string that includes the Argument List.  Say something like,
      "List &lt;Arg List&gt; not implemented." in the string.
      <td>Nothing

  <tr><td align=center><CODE>shutdown</CODE>
      <td align=center>Anything
      <td>Nothing
      <td>Write a message to the log file that includes the Argument
      List as part of the message, then exit <I>ob</I>.

</table></center><p>

In the next use case, the "hello" and "good-bye" requests will come from
<I>om</I>, but for this use case, we will use <I>ou</I> to send them to
<I>ob</I>.  For this use case, you can use the same <I>ou</I> that you
used in the previous cases, and <I>om</I> is not used at all.<p>

The unique name for a program that is mentioned for "hello" requests is
to be in the form &lt;hostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;, for example,
"jaguar:10F3".  Given the <CODE>sockaddr_in</CODE> struct that is
filled in by a call to <I>recvfrom()</I>, you can get the
&lt;hostname&gt; by calling <I>gethostbyaddr()</I> and the integer
value of remote program's port from the <CODE>sin_port</CODE> field of
the <CODE>sockaddr_in</CODE> struct.<p>

In my implementation I used global variables for the &lt;hostname&gt;
and the <CODE>sockaddr_in</CODE> struct because the call to
<I>recvfrom()</I> is in one part of the program (<I>main()</I>) and the
"hello" request is processed in a separate function whose prototype
allows only one string argument to be passed to it. You might be able
to think of a way to avoid this use of global variables cleanly.<p>

<H3>Documentation</H3>

You do not need to change your <I>man</I> page for <I>om</I>, but your
should check in a copy with revision number 3.1 as part of proper
project management.  The <I>man</I> page for <I>ou</I> needs to be
updated to show what the user may type on the command line and to tell
what "hello," "good-bye," "list," and "shutdown" requests will do.  You
will need to mention <I>ob</I> in your <I>ou</I> <I>man</I> page, but
refer the reader to the separate man page for <I>ob</I> in the SEE ALSO
section of the page for <I>ou</I>.<p>

The <I>man</I> page for <I>ob</I>, like the pages for other network
servers, is oriented more towards users who need to know how to start
and stop the server than for end-users.  It would be appropriate to list
the request types that <I>ob</I> recognizes and to tell what those
requests would be used for.  Don't describe the internal logic of
<I>ob</I>, that should be done in the comments in the code.
