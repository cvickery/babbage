<H3 align=center> Use Case 5 -- <I>ou</I> and <I>om</I> Communicate
Through <I>ob</I></H3>

<H3>Changes to <I>ou</I></H3>

None.  Just be sure your <I>ou</I> can pass a request with three tokens
to <I>ob</I> and display whatever comes back.  For this case, the user
may type requests with the following syntax on the command line:<p>

<pre>
      % ou &lt;broker&gt; [port] list classes &lt;manager&gt;
</pre>

The scenario is that the user will use a "list managers" request to find
out what <I>om</I> programs are available, and then will use a "list
classes" request to find out what classes are being managed by a
particular <I>om</I>.

<H3>Changes to <I>om</I></H3>

None.  This version of <I>om</I> behaves the same as the one for Use
Case 4.

<H3>Changes to <I>ob</I></H3>

Now <I>ob</I> must recognize both "list managers" and "list classes"
requests.  In the case of "list classes" the <I>ob</I> sends a
"listClasses" request to the appropriate <I>om</I>, receives a reply
from the <I>om</I> and sends that reply back unchanged as its own reply
to <I>ou</I>.

<H3>Documentation</H3>

Update your <I>man</I> page for <I>ou</I> to document the new command
line option and the <I>man</I> page for <I>ob</I> to document the new
request type.
