
Here is a list of topics that might be tested on the final
exam.  The chapter references include material on the topics
listed as well as other material not touched on in class.
You are responsible for picking out the relevant parts.

The exam will be a mixture of code writing, which will be
based on (but not the same as) code written for the
assignments, and short answer questions.
