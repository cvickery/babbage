          NAME</B>
                 strtoul - convert a string to an unsigned long integer.
          
          <B>SYNOPSIS</B>
                 #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
          
                 unsigned long int strtoul(const char *nptr, char **endptr,
                 int base)
          
          <B>DESCRIPTION</B>
                 The  strtoul()  function converts the string in nptr to an
                 unsigned long integer value according to the  given  base,
                 which  must  be between 2 and 36 inclusive, or be the spe­
                 cial value 0.
          
                 The string must begin with an arbitrary  amount  of  white
                 space  (as  determined by isspace(3)) followed by a single
                 optional `+' or `-' sign.  If base  is  zero  or  16,  the
                 string may then include a `0x' prefix, and the number will
                 be read in base 16; otherwise, a zero base is taken as  10
                 (decimal)  unless the next character is `0', in which case
                 it is taken as 8 (octal).
          
                 The remainder of the string is converted  to  an  unsigned
                 long  int  value  in  the  obvious manner, stopping at the
                 first character which is not a valid digit  in  the  given
                 base.   (In bases above 10, the letter `A' in either upper
                 or lower case represents 10, `B'  represents  11,  and  so
                 forth, with `Z' representing 35.)
          
                 If endptr is not NULL, strtoul() stores the address of the
                 first invalid character in *endptr.  If there were no dig­
                 its at all, strtoul() stores the original value of nptr in
                 *endptr.  (Thus, if *nptr is not `\0' but **endptr is `\0'
                 on return, the entire string is valid.)
          
          <B>RETURN VALUE</B>
                 The  strtoul()  function  returns either the result of the
                 conversion or, if there was  a  leading  minus  sign,  the
                 negation of the result of the conversion, unless the orig­
                 inal (non-negated) value would  overflow;  in  the  latter
                 case,  strtoul()  returns  ULONG_MAX  and  sets the global
                 variable errno to ERANGE.
          
          <B>ERRORS</B>
                 ERANGE The given string was out of range; the  value  con­
                        verted has been clamped.
