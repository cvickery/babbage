<h1>Length of an Array</h1>
</center>

A common problem in C is to deal with arrays which don't
have a "natural" length.  If you can determine the length
needed when an array is declared, you just declare the
length of the array inside the square brackets of the
delclaration.  And if you can determine the size needed when
the program is running you can use <i>malloc()</i> to
allocate the memory for the array.<p>

But sometimes there is no way of knowing how big to make the
array, so you pick a size that seems "big enough" but not "too
big."  The problem, of course, is that your ideas about how
big "big enough" and "not too big" are might change, and you
have to recompile the program with a bigger or smaller
length for the array.<p>

A variation on this problem is when you make up a table,
like a dispatch table, to which you will want to add entries
as the project develops.<p>

In both cases, you want to (a) minimize the number of code
changes you need to make to change the size of the array,
and (b) write code that stays within the bounds of the
array, even when the size of the array changes.<p>

<h2>Named Constants</h2>

If you are going to pick the length of an array and there is
any chance that the length might need to be changed later,
use a named literal constant to specify the size of the array, and
use the name wherever code loops through the elements of the
array.  To change the size of the array, just change the
value of the named constant and all the code will adjust to
deal with the new length automatically.<p>

Use the preprocessor directive, <code>#define</code> to
define a named constant.  Whatever appears after the
constant name on the #define line becomes the value
associated with the name.  The preprocessor then substitutes
the value wherever the name appears in the code before
passing the code on to the compiler for translation into
assembly language.  The <code>#define</code> statement goes
near the beginning of the file so it will be easy to find
and change.<p>

<pre>
      #define NUM_FRIBBLES 12
      . . .
      int fribble[ NUM_FRIBBLES ];
      . . . 
      for ( int i = 0; i &lt; NUM_FRIBLES; i++ ) ...

</pre>

<h2>Adjustable Arrays</h2>

You can get the compiler to determine the length of an array
by providing a list of initializer values when you declare
it:

<pre>
      int frobble[] = { 1, 3, 5, 6, 2, 4, };
</pre>

Now you need some way to find out the length so you can use
it to limit loops, etc.  You can use the <i>sizeof</i>
operator to find out how many bytes of memory the array
occupies.  If you divide that by the size of one element of
the array, you get its length:

<pre>
      const int numFrobbles = sizeof( frobble ) / sizeof( int );
</pre>

Now you can use <code>numFrobbles</code> in your code just
the way you would use <code>NUM_FRIBBLES</code> in the
previous example.<p>
