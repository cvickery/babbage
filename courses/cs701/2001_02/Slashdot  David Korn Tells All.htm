dept.</B></FONT><BR>David Korn answers! <A 
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/01/25/2320255">You asked the 
questions</A> a little while ago, and now David Korn has kindly responded with 
answers (some lengthy, some pithy, all appreciated) to queries about the 
eponymous shell, the famous Microsoft/Korn story (in short -- yep, it's like 
you've heard), and proper Unix behavior. He even made his son Adam write one of 
the answers. <BR>
<P><STRONG>Question 1) Comparison<BR>by Shadowlion (shadowlionc@netscape.net) 
</STRONG>
<P><I>Background: the only shell I've ever really used is bash. Bash has always 
seemed to be the standard UNIX shell (or, at least, the standard default UNIX 
shell), and for the most part I've always been able to do what I wanted in it.
<P>Question: can you engage in a little unadulterated advocacy for a moment to 
offer some reasons why an informed user might consider using ksh over bash or 
other popular UNIX shells? What does ksh provide that other shells don't? 
Similarly, can you give a realistic appraisal of ksh's drawbacks as compared to 
bash or other shells?
<P>Thanks.
<P></I><STRONG>David Korn: </STRONG>First of all, when I talk about ksh here, I 
am referring to ksh93 which was first released over six years ago. Most UNIX 
systems ship with ksh88 and most Linux systems ship with pdksh, neither of which 
has the functionality of ksh93.
<P>There are two different areas of functionality in shells. First is 
interactive use and the second is scripting. Much of the debate about shells has 
focused on interactive use only. For example, tcsh is an acceptable shell for 
interactive use but practically unusable for scripting.
<P>In many cases the argument over which shell is best for interactive use is 
based upon which key to press for completion. This is a little like arguing that 
Solaris is better than Windows because of location of the Control and Shift keys 
or that vi is better than emacs because you you can save a keystroke or two. 
Most popular shells have similar functionality with respect to interactive use.
<P>It is hard to argue that ksh is any better for interaction, given all the 
features in tcsh and zsh. But the scripting features in ksh93 are far more 
advanced than any other shell that I am aware of. For scripting, I feel that ksh 
is more in the category of perl/tcl/python and I would like to see 
debates/comparisons for those languages rather than the antiquated bash/csh/etc.
<P>I have not looked at bash for several years and some of the features I 
describe here might now be implemented by bash. I sent Chet Ramey, author of 
bash, the list of new features in ksh93 years ago so that if these features get 
implemented in bash, they would be compatible. Here is a partial list of ksh93 
features: 
<OL>
  <LI>Associative arrays - ksh88 already supports indexed arrays. 
  <LI>Floating point arithmetic + math library functions. 
  <LI>Arithmetic for command similar to C and awk. 
  <LI>Complete ANSI C printf formatting with extensions. 
  <LI>Run time linking of libraries and builtins. 
  <LI>A number of additional substring operations such as offset length. 
  <LI>Full extended regular expression matching capabilities 
  <LI>Compound variables which can be used to represent data aggregates. 
  <LI>Name references for passing aggregate variables by name. 
  <LI>Active variables. Users can trap variable assignment and references by 
  associating intercept functions of the form name.get and name.set. 
  <LI>Ability to make socket connections to servers by name. 
  <LI>read with timeouts. 
  <LI>Conformance to POSIX 1003.2. 
  <LI>Command completion and variable completion, ksh93 only had file name 
  completion. 
  <LI>A key binding mechanism that allows users to bind keys to new editing 
  functions. </LI></OL>Note that only the last two features relate to interactive 
use. The primary focus of ksh93 is scripting and in this arena it certainly 
outshines bash. ksh93 runs builtin shell commands much faster than bash.
<P>There is actually a third area of shell functionality which is related to 
extensibility. In this area ksh93 should be compared to tcl. ksh93 is 
implemented as a reusable library with a C language API for adding builtins and 
accessing shell internals. It can be embedded in other programs. For example, 
dtksh, which is part of the Common Desktop Environment (CDE), uses ksh93 as a 
library. Similarly, tksh, (written by Jeff Korn) which uses the tk library for 
graphics, uses ksh93 as a library.
<P>The primary drawback to ksh has been that it was proprietary. This has 
recently changed however. The new AT&amp;T open source license allows ksh source 
and binaries to be shipped as part of the system and is now just beginning to 
start showing up in Linux systems; for example the latest slackware. The source 
or binary for over a dozen architectures can be downloaded from 
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/download). Hopefully other systems will start 
shipping ksh93 and start using this for /bin/sh as well.
<P><STRONG>Question 2) What about enhancing ksh syntax?<BR>by mirko 
(mirko@myfamilyname.org) </STRONG>
<P><I>Ksh is quite cool as it is much more compact than bash ; here are their 
respective sizes on a Solaris system:
<P>-&gt; /usr/local/bin/bash -version<BR>GNU bash, version 2.02.0(1)-release 
(sparc-sun-solaris2.6)<BR>Copyright 1998 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
<P>-&gt; ls -la /usr/local/bin/bash<BR>-rwxr-xr-x 1 bin bin 3157516 Jul 14 1998 
/usr/local/bin/bash<BR># ksh -o emacs<BR># Version M-11/16/88i
<P># ls -la `which ksh`<BR>-r-xr-xr-x 2 bin bin 186356 Jul 16 1997 /usr/bin/ksh
<P>On a Linux system, these are approximately 300k for bash and 160k for 
(pd)ksh.
<P>In which direction do you plan to improve it?
<P>Will you rather keep it compact or extend its functionalities regardless the 
volume increase ?
<P>This issue is quite important for me as, as of yet I am working upon some 
System-on-a-floppy distribution and the size appears to be critical in this 
context.
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>First of all pdksh is a ksh88 clone; and I might 
add a better clone than the MKS Korn Shell.
<P>A lot of effort was made to keep ksh88 small. In fact the size you report on 
Solaris is without stripping the symbol table. The size that I am getting for 
ksh88i on Solaris is 160K and the size on NetBSD on intel is 135K.
<P>ksh88 was able to compile on machines that only allowed 64K text. There were 
many compromises to this approach. I gave up on size minimization with ksh93. 
ksh93 is larger than bash. However, because of the number of commands that can 
be builtin to ksh93, it is possible to put ksh93 and approximately 30 additional 
commands on a floppy in approximately the same space as with ksh88 and those 
commands.
<P>Some of the reasons for the large size of ksh93 are: 
<OL>
  <LI>Floating point arithmetic. 
  <LI>The use of Sfio for Stdio. Use of the native stdio would not have counted 
  towards the size on most systems because they are part of the shared C 
  library. However, Stdio has too many weaknesses to be used portably and safely 
  by ksh. 
  <LI>Self-documenting code. All the built-ins to ksh93 can generate their own 
  manual page in several formats and locales. This takes up space for the 
  documentation text as well the the processing libraries. 
</LI></OL><STRONG>Question 3) pdksh...<BR>by mirko 
(mirko@myfamilyname.org)</STRONG>
<P><I>Do you collaborate (or plan to) with the pdksh development team ?
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>I don't know the pdksh development team but I 
would like to thank them for the service they have done in making a version of 
ksh available while ksh was proprietary. I have noticed remarkable improvements 
in pdksh in its ability to mimic ksh88 functionality. I don't know what plans 
the pdksh development team has now that ksh93 is available in open source form, 
but I certainly would help them try to maintain compatibility if they do 
continue pdksh distribution. Otherwise, I would hope that they would pick up the 
ksh93 source and help support and enhance it.
<P><STRONG>Question 4) ksh today<BR>by Y-Leen
<P></STRONG>
<P><I>During the design of ksh, were you limited/influenced by computer hardware 
and consumer market?
<P>Given the chance to completely redesign ksh for today's higher spec machines 
and the current consumer base, what new features would you include?
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>In many ways yes. In early days memory size was a 
big consideration. [That] sixteen bit machines were the norm influenced the 
design. The fork() call on most systems caused the data area to be copied in the 
child process and therefore keeping the data region as small as possible was 
needed for performance reasons.
<P>Another design principle that was influenced by the hardware and the OS was 
the desire to only have features that would work on all systems so that korn 
shell scripts would be portable.
<P>The decision to keep ksh compatible with the Bourne shell was influenced by 
the consumer base. There are very few Bourne shell scripts that will not run 
unchanged with ksh.
<P>In a complete redesign, all shell functions would be thread safe so that 
multiple shell interpreters could run in separate threads.
<P>There are two features that are missing the current ksh93 release that are 
present in perl and should be added to a future release. One is the ability to 
handle and process binary data. The second is related to name spaces.
<P><STRONG>Question 5) True Story?<BR>by travisd (travisd_no_spam@tubas.net)
<P></STRONG><I>Was the story about you embarrassing a Microsoftie at a 
conference true? Specifically, that he was insisting that their implementation 
of ksh in their unix compatibility kit was true to the "real" thing and trying 
to argue the point with you. The argument ended when someone else finally stood 
up and informed the speaker who he was arguing with.
<P>Just curious ...
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>This story is true. It was at a USENIX Windows NT 
conference and Microsoft was presenting their future directions for NT. One of 
their speakers said that they would release a UNIX integration package for NT 
that would contain the Korn Shell.
<P>I knew that Microsoft had licensed a number of tools from MKS so I came to 
the microphone to tell the speaker that this was not the "real" Korn Shell and 
that MKS was not even compatible with ksh88. I had no intention of embarrassing 
him and thought that he would explain the compromises that Microsoft had to make 
in choosing MKS Korn Shell. Instead, he insisted that I was wrong and that 
Microsoft had indeed chosen a "real" Korn Shell. After a couple of exchanges, I 
shut up and let him dig himself in deeper. Finally someone in the audience stood 
up and told him what almost everyone in the audience knew, that I had written 
the 'real' Korn Shell. I think that this is symbolic about the way the company 
works.
<P><STRONG>Question 6) Kind of a shell question...<BR>by update()
<P></STRONG><I>There's a lot of squabbling in the Linux world about how the Unix 
mentality of small apps communicating through standard input/output to form a 
pipeline should be maintained in the new whiz-bang, GUI environments. Do you 
think that it can/should be done? What should be the most important 
considerations for such a messaging system and how should a standard be 
established?
<P>So Korn (the band) drinks Coors Light? I might have suspected... </I>
<P><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>As far as the Korn band is concerned, as you probably 
already know, it was formed in 1993 to promote the Korn Shell. On the 
kornshell.com website (click on fun), you can see them endorsing the KornShell 
Command and Programming Language book, the most complete reference book on 
ksh93.
<P>There are many people who use UNIX or Linux who IMHO do not understand UNIX. 
UNIX is not just an operating system, it is a way of doing things, and the shell 
plays a key role by providing the glue that makes it work. The UNIX methodology 
relies heavily on reuse of a set of tools rather than on building monolithic 
applications. Even perl programmers often miss the point, writing the heart and 
soul of the application as perl script without making use of the UNIX toolkit.
<P>Our aim with ksh, and with about 150 additional tools that are part of the 
AST Toolkit, (http://www.research.att.com/sw/download), has been to enhance the 
UNIX tool kit by providing new and improved tools.
<P>Clearly most users prefer GUI interfaces, and GUI interfaces are often 
hostile to the UNIX methodology. This presents a challenge for the GUI design 
and unfortunately many GUI applications are built as monoliths with little hope 
of reuse and make little reuse of the UNIX tool set. I think that the most 
important consideration when building a system is to separate the GUI from the 
rest of the system. Anything that can be done with the GUI should be able to be 
done without the GUI via scripting. This is important if you ever want to 
automate tasks in the future. Scripting can then be used for automation and for 
testing.
<P>This tight coupling between GUI and application has other drawbacks as well. 
It makes it hard to distribute functionality from the client running the GUI to 
a server that could be somewhere else on the network.
<P><STRONG>Question 7) What functionality/code in ksh are you least proud 
of?<BR>by segmond (segmond[at]hotmail)
<P></STRONG><I>It is very hard to find a programmer who is completely satisfied 
with his code. No matter how happy she is with it, there is always that part 
which she wishes to improve. As far as ksh is concerned what is it that you wish 
you didn't do, can improve? </I>
<P><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>The things that I most regret are not the code itself 
but mistakes that are in the shell language that I inherited from the Bourne 
shell code. A lot of effort was made to maintain compatibility while trying to 
improve ksh at the same time. Compatibility was an extremely important 
consideration for the adoption of ksh by may organizations. At one point I 
backed out an improvement because it broke one script in a published UNIX book. 
If I had my choice, the backquote would disappear as a special character and $() 
would need to be used instead. Double quoted strings would interpret all of the 
ANSI-C backslash conventions as well as expand $ expansions. The echo command 
would not perform any interpretation on its argument. Word splitting would be 
disabled by default. Note that because I did not make these changes, ksh can 
safely replace /bin/sh on most systems today unlike zsh which would cause many 
script to fail in mysterious ways.
<P>There are also a number of features that I introduced into the shell that I 
wish that I had done differently or not at all. Some obvious examples are the 
poor design of the fc command, the let command which was superceded with 
((...)), and the exporting of attributes for shell variables. 
<P>The code has changed a lot over the years which I suspect is an indication 
that I am never completely satisfied with my code. In fact whenever I look at 
code I wrote a few years ago, I can't believe how bad it is and I always believe 
that my new code is finally ok.
<P>What bothers me most about the current code, is that, in spite of its 
modularity, there are too many places where code in one module only works 
because of the way another module works. The effect of this is that many changes 
that I make are not orthogonal and require changes to several parts of the code.
<P>Another weakness of the current code is that it is not completely thread 
safe.
<P><STRONG>Question 8) UWIN and etc<BR>by rabtech (russ_slash@boneville.net)
<P></STRONG><I>You once said that you had to learn Windows NT because you 
couldn't criticize what you didn't know. What I'd like to know (as a primarily 
Windows programmer) is what do you consider to be the best and worst parts of 
both the Windows NT/2000 model and the UNIX model. What advice can you give? 
Also, has working on the UWIN project given you any insights that you can share 
with the rest of the community?
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>I have spent the last five years writing a UNIX 
for windows which is called UWIN (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin). My 
experience is with the WIN32 API for the core OS and not with the WIN32 
interface to the GUI. Clearly I had to learn more about the WIN32 API than I 
think that anyone should need to know. The more I know about the WIN32 API the 
more I dislike it. It is complex and for the most part poorly designed, 
inconsistent, and poorly documented.
<P>One of the biggest myths about Windows is that the MS operating systems are 
compatible, unlike UNIX which has so many variants. In reality, porting from one 
version of Windows to another is often more difficult than porting from one UNIX 
or Linux system to another. WIN32 calls on one system are not necessarily 
implemented on other systems, or even worse, they behave differently, requiring 
completely different code strategies.
<P>That is not to say that there aren't things that I like about Windows NT. The 
handle model is good, but would have been better if Microsoft had done it right. 
The separation of dynamic libraries into interface and implementation also makes 
sense. Putting the libraries in the same directory as the executables is an 
improvement over UNIX since the allows executables and libraries to be searched 
for simultaneously.
<P>The best advice I can give is to not use Windows unless you have to, or if 
you have to, use a UNIX operating system on top of Windows like UWIN or Cygwin.
<P>One insight that I would give about UWIN is that it proved to be far more 
difficult that I had anticipated.
<P><STRONG>Question 9) Ksh Programming For the Web<BR>by Dom2 
(dom@happygiraffe.net)
<P></STRONG><I>How do you feel that ksh holds up for web programming? I have 
always enjoyed programming shell scripts more than anything else, but I have 
always been unhappy with the shell idioms for parsing securely and correctly 
(the myriad of substitution operators is a nightmare to control). This is one 
area in which Perl has really taken the lead. How do you think shell programming 
could be better adapted for the web?
<P>Also, how do you feel about most commercial Unix vendors (and projects like 
pdksh) that are still shipping ksh88 as the default, 13 years later? ksh93 has 
many more useful features, but the take up has been slow.
<P>Thanks,<BR>-Dom
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>One of my biggest disappointments is the slowness 
of adoption of ksh93. At the time ksh88 was released, AT&amp;T was a primary 
UNIX vendor and was able to put it into the standard product. This led to 
relatively quick adoption for most vendors.
<P>Shell features like here-documents are very well suited for CGI scripts. 
However, ksh93 is far better as a web scripting language than ksh88. There is 
not an efficient way to handle the myriad of substitution operators that get 
passed into a CGI script with ksh88 or any other shell. ksh93 does this rather 
efficiently with a 'set' discipline which converts the CGI command line into a 
single compound variable for manipulation by the script. A 'get' discipline 
converts it back.
<P>The kornshell.com page has the code for a script that can be included in a 
CGI script in which all the arguments are mapped into shell variables.
<P>Also, recent version of ksh93 have added %H to printf so that strings can be 
expanded using HTML/XML %xx; form whenever necessary.
<P>The http://www.research.att.com/sw/download website is maintained by ksh 
scripts in combination with AT&amp;T nmake, and all CGI scripting is done by 
ksh93.
<P><STRONG>Question 10) Graphical dtksh, zend, standardizing on ksh93, rpm<BR>by 
emil
<P></STRONG><I>a) Since the code to Motif is now free and open, is there any 
possibility that dtksh, the ksh93-compliant CDE shell with Motif extensions will 
be open-sourced? Novel wrote it; will they give it away?
<P>b) Any possibility that you could leverage Zend from php? Or what would it 
take to implement a dbi-like SQL layer for ksh?
<P>c) Under Solaris and HP-UX, ksh88 is installed in /usr/bin/ksh, ksh93 is 
installed in /usr/dt/bin/dtksh, but the default shell is the "Posix" shell, a 
superset of ksh. Is there any hope of getting this mess straightened out?
<P>d) Will I ever expect Red Hat to include an RPM for ksh93? Or would you 
consider merging with Bash?
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>a) I can't say whether Novell will give dtksh away 
or not. They own the ksh93 extensions and its up to them what they do. I don't 
think that Motif is either free or open since my understanding is that it cannot 
be included in commercial products. On the other hand, tksh, which combines 
ksh93 with tk graphics is freely available. In addition to interpreting shell 
syntax, tksh can interpret tcl syntax as well.
<P>b) I am not familiar with Zend from php. ksh93 is very extensible. Builtins 
can be added to ksh and use the same calling convention as tcl uses. There is an 
API interface to shell variables and other shell functions that can be used with 
built-in commands. If Zend from php can be added to tcl, then it can be added to 
ksh93.
<P>c) Since ksh88 is not fully POSIX compliant, some system vendors have 
modified ksh88 to make it compliant and used that for their POSIX shell. One way 
to clean up this mess is to get all the vendors to move to ksh93. ksh93 has a 
single source that compiles on all systems from pc,'s mac's, unix systems, and 
mainframes. I have no say over what vendors do, but users on these systems 
certainly can state their preferences.
<P>d) I would hope that Red Hat and other Linux and UNIX vendors would pick up 
ksh93 and distribute it at least as /bin/ksh. There is no reason why it could 
not be used as /bin/sh as well and I suspect that it could be merged with bash. 
We will soon be offering RPMs for the entire AST library from the AT&amp;T 
website.
<P><STRONG>Question 11) UWIN and Cygwin<BR>by Lumpish Scholar 
(psrchisholm@yahoo.com)
<P></STRONG><I>How would you compare the UWIN and Cygwin projects?</I>
<P><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>I believe that UWIN and Cygwin started at about the 
same time although I don't believe that either knew about the other for the 
first year or two. The focus for Cygwin seemed to be primarily GNU tools rather 
than a more complete integration. The primary focus on UWIN was to make the AST 
tools described in now the out of print book "Practical Reusable UNIX Software", 
run without change on Windows NT and Windows 95.
<P>Cygwin has the advantage of being an OpenSource project whereas UWIN is not, 
although hopefully this will change in the not too distant future. However, UWIN 
binaries have been freely available for educational and research use, and 
available for 90 day evaluation for commercial use. As a result there are more 
than 100,000 UWIN users and this has helped in discovering problems. The source 
for nearly all of the UWIN commands are available in open source.
<P>Cygwin relies on the gcc compilation system. UWIN tries to be compiler 
neutral and works with gcc and Visual C/C++. Since it works with the Visual 
C/C++ compiler, it is easier to integrate UWIN code with native Visual C/C++ 
modules.
<P>The website http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/uwin/survey.html allows 
users to compare UWIN with other alternatives such as Cygwin in for different 
categories. The feedback that I have received shows that in most instances UWIN 
receives higher marks than Cygwin, especially in performance.
<P></I><STRONG>Question 12) ksh93 as a programming language?<BR>by Lumpish 
Scholar (psrchisholm@yahoo.com)
<P></STRONG><I>What are some of the differences between ksh88 (which I think of 
as comparable to bash or the Posix shell) and ksh93, that makes the latest 
KornShell as good or better a language than Perl?
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>In question 1 I gave a quick summary of ksh93 
features that distinguish it from ksh88 and from other shells. For the most part 
ksh93 has the functionality of perl 5 and arguably a more readable syntax. In 
most instances the performance is similar. Scripts that interact heavily with 
the file system or use pipelines tend to be better suited for shell scripting.
<P><STRONG>Question 13) So, Dave ...<BR>by An Unnamed Correspondent
<P></STRONG><I>Quick question: Vi or Emacs?
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>This is an old battle that was raging in the early 
'80s. It will never be settled. This is why ksh has both edit modes. It partly 
depends on whether you use the editor as a command or as an environment. I think 
of an editor as a command that I can quickly start and leave and I think of the 
shell as an environment which holds state. vi fits this model better and that is 
what I use.
<P>I use several versions of vi depending on which system I am on. UWIN uses nvi 
from BSD.
<P><STRONG>Question 14) Public Apology<BR>by watanabe (petervNOMEATivcfne.org)
<P></STRONG><I>Dear Dr. Korn, I feel I owe you an apology, and this seemed like 
a great chance! I went to school with Adam at Brown. And, in 1993, my roommate, 
Matt Smith, woke me up at about midnight, excitedly telling me "Do you know the 
Korn Shell? This guy's dad wrote the Korn shell!!!" He was coming in with Adam 
from somewhere.
<P>I sort of turned over in my sleep, (I was extremely groggy), and said "I hate 
the Korn shell." and went back to bed. Adam never really talked to me after 
that, although he was polite enough to me at parties.
<P>So, Dr. Korn, I feel I owe you an apology. I didn't mean to disrespect your 
lifework in front of your son! I still can't use the korn shell, but call it 
fear of the unknown, please, rather than lucid comments on your code.
<P>Peter Vessenes, Brown '97
<P></I><STRONG>Korn: </STRONG>Since I could not recall the incident, I asked by 
son Adam to respond to this. Here is his response:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Peter,
  <P>Thanks for clearing things up! In my memory of the incident, we had woken 
  you up that evening and I thought you said to me, "I hate the Korn smell." I 
  was mortified! That was the first time anyone ever (publicly) accused me of 
  having b.o., and your comment gave me quite a complex for the many months that 
  followed. I avoided you at all social gatherings because I was scared to death 
  that you might mention this in front of others. I am relieved to learn that 
  this was all the result of a simple miscommunication. 
  <P>To be honest, I have no recollection of this incident. I do appreciate your 
  apology, but it is not necessary -- just as people are entitled to their 
  choice of music, art, religion, etc, they too should have the right to pick 
  their favorite shell. I'm just thankful I'm not the son of Bill Gates!
  <P>Best,<BR>Adam
  <P></P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<HR>
<I>Our thanks to David for his responses, and likewise to Adam for his.</I>

      <P>Hmmm... I'd like to see a shell that provides a command-line, 
      programmatic interface to some of the Linux desktop librarys (GNOME, KDE)

              <P>I think the issue is that programming is largely a verbal, 
              logical thing rather than visual. I've yet to see a visual 
              programming environment that really doesn't boil down to a "so 
              what" at the end of the day. IBMs visual age stuff is fairly nice, 
              but mainly because it gets out of the way in a hurry when you 
              really need to get down to brass tacks. <BR><BR>I think the shell 
              as programming environment is a kind of curious historical 
              accident that worked out really well in conjuction with a broad 
              variety of filter-ish applications. If you think about it, there 
              is little reason why your shell should be your primary glue 
              language for all kinds of applications, other than you happen to 
              be spending a lot of time typing in it if you are on a non-gui 
              system. <BR><BR>If you relieve the application of having to be 
              your primary mode of interaction with the file system and for 
              launching applications, you can look at various applications as 
              repositories of objects to be used rather than processes to be 
              evoked. Yes, I know you can do more with shell scripting, but this 
              is the sort of task shell scripting is natural for -- to evoke a 
              series of small tools that perform simple kinds of transformations 
              on a file system or data stream. These are highly useful, but 
              aren't the entire universe of scripting applications. <BR><BR>It's 
              been a few years, but the nicest example of of system scripting 
              I've ever seen is Applescript. In MacOS, applications tell the 
              system about objects and methods that they are willing to expose. 
              They are essentially self documenting. These objects can be 
              manipulated through low level APIs, but they can also be accessed 
              by Applescript via a form of message passing. Applescript was a 
              very small, simple and relatively clean scripting language. It had 
              various sugary constructs that allowed you to make script lines 
              sound like reading English sentences, but they were tastefully 
              done and they weren't obtrusive if you liked things terse. Apple 
              provided a small interactive editor/interpreter environment 
              (vaguely a la WISH or IDLE but less funky) which could inspect the 
              self documenting features of the applications' objects. Scripts 
              could then be saved and run like Unix shell scripts. 
              <BR><BR>Applescript was sort of like a cleanly done VBA, but it's 
              real strength was that it was a tidy way to coordinate a number of 
              processes whose lifespan were not related in any preconceived way 
              to the lifespan of the script and do itneract with them in a very 
              flexible way. In that sense it was kind of like workign with 
              application COM services. Integration with the Finder gave you the 
              kind of shell script capabilities you'd expect in Unix. 
              <BR><BR>I've been out of the Mac world now for six or seven years, 
              but they were definitely way ahead of their time. Applescript was 
              a relly valuable technology that was hurt by Apple's failure to 
              deliver OpenDoc and at one point Apple was even going to abandon 
              it. <BR><BR><BR>---- It's bad luck to be superstitious. </P></TD></TR>

      <P>Shame I missed the call for questions: I'm interested in a quirk of ksh 
      and its clones: <BR><BR>Consider this code: <BR><BR>x="hello" <BR>echo 
      "goodbye" | read x <BR>echo $x <BR><BR>In both bash and pdksh, running the 
      script would return "hello", because the "read x" would be run in a 
      subshell with its own environment. The subshell would then close without 
      affecting the instance of x in the main shell. <BR><BR>In ksh, however, 
      putting 'read' at the end of a pipeline does not seem to run it in a 
      subshell, so running the script would return "goodbye" just as the naive 
      reader of the code might expect. <BR><BR>Why is this? Is an exception made 
      for the "read" builtin? Is this a deliberate feature that pdksh and bash 
      have failed to clone, or is it happenstance that it came about? I assume 
      David is too busy to be reading, so does anyone else know? <BR><BR>In our 
      ksh-happy shop, we have a lot of scripts that rely on "echo $string | read 
      x y junk" to parse space-seperated lists, and of course these statements 
      don't port well to Bash (you have to do a few backtick/sed 
      operations).<BR>--<BR>My route 66 active diary is <A

      <P>in the vi vs. Emacs deal. I have to agree. As a sysadmin type I also 
      make the choice based on a couple of other factors. Over a slow SSH 
      connection vi is faster and feels more responsive.The same goes for 
      editing a couple of lines in a config file. But if I have to edit 
      something long or more then a few lines I find Emacs to better suit my 
      style of working (this is somewhat because I learned a evil editor in my 
      youth and did not see how good vi was untill the last year or so.)

      <P>Basically what David Korn says is that all the good shells (or at least 
      popular shells) are similar in terms of interactivity: bash, tcsh, zsh, 
      ksh, and a handfull of others. His selling point is that Ksh has far 
      superior scripting capabilities than the other shells. <BR><BR>As a shell, 
      I personally prefer zsh because the interactivity is a little more 
      customizable than ksh. As a scripting language, I personally prefer Perl 
      because the scripting is more syntactically flexible. (That's a nice way 
      of saying that Perl lets you write both readable code and slash code.) 
      <BR><BR>I won't claim that ksh scripts are inherently messier than a 
      dedicated scripting language. Perhaps I've only seen bad examples of ksh 
      scripts, and I've seen my share of bad perl scripts as well. I will claim, 
      however, that there are other scripting languages which are more 
      expressive than ksh and other shells which are more interactive than ksh. 
      <BR><BR>So I think it's great that ksh scores a 9 out of 10 on 
      interactivity and an 8 out of 10 on scripting, but I can't help but think 
      that Ksh has bridesmaid syndrome-- always second to something else. Sure, 
      you can use your shell to script. You can use your emacs text editor to 
      read news, mail, and play games if you want to. Personally I'd rather have 
      more functionality in each specific area, be it interactivity or 
      scripting. <BR><BR>-Ted<BR>Like the situation at ski resorts of young

      <P><I>Even perl programmers often miss the point, writing the heart and 
      soul of the application as perl script without making use of the UNIX 
      toolkit.</I> 
      <P>I'm not quite sure what to make of his quote above. On one hand, I 
      freely admit that I tend to think in terms of globbing various UNIX 
      commands together to produce some pretty decent results with the use of 
      just a few pipe symbols as glue.
      <P>On the other hand, I feel that doing so in anything intended to be 
      portable and/or robust is just asking for grief. When I stick to utilizing 
      constructs that exist only within perl, I know I'm pretty safe. As soon as 
      I start integrating external commands, I have to worry about checking 
      return values, checking that the command even exists, escaping shell 
      metacharacters, portability issues, and so forth. Some times, it just 
      becomes simpler to "reinvent the wheel", so that I've got a nice, 
      predictable function to deal with.
      <P>That being said, for quick hacks that are't mission critical, external 
      UNIX commands are quite definitely the way to go. However, there often is 
      a valid reason not to go that route.<BR></P></TD></TR>

      <P>I once had the displeasure of working with UWIN in a corporate setting. 
      I had just been transfered to a group that produced a tool consisting of 4 
      posix-compliant C programs multithreaded together using Ksh scripts to 
      glue pieces. No disrespected intended to Ksh itself, the whole code was an 
      utter an complete pile. (As for functionality, the optimal solution 
      involved 1 perl script, no C code or ksh, and it would have taken me a few 
      weeks to do it.) The code took some 2 or 3 years to write, presumably 
      because they used all sorts of great but unnecessary posix features like 
      shared memory maps. Apparently the code really did run fine on a system 
      like Solaris. <BR><BR>Anyway, everyone who worked on the project left the 
      group in 6 months, but the PHB hadn't figured this out. The product was 2 
      years overdue for their Solaris to Windows port. The engineers decided to 
      use UWIN rather than rewrite in Windows because they thought it would be 
      less effort. Those engineers had since left. What we discovered working 
      with with the Global Technologies company supporting UWIN was that UWIN 
      didn't properly support most of the strange features our code used. 
      Roughly 95% of the problems were due to Posix incompatabilities in UWIN. I 
      would routinely spend 2 weeks talking with Global Technologies pointing

      <P>I understand what he is talking about in terms of building new tools 
      based on resuable 'toolkits' of shell commands, but I think Korn's ideas 
      on code resuability are incredibility out of date. <BR><BR>The tools he 
      talks about operate on text streams which are piped from tool to tool. 
      There is no structure to the text streams and it is up to every tool to 
      figure out what the stream contains on it's own. Is it HTML? A Text file? 
      /etc/passwd? To top it off, each tools has it's own arcane syntax and 
      combinations of command line switches - a support, training and 
      maintenance nightmare. <BR><BR>This just does not strike me as a 
      particularly good way of doing things. It was an excellent solution to the 
      problem of resuability back in the days when hardware was slow and memory 
      was limited. But today we have better solutions, and the only reason I 
      could see to use these older tools is for the sake of backward 
      compatibility. <BR><BR>The idea of building a web site using shell scripts 
      strikes me as patently absurd. Sure it can be done, but why, when there 
      are much better tools for the job - and all of these tools have solved 
      many of the code reuse problems of the past in a much more elegant fashion 
      than the Unix 'toolkit' has. <BR><BR>His comments on modern GUIs show a 
      certain naivité about the state of the art of GUI design. Both KDE and 
      Gnome have an extensive object models, and their own component and 
      application toolkits which support code reuse and the building of your own 
      personal 'toolkits'. His critique of GUIs might more appropriately be 
      levelled at older Motif applications, where every app truly is an island 
      unto itself. <BR><BR>It just seems that Korn is living a few decades 
      behind the times. He deserves respect, but his ideas are anachronistic at 
      best. <BR><BR>-josh<BR></P></TD></TR>

      <P>really, this isn't all that much of a flamebait. I see this as a harsh 
      criticism, meant to be both inspiring and informative. although, I'm not 
      sure what was going on when the part about the corn was written. perhaps I 
      was distracted at the time? who cares - the point stands - either troll 
      with flair or fuck off.
