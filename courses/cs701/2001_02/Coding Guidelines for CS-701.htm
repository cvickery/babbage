<h1 align=center>Coding Guidelines</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This document gives the rules you are to follow for all the programs
you write for CS-701. The basic rule is that your code must be written
so that it is correct, robust, efficient, and easy to understand. Most
of the detailed specifications given here apply to the "easy to
understand" criterion because code that is easy to understand is also
most likely to be correct, robust, and efficient too!

<h2>Correctness, Robustness, Efficiency</h2>

A <i>correct program</i> is one that does what it is supposed to do
when all inputs take on values anywhere within their expected range.
Be sure to test your programs for correctness before submitting them.
Pay special attention to situations on the edge of the expected range
of values.  For example, if your program has to read lines of text from
a file, it should not have a problem dealing with empty lines.

<p>A <i>robust program</i> is one that behaves in a "reasonable manner"
when it encounters input values that are not within their expected
range or if expected parameters are missing. The reasonable thing to
do, depending on the severity of the error and the nature of the
program, is to issue an error message and continue processing
(recovery) or to issue an error message and terminate (abort).  Be sure
to test your program's behavior in response to "bad input" before
submitting it too.  Instead of "garbage in, garbage out" your code
should operate on the "garbage in, explanation out" principle.
Explanations should be meaningful, but terse.

<p>An <i>efficient program</i> is one that performs only those
computations necessary to accomplish the work at hand. Aside from the
obvious advantage of executing quickly, efficient code is typically
much easier for someone else to read and understand than code which
performs extraneous operations, which the reader has to understand in
order to know that they can safely be ignored!

<h2>Project Management</h2>

Set up a separate project directory for each assignment, and put only
the files that actually are part of that assignment in the project
directory.  For assignments that are continuations of previous
assignments, reuse the same project directory.

<p>Create a subdirectory named RCS (must be all capital letters) in the
project directory.  You will practice using <i>rcs</i> to keep track of
program versions in this course.

<p>Once you have learned how to use <i>rcs</i> and <i>make</i> (or
<i>gmake</i> as the case may be), you will be required to make the
project directory "clean" so it contains nothing but the RCS
subdirectory and possibly a text file named README (spelled and
capitalized just like that) before submitting an assignment.

<p>To submit an assignment, make the project directory "clean," change
to the directory <i>above</i> the project directory, and create a tar
file of the project directory using a command like the following:

<pre>
    tar cvf Assignment_1.tar Assignment_1
</pre>

This example assumes the project directory name is Assignment_1.  After
you create the tar file, submit it to me as an attachment to an email
message.  <i>Warning!</i> Tar files are "binary" (not text) files, and
will be corrupted if you are not careful when you copy them from one
computer to another.  If you use <i>ftp</i> to transfer a tar file, for
example, you have to be sure to use "binary mode" for the file
transfer. To be sure your tar file is in good shape, you should email a
copy to yourself using exactly the same technique you will use to send
it to me. Then create a temporary directory <u>separate from your
project directory</u>, save the tar file there, and be sure you can
extract the contents of the received copy successfully using a command
like the following:

<pre>
    tar xvf Assignment_1.tar
</pre>

<h2>Programming Language</h2>

<p>All code for this course is to be written in C++ and compiled using
the GNU <i>g++</i> compiler.

<p><center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="80%">
  <tr>

    <th align=left>All code must compile and link with no warnings and
    no errors when compiled with <i>g++</i> using the
    <p><center>
      <code>-g&nbsp;&nbsp;-Wwrite-strings&nbsp;&nbsp;-Wall</code>
    </center><br>command line options.

</table></center>

<p>Because you are programming in C++ you must supply a function
prototype for every function you define except <i>main()</i>. (The C
language does not require prototypes, but C++ does.)

<p>Your function prototype must be in a header file if and only if the
function is defined in one source module and referenced from another
module.  If the function is referenced only from within the same module
in which it is defined and if the definition precedes all references
to the function, the definition itself may be used as the prototype.

<p>You may use most, but not all, of the features of the C++ lanugage
in your code. Parts of the language not to use include:
<ul>

  <li>Do not use I/O Streams, including cin and cout.  Use the standard
  C I/O library instead (<i>printf()</i>, <i>fgets()</i>, etc.) or,
  when an assignment makes it explicit that you should do so, use Unix
  system calls (<i>write()</i>, <i>read()</i>, etc.).  This means you
  will use the header files <code>stdio.h</code>,
  <code>stdlib.h</code>, and <code>unistd.h</code> rather than
  <code>iostream.h</code>.

  <li>Do not use <i>new</i> and <i>delete</i> for dynamic memory
  management.  Use <i>malloc()</i>, <i>realloc()</i>, and <i>free()</i>
  instead.

  <li>In general, do not define classes and do not use the C++ standard
  template library. The vast majority of the code written for this
  course is <i>not</i> object-oriented by nature.  However, there will
  be some simple data structures used in the assignments (lists and
  tables) where it would be entirely appropriate to encapsulate the
  structure and its programming interface into a class, and you are
  encouraged to do so.  If you do define any classes, of course, you
  will have to use <i>new</i> and <i>delete</i> to manage the memory
  for the objects, despite the previous item in this list.  Just be
  careful not to try to <i>free()</i> memory that was allocated with
  <i>new</i> nor to <i>delete</i> memory that was allocated with
  <i>malloc()</i>.

</ul>

<h2>Source File Structure</h2>

<p>All source modules (<code>.cc</code> files and <code>.h</code> files) must
contain the following sections in the order listed here:

<h3>File Introduction</h3>

The file must begin with a block of comments that introduce the file,
called the <b>File Introduction</b>. The first line of the file
introduction must contain the RCS keyword, <code>$Id$</code>, which
will be expanded by RCS to give the file's name, date of modification,
and some other information. Be sure to punctuate and capitalize the
keyword exactly as shown, or RCS won't recognize it. Using the RCS
utility for project management will be covered in class.

<p>The File Introduction then continues with comments that give a
<u>Summary</u> of the file's contents.

<p>If there is more than one function definition in the file, follow
the file summary with a <u>Functions</u> section, which is a list of
the names of all the functions defined in the file, along with a brief
phrase identifying each. Each item in this list should normally fit on
a single line. The list must be in the same order as the sequence of
function definitions in the file.  Do not list functions referenced
from within the file, only functions defined in the file.

<p>The <u>Revision History</u> for the file is the section of the file
introduction in which you list the changes made to the file and the
dates the changes were made. For this course, the revision history
includes only those changes that were made to complete one "step" of
an assignment. Since most code you submit will consist of only a
single step, the revision history will typically say only something
like "Original Version." When an assignment specifically requires you
to do a project as a sequence of steps, the revision history will
document the changes made (if any) for each step of the assignment.
Generate the revision history automatically by putting the RCS keyword
<code>$Log$</code> inside the File Introduction.

<p>Include the Author's Name in the <u>Author</u> section of the File
Introduction. When more than one programmer works on a file, the
authors' names go in the revision history. For this course, only one
person works on a file, so the author's name goes in its own section.
If I give you some code to use as basis for part of a project, put
your name underneath mine with a comment to the  effect that you
modified the code. (Don't put in my name unless I provided a significant
part of the code.  Sample code given in class, for example, is not
"significant.")

<p>Each of the File Introduction sections ("Summary," "Function Names,"
"Revision History," and "Author") should be preceded its own
sub-heading name, but you may omit these names if you think it makes
your code easier to read.

<p>Here is a template you can use for your File Introductions:

<p><pre>
     /*  $Id$
      *
      *  Summary
      *
      *  Function Names
      *
      *  Revision History
      *
      *    $Log$
      *
      *  Author
      *
      */
</pre>

<p>All <code>Makefile</code>s and <i>man</i> page files must also have
a file header with comments giving the $Id$, Summary, Revision
History, and Author sections.

<h3>Include Files, Manifest Constants, and Macro Definitions</h3>

All <code>#include</code> and <code>#define</code> statements follow
the File Introduction section. Put <code>#define</code> statements that
are used in multiple source modules into a header file. Although ANSI
C does not require it, putting a header file name in angle brackets
(<code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>) conventionally means the
header file is one that is supplied with the compiler or part of a
standard programming package that is installed on the development
system. Putting the name of the header file in quotes (<code>"</code>)
conventionally means that the header file is specific to the current
project and is located in the project directory.

<h3>Function Definitions</h3>

Every function definition (including <i>main()</i>&nbsp;!!!) begins
with a <b>Function Introduction</b>, followed by the function
definition itself.

<h4>Function Introduction</h4>

A function introduction is a block of comments that contains the
following information in the order listed here: <p>

<blockquote>
<dl>

  <dt><i>Name</i> <dd>The name of the function.

  <dt><i>Summary</i> <dd>A statement of the purpose of the function.
  Use one or more complete sentences. Write in the present tense.

  <dt><i>Arguments</i> <dd>List the arguments to be passed to the
  function using the names used in the function definition. Give a
  phrase telling what each is used for and any assumptions made about
  the valid range of values the argument may meaningfully take. If any
  arguments are pointers to values that are modified by the function,
  say so.

  <dt><i>Return Value</i> <dd>Tell what values are returned by
  the function. If no value is returned, say so.

  <dt><i>Global Variables</i> <dd>List any global variables that are
  referenced or modified by the function.

  <dt><i>Algorithm</i> <dd>List the steps the function executes. Use
  imperative sentences.

  </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is a template you could use for Function Introductions.  As
with the File Introduction, the heading names are recommended, but not
required.

<pre>
  /*  functionName()
   *  ------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   *  Summary
   *
   *  Arguments
   *
   *  Return Value
   *
   *  Global Variables Referenced
   *
   *  Global Variables Modified
   *
   *  Algorithm
   *
   *    1.
   *
   */
</pre>

<h4>Writing Function Definitions</h4>

Use ANSI function declarations such as
<pre>
    void foo(int x) { ... }
</pre>
instead of "traditional C" definitions such as
<pre>
    foo(x) int x; { ... }
</pre>

<p>Use meaningful variable names. (However, "anonymous" variable names
like <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, and <code>k</code> are OK for
integers used to index arrays.) In general, you do not need to comment
your variable declarations.  Use a consistent style of capitalization
and underscores for variable names.  Manifest constants (set up using
<code>#define</code>) are normally all capitals.  Variable and function
names should be mixed upper/lower case, with underscores or internal
capitals to separate words inside a name.  (num_commands or
numCommands, for example.)  Data types that you define using
<code>struct</code>, <code>enum</code>, or <code>typedef</code>
conventionally have names that end in "_t." (<code>struct node_t { ...
};</code> for example)

<p>Use a consistent indentation style that shows the lexical structure
of your code. Blank lines and other whitespace generally improve your
code's legibility.  Choose an indent increment of either 2, or 4
spaces. Anything larger will result in lines of code that get pushed
over to the right margin and are hard to read.

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="80%">
  <tr>
    <th>No code or comment line may be more than 72 characters long.
</table></center>

Remember the following feature of the language when breaking up
long pieces of code so they will meet this requirement:

<pre>
    printf( "This is a very long line of text that I want to print\n" );
</pre>
can be rewritten as:
<pre>
    printf( "This is a very long "
            "line of text that I "
            "want to print\n" );
</pre>

<p>The only comments you have to write in your function definitions are
ones that correspond exactly to the steps you listed in the Algorithm
section of the Function Introduction. These comments go on lines by
themselves just <i>before</i> the code that implements each step of
the algorithm. Of course, you should add other comments if a piece of
code is difficult to understand, but try to write clear code so the
need for these extra comments is minimized.

<p>There are only two acceptable arguments to the <i>exit()</i>
function: <code>EXIT_SUCCESS</code> and <code>EXIT_FAILURE</code>.
These two constants are defined in <code>stdlib.h</code>, along with
the function prototype for <i>exit()</i>. These two constants normally
have the values of 0 and 1 respectively, and it is all right to use
these values explicitly rather than the constant names. But using any
other values makes your code "unconventional" and thus more difficult
for other programmers to understand easily.

<p>Avoid flag variables wherever possible.  If you must have one, give
it a meaningful name, and use type <i>bool</i> rather than <i>int</i>
for it.  Use <u>true</u> and <u>false</u> as boolean literals; they are
part of the language, but other forms, such as <u>TRUE</u> and
<u>FALSE</u> are not defined on all systems.

<h2>Notes About This Style</h2>

<ul>

  <li>This coding style discourages the use of many small functions to
  implement a program, which is intentional. First of all, small
  functions generally are utilities. In general, the standard C
  library provides all the utility functions you need. Be sure you are
  familiar with all the utilities available to you, especially the
  string manipulation functions, before you decide you need your own
  new one. Writing code that re-implements a standard function is very
  distracting to the people who look at your code after you are
  finished with it, and should be avoided. If you do need to write a
  utility function, this coding style encourages you to think about it
  carefully. It is often the case that the same amount of code can
  provide general utility instead of satisfying just a single need,
  which increases the probability that the function can be used in
  other applications. For this reason, utility functions should be in
  separate source modules so they can be incorporated into other
  applications easily.

  <li>Believe it or not (and I know you don't), it really makes more
  sense to write the comments before you write the code than the other
  way around.  Listing the steps of the algorithm performed by a
  function and then creating the sectional comments for each step
  means that writing the code is just a matter of filling in the
  blanks. It is much more effective use of your time to think and then
  write code than its is to "debug a program into existence." On top
  of that, the world is full of programmers who lament, "the program
  stopped working when I added the comments!" Editing a file opens up
  the possibility of inadvertent changes, changes that always seem
  particularly difficult to debug.

  <li>It could be argued that this style discourages program modularity
  by increasing the overhead on the programmer for each new function
  defined.  Actually, good modularity demands that the interfaces to
  each module should be carefully designed and that each module should
  be a self-contained entity as much as possible. The style presented
  here encourages this type of modularity.
