<H1>CS-701 - Spring 2001 - Assignment 3</H1>
</center>

<H2>Due Date and Deliverables</H2>

<center><B>
This assignment is due by midnight, March 22.<p>
</B></center>

Send me an email with a tar file attached to it.  Be sure to
put your name and ID number in the message part of the
email.<P>

The tar file is to contain a project directory named Assignment_3.  The
project directory is to contain one file, named README, and one
subdirectory, named RCS, <u>and nothing else</u>.  The RCS subdirectory
must contain contain history files for a file named Makefile, at least
two .cc files, and one .h file.  After extracting the contents of the
tar file, I should be able to type "(g)make" in the project directory
to build an executable file named <i>qsh</i>, corresponding to Version
1.6 described below.  I should be able to all versions of the project
using suitable <I>rcs</I> commands.<p>

<b>Note: All code you submit for this assignment, and for all
assignments in this course, must compile with no warning or error
messages using the g++ compiler driver with the -Wall option.<p></b>

<H2>Specifications</H2>

The <i>qsh</i> program is a shell which recognizes three commands:
<i>exit</i>, <i>quit</i>, and <i>print</i>, described below.  This
version of the shell is to ignore all other commands, including blank
lines.  The shell is to use the value of the "PS1" environment variable
as its prompt string, if it is defined.  If it is not defined, it is to
use a string of your choice, provided it contains at least one non-blank
character and has a space at the end of it.<p>

        <LI>If there is more than one argument, write an error message

        <I>strtoul()</I>, exit the shell with an exit code equal to the
        numeric value of <I>n</I> modulo 256.
        <LI>If there is a single command line argument, but it is not a
        valid numeric string, write an error message to <I>stderr</I> and
        do not exit the shell. Set the command completion code to 1.

    <TD valign=top>If there are any command line arguments, write an
    error message to <I>stderr</I>,do not exit the shell, and set the

    <TD valign=top>Write all command line arguments, separated from each
    other by a single space, to <I>stdout</I>.  Terminate the output
    with a <I>newline</I>. Set the command completion code to the number
    of command line arguments.

<H3>Coding Requirements</H3>

The program is to consist of a <i>main()</i> function and two functions
named <i>sh_exit()</i> and <i>sh_print()</i>.  The two functions must
be defined in a source module separate from the one that contains
<i>main()</i>.  (You may use two separate modules for <i>sh_exit()</i>
and <i>sh_print()</i> if you prefer.)  The source modules must all
<code>#include</code> a header file that contains function prototypes
for the <i>sh_exit()</i> and <i>sh_print()</i> functions.<P>

There must be a Makefile with appropriately-defined rules for the
targets <I>qsh, clean,</I> and <I>depend</I>.<p>

All source files, including the <I> Makefile</I> and the header file,
must be commented according to the coding guidelines for this course,
including properly coded $Id$ and $Log$ keywords.<p>

You must develop the program using a series of revisions.  What follows
is a list of versions, which must exist in the RCS history for the
project.  However, your revision numbers do not have to match the exact
revision numbers given here.  Instead, your README file is to contain a
table that tells what revision number to use for each file in the
project in order to construct a program with the features indicated
below.

<center><table border=1 cellpadding=5 width="90%">

  <TR>
    <TH>Version Number
    <TH>Requirements
  
  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>1.1    
    <TD>There is one file, named <I>main.cc</I>, <I>qsh.cc</I>, or
    something similarly meaningful.  The program prints the value of the
    environment variable named "PS1" if it is defined.  If PS1 is not
    defined the program either prints nothing, an error message, or a
    default prompt string as described above.  The program then exits.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>1.2
    <TD>The program enters an endless loop in which it prints the
    prompt string and reads a command typed by the user using
    <I>fgets()</I>.  The program doesn't print anything, except the
    prompt string, each time through the loop.  Each prompt string must
    be printed starting in the left margin of the user's window,
    regardless of what the user types on the command line.  You may
    assume the user will never type Control-D.  (What happens if s/he
    does?) The user exits the program by typing Control-C.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>1.3
    <TD>Break each command line into whitespace-separated tokens using
    the <I>strtok()</I> or <I>strtok_r()</I> library function.  Set up
    a dispatch table as described in class which has just one entry,
    for the command named <I>exit</I>.  Implement this command,
    according to the specifications given above, in a function named
    <I>sh_exit()</I>.  If <I>sh_exit()</I> returns to <I>main()</I>, it
    should return a value of 1 or 2 as described above.  But at this
    point, <I>main()</I> should ignore the returned value.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>1.4
    <TD>Add <I>Makefile</I> to the project, move the definition of
    <I>sh_exit()</I> to a separate source module, and add a header file
    with the function prototype for sh_exit() in it.  Both .cc files
    must #include the same header file.  The Makefile is to contain
    rules for the targets <I>qsh, clean,</I> and <I>depend</I>.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>1.5
    <TD><I>Note: This is not the same as the Version 1.5 originally
    given out in Lecture 8.</I>
    <UL>
      <LI>Implement the builtin <I>print</I> command in a function
      named <I>sh_print()</I>.  Define the function in either the same
      module as <I>sh_exit()</I> or in its own separate module.  Modify
      the header file and Makefile to accommodate this change.
      <LI>Implement the builtin <I>quit</I> command by setting up the
      dispatch table to call <I>sh_exit()</I> for this command. Modify
      <I>sh_exit()</I> so that it differentiates between <I>exit</I> and
      <I>quit</I> commands, as described in the specifications.
    </UL>

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>1.6
    <TD>This version includes a temporary hack, which will be cleaned up
    later in the project.
    <BR>Whenever a command returns to <I>main()</I>, save the return
    value, modulo 256, as a string.  The temporary hack is this: If any
    command line argument is "$?", substitute the string representation
    of the previous command's return value for the argument.  Here is a
    sample interchange that illustrates what this step should do:
    <PRE>
      <B>howdy> </B>exit this program now.
      <I>exit: too many arguments</I>
      <B>howdy> </B>print The previous command's exit code was $?
      <I>The previous command's exit code was 2</I>
      <B>howdy </B>
    </PRE>
