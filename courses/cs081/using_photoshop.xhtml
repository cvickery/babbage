          Photoshop is a program that has literally changed the world, or at least how we see it. In an era when
          virtually all imagery is digital, Photoshop sets the standard for creating and editing the ubiquitous digital
          images that we all encounter every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Photoshop is a huge program that would take &ldquo;forever&rdquo; to master completely. Furthermore, there are
          untold numbers of resources that can help you master the program&rsquo;s features. So many, in fact, that it
          can be difficult to know where to start. This page simply introduces you to some basic techniques that can be
          used to prepare images for use with web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will start with some background material, and then move on to three basic Photoshop techniques that can be
          used in preparing images for the web. When you finish, you might decide that working with digital images is
          not for you, but you will at least have an idea of what the process is like. On the other hand, perhaps this
          will whet your appetite to learn more about working with digital images &hellip;
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          You should already be familiar with <a href="preparing_images.xhtml">Preparing Images For The Web</a>, which
          introduces basic concepts about image file formats and how image files should be optimized for use on
          web pages. While Photoshop is usually thought of as a program for manipulating bit-mapped images, it also uses
          works with vector shapes in many situations. In particular, the third part of this page will deal with text
          manipulations that you will perform in Photoshop&rsquo;s vector domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can use Photoshop to create an image from scratch (&ldquo;starting with a blank canvas&rdquo; to use the
          painting analogy), or you can start with an existing image, typically a photograph, and change the properties
          of the image in various ways. Both techniques are used to produce images for the web. But before dealing with
          techniques, here is an example of how a photographer might use Photoshop to prepare a picture for printing.
          It&rsquo;s not the same situation as preparing images for the web, but gives an idea of how Photoshop works.
        </p>
        <h3>Preparing a picture for printing</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            A photographer takes a picture with either a film or digital camera. If it&rsquo;s film, the image has to be
            converted to a digital image using a scanner. Scanners and cameras typically produce JPEG image files, but
            higher-end digital cameras can produce images in a &ldquo;camera raw&rdquo; format (often written RAW for
            unknown reasons; it is not an acronym). If the image is a JPEG, it has had some color/exposure adjustments
            and compression applied to it by the camera or the scanner. Raw images have no compression or color
            adjustments applied to them, but they come in various file formats, depending on the camera manufacturer.
            Photoshop can work with JPEGs directly, but raw files have to be converted into a format that Photoshop can
            work with using a program called Adobe Camera Raw (ACR) that comes with Photoshop. ACR has a rich set of
            controls for making color and exposure adjustments before passing the image on to Photoshop. (ACR controls
            can do either less or much more extensive image adjustments than what is normally done in a digital camera
            or a scanner; the choice is up to you.  A big advantage of working with raw images is that the ACR
            adjustments are non-destructive: they get added to the raw file as metadata rather than as changes to the
            pixel values recorded by the camera; they can be undone after the fact, if desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a picture is opened by Photoshop, it is converted into an internal format that Photoshop can work with.
            If you edit the image, you can save your changes in any of several image file formats, including JPEG or PSD
            (&ldquo;PhotoShop Document&rdquo; format).  If you start with a JPEG, you can save your changes either in
            the original file that you started with, or in a copy with a different file name.  It is a lot smarter to
            keep the original file unchanged in case you do something in Photoshop that you later decide wasn&rsquo;t
            such a good idea. If you want to preserve any layers you created in Photoshop, you have to save the file as
            a PSD. If you started with a raw file, you cannot save your edits back as a raw file, so you have to save it
            as a PSD file.
          </p>
          <p class="side-note">
            In <a href="preparing_images.xhtml">Preparing Images For The Web</a>, we talked about Photoshop&rsquo;s
            &ldquo;save for web and devices&rdquo; option. When you use that option, (a) you are always saving a
            copy of your work that is separate from the JPEG or PSD file you started with; (b) there are other file
            formats you will pick from for your web copies in addition to JPEG, namely GIF, PNG-8, and PNG-24. (Actually,
            if you pick JPEG for the output from Save For Web &amp; Devices, you could very easily overwrite the image
            you started with if it was a JPEG: be careful!)
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the picture is open in Photoshop, you can manipulate it. In general, you have a choice
              of applying the manipulations on the image itself or on one or more &ldquo;layers&rdquo; that
              conceptually sit in front of the image layer. Once you change the image itself, there is
              much less flexibility for modifying those changes, so it is almost always wiser to create
              a new layer for each manipulation. Photoshop keeps the layers separate in a PSD file, which
              is why that format gives more options for re-editing an image than a JPEG does. If you
              save a file as a JPEG, all the layers first get &ldquo;flattened&rdquo; into a single
            layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Broadly speaking, there are four kinds of modifications a photo editor might do:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <h4>Change Geometry</h4>
              This category refers to things like changing the intrinsic size of the image (cropping or enlarging),
              rotation, flipping, and warping.
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Adjustments</h4>
              The basic adjustments mimic things that are normally done inside a digital camera or using ACR, but with a
              greater amount of control: Levels, Curves, Color Balance, and Brightness/Contrast. Other adjustments allow
              more &ldquo;creative&rdquo; adjustments, such as converting a color image to monochrome, or shifting
              colors in various ways. In addition there are a number of very powerful tools that can be used to retouch
              an image either for creative effects or to make it look &ldquo;better&rdquo; than the image the camera
              captured.  The effects range from enhancement (similar to what a studio photographer might accomplish
              using sophisticated lighting) to creativity (like putting an elephant in a teacup) to outright fraud or
              deception. The boundaries are not always simple to state. (Is it all right to add someone to a group
              picture if they weren&rsquo;t there when the picture was taken? Sometimes yes; sometimes no.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Filters</h4>
              &ldquo;Filters&rdquo; are called that to evoke the optical filters that can be screwed
              onto the lens of a camera to affect the
              image that reaches the film (or sensor). Some traditional filters can change the color
              cast of a picture, others can distort an image in various ways. There are many patterns
              and textures that can be created using filters. An especially important set of filters
              for the digital photographer allow selective sharpening or blurring of parts of the image.
              (Sharpening cannot fix an out of focus image, but it can help make edges stand out better
              in a picture.)
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Layer Styles</h4>
              Layer styles are effects that can be applied to shapes to give them drop shadows, contrasting edges, and
              various other effects that are best understood by experimentation. A photographer might put a white border
              around a photo, and add a drop style to the picture itself, for example:
              <p>
                <img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-2.jpg" alt="white border and drop shadow picture" />
              </p>
              <p>
                Normally, a layer obscures the layers below it, but Photoshop also provides ways to mask out parts of a
                layer, blend layers together using over two dozen &ldquo;blend modes&rdquo;, and to control the opacity of
                layers.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            Once the picture is ready for printing, the photographer would then use Photoshop to make sure the
            image&rsquo;s color profile matches the ink/paper combination being used for printing, lay out the picture
            on the page, and send the image to the printer.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          There are two important observations to make about the foregoing description:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            There are often many ways to accomplish a given effect. Sometimes this redundancy is provided so that users
            with different backgrounds will have familiar tools to work with. The dodge and burn tools and the
            photographic filters, for example, mimic the tools of the trade familiar to film photographers but not to
            someone who never used them in the past. Other times, a feature designed to do one thing can be pushed into
            doing something else by managing its settings in an unusual way. If you learn a technique for doing
            something, use it. But be open to discovering another way to do the same thing easier or better in the
            future.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layers are important. They are not intuitive to everyone, but you cannot avoid them entirely, and they add a
            great deal of flexibility to working with the program.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          One more thing to recognize is that a lot of professionals work with Photoshop on a full-time
            basis, and there are lots of features in the program designed to make these people&rsquo;s
            lives easier. There are ways to control how things are laid out on the screen, to setup keyboard
            shortcuts to reduce time spent with the mouse (or stylus; real pros use Wacom tablets), and
            to automate repetitive operations. One secret to learning Photoshop is to ignore the parts
            you don&rsquo;t need.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="gradients">Gradients</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The first effect we are going to work on can be used to overcome some of the flat look that is the limit of
          what CSS can provide. Using gradients, colors and shapes can blend into each other, buttons can be made to
          look shiny, and parts of a page can be designed to create a sense of movement.
        </p>
        <p id="gradient-paragraph">
          We will go over the process of creating the gradient image that is used for the background of this paragraph. Admittedly,
          this paragraph doesn&rsquo;t look shiny or three dimensional, but it does show a gradation in color that can&rsquo;t be
          achieved using CSS alone. To start, here is the CSS rule that was applied to this paragraph:
        </p>
        <p class="code-block">
#gradient-paragraph {
  padding:1em;
  background:<span id="bgcolor-span">#ffc</span> url(../images/lightRedGradient.png) top left repeat-y;
}       </p>
        <p>
          The first thing to note is that the background color of the paragraph is different from the background of the rest of
          this section.
          <span class="javascript-needed">
            You can click on these buttons to change that background color without changing
            the background image:
            <button id="red-button"><img src="images/background-button_red.png" alt="red" /></button>
            <button id="green-button"><img src="images/background-button_green.png" alt="green" /></button>
            <button id="blue-button"><img src="images/background-button_blue.png" alt="blue" /></button>
            <button id="cream-button"><img src="images/background-button_cream.png" alt="cream" /></button>
          </span>
          <span class="javascript-not-available">
            (If you enable JavaScript for this page, you can experiment with changing the background color of the paragraph
            without changing the background image.)
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The point of this demonstration is to show that the background image fades from a red color on the left to
          <em>transparency</em> on the right: if you change the background color, it shows through on the right side of
          the heading, but not on the left side. It also shows the concept of CSS box <em>layers</em>: the
          background color is behind the background image, which is behind the content. (If you do not specify a
          background color, it is transparent, and the background color of the element that contains the box shows through.)
          CSS box layers are not the same as Photoshop layers, but in both cases the effect is that a layer that is in front
          of other layers obscures the ones behind it. (Or in Photoshop terms, a layer above other layers obscures the ones below
          it.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Other things to note about the CSS rule for the example are that the image is positioned at
            the top left of the heading (that is, the top left corner of the image is placed at the top
            left corner of the background box), and that the image repeats in the Y (vertical) direction.
            The CSS repeat-y value is often spoken of as &ldquo;vertical tiling.&rdquo;
        </p>

        <h3>Decide on the image&rsquo;s intrinsic size</h3>
        <p>
          Before you start, you need to decide how large to make your background image. This is actually
            a complicated issue because you have to specify the intrinsic size of the image in pixels,
            but the size of the CSS box that you used it on depends on many factors: amount of text that
            goes in the box; font size and weight of the text; intrinsic sizes of any foreground images
            inside the box; padding and borders for the box; and explicit CSS settings for the width
            and  height of the box. But really,
          since we are going to design an image that is tiled vertically as many times as necessary,
            it is only the horizontal size of the image that matters. But even that simplification yields
            no easy answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          To add to the complexity, the width of the CSS box may also depend on the pixel dimensions of the viewer&rsquo;s screen.
          Desktops and laptops have screen widths ranging from 768 to close to 2,000 pixels these days&mdash;but even with those
          numbers, there is no way to know how much of the screen a user will actually use for the browser window at a given time.
          At the other extreme, if your visitor is viewing the application on an iPhone, you know the browser will fill the
          480&times;320 pixel screen&mdash;but you don&rsquo;t know whether it will be held horizontally or vertically.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are three basic ways to deal with this problem:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Control the width of the containing box explicitly using the <span class="property-name">width</span>,
            <span class="property-name">min-width</span>, and/or <span class="property-name">max-width</span> CSS
            properties.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use separate stylesheets for different categories of viewing devices. The <span class="tag-name">style</span> element
            has a <span class="attribute-name">media</span> attribute that can be set to <span class="attribute-value">"screen"</span>
            or <span class="attribute-value">"mobile"</span>. Using these attributes, you can have different style sheets for
            different viewing situations, with the the size of the background images adjusted for them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a best guess, and adjust the results. (I don&rsquo;t think you would hear this in a graphic arts course.) This is the
            approach we will use: pick a width and see how it works. We can always go back and generate another image.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There is one last issue here: when tiling vertically, the image can be as little as one pixel high. This height would
          minimize the size of the image file, but there are two possible negatives: one is that the browser has to make more copies
          of a small image than a larger one in order to cover the background; the other is that it can be hard to see what you are
          doing on such a small image. We will make our image 20 pixels high so we can see what we are doing. Then we can reduce the
          file size by reducing the height as an optimization later if we want to.
        </p>
        <h3>Start Photoshop and get oriented</h3>
        <p>
          Start up Photoshop. In the lab, it&rsquo;s Start&mdash;&gt;Programs&mdash;&gt;Adobe Web Premium
          CS3&mdash;&gt;Adobe Photoshop CS3.  The workspace will look different if you are using a different version
          from CS3, but what follows is pretty much independent of the version.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a vertical toolbar on the left, a set of panels and sub-panels on the right (also called
          &ldquo;palettes&rdquo;, a horizontal toolbar at the top, and a menu bar across the very top. An important item
          in the menu bar is the Window menu, which is used to select palettes to show if they are not currently visible.
          The horizontal toolbar at the top changes, depending on which tool you have selected from the vertical toolbar
          on the left.
        </p>
        <p class="side-note">
        	The Photoshop user interface is intimidating because there are so many features and tools in the program. On top of that
          (actually, because of that), it is designed to be reorganized, rearranged, and customized to suit whatever task is at hand.
          Don&rsquo;t worry about messing it up: Window&mdash;&gt;Workspace brings up a set of options for resetting the workspace,
          palettes, and menus to their its default setups, so you can always get back to &ldquo;normal&rdquo; if things get out of hand.
        </p>
        <h3>Create a new image with a transparent background</h3>
        <p>
        	Use File&mdash;&gt;New to create a new image file. A panel comes up, and you could just click OK to accept all the default
          settings that show up: everything there can be changed while you are working on the image. But it is easier to set things up
          here.
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>
          	Change &ldquo;Untitled-1&rdquo; to a meaningful name for your image. We will use &ldquo;600x20_red_gradient&rdquo; for
            this exercise.

          <li>

            use a resolution of 72 to 90 for images destined for the web.
          </li>
          <li>

          	Leave the Background Contents &ldquo;White.&rdquo; Our image will actually have a transparent background, but it is
            convenient to have a white background layer while working on it so we can see what we are doing better.
          </li>
          <li>
          	Open up the Adavanced options and be sure the Color Profile is set to sRGB. Don&rsquo;t worry about the other stuff
            in the color profile name; there is only one sRGB. The Pixel Aspect Ratio should be Square Pixels for web images.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        	A new window will come up showing your image. You can magnify or shrink it using Control_+ and Control_- to get it to
          a size you are comforatable working with.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Create a new layer (Layer&mdash;&gt;New&mdash;&gt;Layer&nbsp;&hellip;. A panel will come up, the only setting you need to
          check is that the color is &ldquo;None;&rdquo; this will be the transparent background for the actual image. Find the
          Layers palette on the right side. It should now look like this:
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-3.png" alt="screenshot of layers palette" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	The blue bar shows that Layer 1 (the one you just created) is &ldquo;active.&rdquo; Whatever you do now will affect that
          layer. The padlock on Layer 0 says it is locked and cannot be edited.
          The eyeball on the left of each layer shows that it is &ldquo;visible.&rdquo; You can click it to turn it on or off. Click
          on the Background eyeball
          to turn it off, and you will see that your image now has a gray and white checkerboard appearance, indicating that the
          only visible layer (Layer 1) is transparent and cannot be seen. (There may be a deep metaphysical truth involving visible
          layers that cannot be seen, but you will have to take that up someplace else&mdash;we have a gradient to build.)
        </p>
        <p>
        	The gradient tool is in the middle of the vertical toolbar. It shares its position with the paint bucket tool, so if you
          see that instead, click and hold it for a few seconds and it will reveal the gradient tool option, which you can select.
          This screenshot shows the tool opened up to show both options. The &lsquo;G&rsquo; is the keyboard shortcut you can use to select
          the tool; repeating it will toggle tools:
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-4.png" width="207" height="67" alt="screenshot of gradient/paint bucket tools" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	With the gradient tool selected, the horizontal toolbar at the top lets you configure the gradient(s) you are going to draw.
          The second tool in that bar has a downward&ndash;pointing arrow on the right that opens up set of predefined gradient types
          that you can select from. You want the second one, which goes from black to transparent, the one pointed to by the red arrow
          in this screenshot:
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-5.png" alt="selecting the type of gradient" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	If you let your mouse hover over the place that the red arrow is pointing, you will get a tooltip that shows you the name of
          this gradient, &ldquo;Foreground to transparent.&rdquo; Before drawing the gradient, you need to set Photoshop&rsquo;s
          foreground color. By default, Photoshop uses black and white as its foreground and background colors. These get changed all
          the time. (&lsquo;D&rsquo; changes them back to the default values of black and white; &lsquo;X&rsquo; exchanges which is
          foregound and which is background.) One (of many) easy ways to set the foreground color is to click on the black square in
          the foreground/background tool towards the bottom of the vertical toolbar. This will bring up an elaborate color picker
          panel where you can select the new foreground color in many different ways. Use it to select a light red color (or other
          color of your liking), and you are ready to draw your gradient. Notice that the sample gradient in the horizontal toolbar
          changes to indicate the new foreground color.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Be sure Layer 1 is active, and drag a horizontal line across your image. You can hold the shift key to keep the line straight.
          Because the background layer is white, the image should go from red to white from left to right. Type Control_Shift_Z to undo
          your gradient, and draw another one from right to left. Undo that and draw one from top to bottom; at an angle; starting in
          the middle. Drag out the sides of window that holds the image so there is some gray space around the outside of it, and draw the
          gradient starting outside the image. Try drawing two gradients on the image at the same time. Try changing your foreground
          color and drawing another gradient. In a word: experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Note that the gradient can have different shapes: experiment with radial and reflected gradients using the buttons to the right
          of the gradient type selector. Also, note that you can reverse the direction of the gradient and whether or not transparency
          works using the checkboxes further to the right of that. (To see how reflected works, start in the center of your image and
          drag towards either the left or right edge.)
        </p>
        <p class="side-note">
        	This is strictly optional at this point, but you should know about it: If you double-click on the gradient type (second tool
          from the left on the horizontal toolbar), you will open up an elaborate panel for creating your own gradient style. In the middle
          of the panel is the control for setting up the gradient. On the top, there is a &ldquo;stop&rdquo; at both ends for controlling
          the opacity of the gradient at those ends; you can click on one to select it, and change the opacity at that end by entering a
          value in the lower part of the panel. You can also drag a stop to change its position, and you can create new stops simply by
          clicking anywhere along the top of the gradient where there is not a stop already. Then, to make things interesting, there is
          another pair of stops at the bottom for setting the color at various points along the length of the gradient. The preset gradients
          are shown at the top of the panel; clicking on one will show how the stops were set up to create it. In a word: play.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Back to work: Create linear gradient that starts with a red color on the left and fades to transparent on the right. End the
          gradient before getting to the right end of the image file; this will prevent a line break from appearing when the image
          does not cover the complete width of the CSS box for which it serves as a background.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Save your work. Since you have two layers, you should save the file as a PSD file to preserve all the information available.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Be sure Layer 1 is visible and the Background layer is invisible so your image is transparent on the right side.
        	Use File&mdash;&gt;Save&nbsp;Web&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Devices to bring up the panel where you will optimize your image for use
          on the web. This is a big panel that lets you try out different file formats to see what gives you the effect you want in
          the smallest size possible. There are tabs at the top for &ldquo;Original,&rdquo; &ldquo;Optimized,&rdquo; &ldquo;2-Up,&rdquo;
          and &ldquo;4-Up.&rdquo; Select 4-Up, which will let you look at the original image you created and three alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>
        	By default, the three alternatives may or may not be useful. Photoshop will bring up the last file format you used in all three
          alternatives. But the first time you do this, you might get three different types of GIF files. GIG is unsuitable for this
          exercise because it allows only one level of transparency, and we need a gradual transition from opaque to transparent. (JPEG
          allows no transparency, so that format will not work either.) So select one of the alternatives (click on it and a blue border
          will appear around it), and change the drop-down menu on the right that says GIF to PNG-8. Click on another alternative, and
          change its format to PNG-24.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Feel free to experiment, but I think you will find that only the PNG-24 image format will give the smooth gradation to
          transparency that we are looking for. Both GIF and PNG use color look-up tables with just a single entry reserved for
          pure transparency. PNG-8 allows you to simulate degrees of transparency by &ldquo;dithering&rdquo; transparent pixels
          among solid color pixels, but GIF does not even offer this option, at least not in Photoshop.
        </p>
        <p class="side-note">
        	Truth in advertising: Photoshop is not the best tool for producing this image file. Fireworks, another program in Adobe&rsquo;s
          &ldquo;Creative Suite&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s what the &ldquo;CS&rdquo; in &ldquo;CS3&rdquo; stands for), was able to
          generate the equivalent gradient in a PNG file that was only 7% of the size of the one generated by Photoshop! Fireworks uses
          the PNG format as its native file format, so the following screenshot shows the sizes of the PSD file, the equivalent Fireworks
          PNG file, and the two PNG files optimized for the web. Not only is the Fireworks web image much smaller, but it the master
          file stores the gradient as vector data, which means you can go back to the original gradient and change its shape, position,
          stops, etc. Photoshop stores the gradient as a pixel matrix, so the only way to make changes is to erase the pixels and
          start over. But this is a Photoshop lesson, not a Fireworks lesson, so we will overlook this nasty little fact.
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-6.png" alt="file sizes of the gradient files" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	Save the PNG file in your web site&rsquo;s images directory, add a CSS rule like the one shown previously to your web page.
          Be sure the name of the image file matches the file name in the CSS rule, of course.
          Congratulations! Now you can apply background gradients to any CSS box on your web pages.

      <h2 id="picture-tiles">Picture Tiles</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          There are two techniques that are often used to used pictures as backgrounds for elements like headings, where the element is
          likely to be much wider than it is tall. One is to use a big picture and present just a horizontal slice of it, and the other
          is to tile a picture horizontally. The latter technique is the focus of this section, but first, here is a digression on how
          to crop images, the technique used for the former technique.
        </p>
        <h3>Cropping (a digression)</h3>
        <p>        	          
          Our cropping example is to start with this rather uninteresting snapshot &hellip;

        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-7.jpg" alt="uninteresting snapshot" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	&hellip; and to transform it into this striking design element:
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-8.jpg" alt="striking design element" class="wide-image" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	Admittedly, real graphics designers would undoubtedly question whether this particular example represents a &ldquo;striking design
          element&rdquo;. (Or might cite it as a strking example of poor design.) But if you look around, you will see
          examples of this sort of thing on many web sites and in print. (Pictures of people&rsquo;s eyes are popular.)
        </p>
        <p>
        	The above two examples were created as follows: First make a copy of the original picture file so you don&rsquo;t accidentally
          destroy it using Photoshop. Now, instead of starting a new Photoshop document, use File&mdash;&gt;Open to open the copy of the
          JPEG image. This one was a 10 megapixel file produced by the camera in the picture. Use Image&mdash;&gt;Image&nbsp;Size&hellip; to
          bring up the panel for resizing images, and enter either the height or width of the image as you want it to appear on the web page, be sure
          the &ldquo;Constrain Proportions&rdquo; option is selected, and choose &ldquo;Bicubic Sharper (best for reductions)&rdquo; for the
          resampling algorithm. This reduces the image file size considerably, and prepares it for exporting using
          File&mdash;&gt;Save&nbsp;Web&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Devices. For photographs, the format for the web will probably be JPEG, and a low
          image quality (such as 30) will probably suffice. But you could experiment with PNG-24 to see if you could get a smaller image
          file. This process is for the first picture. 
        </p>
        <p>
        	For the horizontal picture, open another copy of the original picture (so you have the full 10 megapixels to work with), and crop
          the image to the shape you want, and then resize it to the intrinsic resolution you want, and use
          File&mdash;&gt;Save&nbsp;Web&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Devices to export it for the web.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Like so many features of Photoshop, there is more than one way to crop an image. There is a crop tool on the vertical toolbar you can
          use: <img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-9.png" alt="crop tool icon" />. But while the crop tool is the obvious choice for cropping an
          image, it offers lots of options that can make it tricky to use. A simple technique for cutting out a piece of a picture (keeping the
          pixels that you cut out unchanged) is to use the rectangular marquee toool, <img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-10.png" 
          alt="rectangular marquee tool icon" /> to make a selection of the part of the image you want, and then to use the
          Image&mdash;&gt;Crop menu item to make the crop.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Making a picture tile-able</h3>
        <p>
        	If you want to repeat a picture horizontally, you have to decide how to handle the seams between the copies of the picture. For example,
          you could transform this repeating image:
        </p>
        <div id="repeat-x-before">
				</div>
        <p>Into this:</p>
        <div id="repeat-x-after">
				</div>
				<p>
        	The idea is to get the left and right edges to blend together, and the trick is first to put these two edges next to each other in
          the Photoshop window. To do this, make a copy of the picture you want to work with, open it, and use the 
          Filter&mdash;&gt;Other&mdash;&gt;Offset&hellip; menu to bring up a panel that will let you offset the outside edges so they are in the
          middle of the image window. (You can also offset the top and bottom edges here if you were going to tile the image vertically.) 
        </p>
        <p>
        	<img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-13.jpg" alt="image with outside edges offset to the middle" />
        </p>
        <p>
        	Fixing the image so there is no seam in the middle requires some practice with Photoshop&rsquo;s retouching tools. The less the
          difference to start with, the easier it is to do a passable job. One tool to work with is the patch tool: 
          <img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-14.png" alt="patch tool icon" />. This tool shares a position with several others on the
          vertical toolbar; if you don&rsquo;t see it, the easiest way to find it is to type its keyboard shortcut, &lsquo;J&rsquo;, a
          few times until it shows up. Be sure the options in the top toolbar are &ldquo;Source&rdquo; and not &ldquo;Transparent.&rdquo;
          Virtually no image can be fixed in one step: you have to do it bit by bit. With the patch tool selected, drag out a shape
          (&ldquo;selection&rdquo;) around a piece of the edge you want to fix. When you have surrounded it, let go of the mouse, and
          you can then drag your selection to another part of the image; let go of the mouse, and Photoshop will blend the second piece of
          the image over the first piece. Repeat this process until the center seam is not obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The screenshot below shows the process at the point when a piece of the seam has been selected and dragged to the left.
          When you try it, you will see that
          the edges of the patched area will be blended with the area surrounding the patch; you may need to patch the edges of the patch
          to get a smooth blend all around.
        </p>
        <p>
        <img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-15.png" alt="patch tool in action" />
        </p>

      </div>
      <h2 id="text-headings">Text Headings</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
        	People care a lot about fonts, the shapes of the letters that we see in print and on the screen. A font file tells how to render
          (draw) images of characters, and you have to have a font file installed in your computer in order to use that font. We aquire font
          files in a number of ways: some come with the operating system (but Windows, Macintosh, and Linux generally come with different
          sets of font files); some come with application programs, like Microsoft Office or Adobe Photoshop; others are available for free
          on the internet; still others are available only for people who pay for them. It would be nice if we could pick the fonts to use
          on our web pages and count on all our viewers to be able to see our web pages as we designed them. But to do that would mean
          supplying each viewer with a copy of each font file used by our web pages which is neither practical or, often, even legal at the
          present time.
        </p>
        <p>
        	In this section we will see how to use any font that is available on your own computer to generate an image file containing text
          that you can display on a web page using an <span class="tag-name">img</span> element. The problems with this approach are that
          users may have images disabled and that the use of image files for textual content makes updating either the content or appearance
          of the text an elaborate process involving another trip through Photoshop.
        </p>
        <p>
        	For this exercise, open Photoshop and create a new image file. Make the size of the image larger than you think you will need to
          hold the text; you can trim it to size later. The text you add to the file will go on a layer with a transparent background, so start
          with a white background layer that will let you see what you are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Once you select the text tool from the vertical toolbar (the tool with a T for an icon), you can simply click in the image and
          start typing. There are four different type tools, so be sure you have selected the Horizontal Type Tool. The horizontal options
          bar at the top will let you select your text&rsquo;s properties before you type, or you can type in your text, then select it and
          change the properties afterwards.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Each text layer keeps the text information as vectors, which means that you can change the text properties (font, weight, color,
          size, alignment) and even the contents without worrying about pixelation. For example, if you create some type using a size of 52 points,
          you can double the height and width of the image, and the text will automatically scale up to 104 points while retaining crisp edges.
          You can&rsquo;t do that with bitmapped images, like photographs. But once you &ldquo;rasterize&rdquo; a text layer, you can no longer
          edit it. (Photoshop will warn you if you try to do something that requires rasterizing a text layer.)
        </p>
        <p>
        	Once you have created your text, you can turn off the background layer and save the image as a PNG file with transparency so that the
          background of the element shows through:
        </p>
        <h2 class="image-text"><img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-16.png" alt="This is some text" /></h2>
        <p>
        	Note that it is critical that you set the alt text of the <span class="tag-name">img</span> file to be the same as the text in the
          image. Otherwise, someone with images disabled or otherwise invisible would not know what the text says.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Finally, you can use Phototshop&rsquo;s &ldquo;Layer styles&rdquo; to add interesting effects to the text, such as an outline,
          a drop shadow, or an inner &ldquo;glow&rdquo;, all of which are configurable in a number of ways. (Experiment/Play!). To add layer
          styles to a text layer, select it and then click on the "fx" icon at the bottom of the layer panel. Here is the above text and background
          after adding a drop shadow, a 2 pixel orange &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; (outline), and a 4 pixel red inner glow to the text:
        </p>
        <h2 class="image-text"><img src="images/using_photoshop-fig-17.png" alt="This is some text" /></h2>
        <p>
          Note that if you
          edit the text (change the words or font or font size, etc.), the layer style will apply to the new text; it is attached to the outlines
          of the letters, not a bit-mapped part of the image.
        </p>

      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div>
				Photoshop and other image editing programs can create more visually compelling web pages than simple XHTML and CSS, but the programs
        tend to be large and complex. This page has introduced some basic Photoshop techniques that you should be able to use without getting
        lost in the program. Start with easy to see effects like the gaudy ones on this web page, experiment with variations on the tools, and
        refine your technique over time. Or not. Even if you never edit an image again, at least you should now have a better idea of what goes
        into preparing images for the web.
