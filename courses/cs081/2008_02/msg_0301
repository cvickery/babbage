  In last Thursday's class I pointed out that you are
  limited to using only fonts that are actually installed on
  the user's computer. The question came up about
  downloading fonts for the user. Here's a link to an
  article that talks about this idea:

    http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten

  You won't understand the details at this point, but it's
  an interesting article anyway, and it is written by the
  person who invented CSS.  The links in the article
  (especially CSS Zen Garden, universally avaiable fonts,
  and Prince) are all very much worth looking at too.
