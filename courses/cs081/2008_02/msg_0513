  The final exam for CS-081 will definitely be Thursday, May
  22 from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm as discussed in class today.

  Our regular classroom will not be available, but I have
  reserved room SB A-103 instead: it has better desks than
  the conference room that was the other alternative.

  I'll update the course web page later this evening.

  Good luck with all your exams, and ...
  ... See you next Thursday!
