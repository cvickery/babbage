  Welcome to the CS-081 mailing list! If you got this
  message, it means that you submitted Assignment 1 and I
  successfully got your address from that email.

  Two things: (1) Your account name ends with '81', not
  '081'. But I'm still not sure whether your initial
  password is '81' or '081' -- you will know you got it
  right when you see a dialog box telling you to change it.
  (2) I've update the web page for Assignment 2 so you can
  do the first assignment. It really is due on the 14th,
  but there is an automatic one week extension if you need
  it. It's "due" on the 14th in the sense that I plan to
  go on to the next assignment then.
