  Here's how everyone did in CS-081:

    The class average on the final exam was 79, and the
    median was 81.

    There were 8 required assignment and one optional one. I
    gave two points for each "ok", one point for each
    "not ok", and 3 points for a "good", so a perfect
    assignment score was 16 points, but it was possible to
    get more than that by getting a "good" or by doing the
    optional assignment. That left 84 points for the two
    exams, 42 points each. Translating your course average
    into a letter grade is a mechanical process dictated by
    college policy.

    There were 6 A's, 4 B's, 0 C's, 1 D, and 2 F's for the
    course.

    Best wishes for a great summer!
