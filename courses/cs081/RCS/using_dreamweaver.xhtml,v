    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <p><span class="programName">Dreamweaver</span> is one of the most
      widely used tools for writing web pages.  It was developed by <a
      href="http://macromedia.com">Macromedia</a>, the same company that
      developed the <a
      href="http://www.macromedia.com/software/flash/flashpro/">Flash</a>
      system for animating web pages.  Macromedia was purchased by <a
      href="http://www.adobe.com">Adobe</a>, the developers of <a
      href="http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/main.html">Acrobat</a> and
      <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativesuite/main.html">Photoshop</a>
      in December, 2005.</p>

      <p>There are plenty of good alternatives to Dreamweaver for serious
      web design work -- and lots of bad alternatives too!  I personally
      prefer to work with a good programmer&rsquo;s editor, such as <a
      href="./using_vim.xhtml"><span class="programName">vim</span></a>, to
      develop my web pages.  But a programmer&rsquo;s editor only
      substitutes for one part of an Integrated Development Environment
      (IDE) such as Dreamweaver, so I have to use separate programs to do a
      lot of the housekeeping operations that are built into
      Dreamweaver.</p>

      <p>Dreamweaver (and all the other components of Macromedia&rsquo;s
      &ldquo;Studio&rdquo; suite of programs, including Flash) is available
      on all the computers in our Lab.  This web page will guide you through
      the process of setting up Dreamweaver so that it is tailored to doing
      projects for this course.</p>

      <p>If your really want to master Dreamweaver, there are lots of
      Dreamweaver books and online tutorials available, and I don&rsquo;t
      claim to have surveyed them well enough to make any serious
      recommendations.  But I have looked at Rachel Andrew&rsquo;s <em>Build
      Your Own Standards Compliant Website Using Dreamweaver 8</em>
      published by Sitepoint and can recommend it.  You can get a copy for
      about $27 from most bookstores, or directly from <a
      href="http://www.sitepoint.com/books/dreamweaver1/">Sitepoint</a>,
      where you can download sample chapters if you want to look at (most)
      of the book before deciding whether to buy it.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Setting Up</h2>

    <div class="whitebox">

      <h5>Open your template.xhtml file in Dreamweaver.</h5> <p
      class="runin">Start Dreamweaver by clicking the green Dreamweaver icon
      on the desktop.  It&rsquo;s a big program, so be patient while you
      wait for it to load.  The big green &ldquo;splash screen&rdquo; that
      comes up in the center has a checkbox at the bottom that says
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show again.&rdquo;  I suggest that you check that
      box simply because we will generally work from the menus that offer
      the same choices.  You should also see a set of panels down the right
      side of thw window called <span class="functionName">CSS</span>, <span
      class="functionName">Application</span>, <span
      class="functionName">Tag Inspector</span>, and <span
      class="functionName">Files</span>.</p>

      <p>The Files panel should be open.  If not, click on it to open it up
      to show the full panel with three tabs: <span
      class="functionName">Files</span>, <span
      class="functionName">Assets</span>, and <span
      class="functionName">Snippets.</span> Use the Files tab to navigate to
      your &ldquo;My Web Pages&rdquo; folder, which will appear under
      &ldquo;<span class="directoryName">C:\Documents and Settings\*\My
      Documents</span>&rdquo;.  You will have to substitute your account
      name (with &ldquo;<span class="fileName">.TREE</span>&rdquo; after it)
      for the asterisk.  Double-click on the <span
      class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> file there to open it for
      editing.  Part of the setup process will be to convert this file into
      a Dreamweaver template, and you will be making some changes to it
      before doing that.</p>

      <h5>Change some Dreamweaver preferences.</h5> <p class="inline">From
      the Edit menu at the top, select Preferences, the bottom item.  This
      opens up a big panel with lots of items, a few of which need to be
      changed.  Select the fourth item, Code Formatting, and make sure the
      following settings are in place: <span class="optionValue">Indent
      (checked) with 2 <em>spaces.</em></span>  <span class="optionName">Tab
      size</span>: a number no larger than 4 (I prefer <span
      class="optionValue">2</span>).  <span class="optionName">Default tag
      case</span>: <span class="optionValue">&lt;lowercase&gt;</span>.
      <span class="optionName">Default attribute case</span>: <span
      class="optionValue">lowercase="value"</span>. <span
      class="optionName">Centering</span>: <span class="optionValue">Use DIV
      tag</span>.</p>

      <p>Next, select &ldquo;<span class="optionName">File Types /
      Editors</span>&rdquo; and change the <span class="optionName">External
      code editor</span> to <span class="programName">gvim.exe</span>.  You
      will have to use the Browse button to locate the current version of
      this program.  At the time this web page was written, the current
      version was in <span class="pathName">C:\Program
      Files\vim\vim63</span>.</p>

      <p>Now go down to the <span class="optionName">New Document</span>
      preferences. Change the <span class="optionName">Default
      extension</span> to <span class="optionValue">.xhtml</span>.  Make the
      <span class="optionName">Default Document Type (DTD)</span> <span
      class="optionValue">XHTML</span> 1.1.  <span class="optionName">Make
      the Default encoding</span> <span class="optionValue">Unicode
      (UTF-8)</span>.</p>

      <p>In the <span class="optionName">Preview in Browser</span> panel,
      make sure <span class="programName">Firefox</span> is set as the
      primary browser and <span class="programName">Internet Explorer</span>
      as the secondary browser.  If there is a third browser already listed,
      it may be set up incorrectly: delete it (with the big <span
      class="functionName">minus</span> button) and add <span
      class="programName">Opera</span>, which is in <span
      class="pathName">C:\ProgramFiles\Opera\opera.exe</span>.</p>

      <p>In the <span class="optionName">Validate</span> panel, turn off the
      checkbox for HTML 4.0 and turn on the one for <span
      class="optionValue">XHTML 1.0 strict</span>.</p>

      <p>Exit the preferences panel and be patient while everything is
      saved.</p>

      <h5>Set up your development directory.</h5> <p class="runin">To make
      sure you are setting up your Dreamweaver site correctly, make the
      following changes to your &ldquo;<span class="directoryName">My Web
      Pages</span>&rdquo; directory: (1) Add three subdirectories to
      &ldquo;<span class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span>,&rdquo; and
      name them <span class="directoryName">css</span>, <span
      class="directoryName">scripts</span>, and <span
      class="directoryName">images</span>.  (You can do this by
      right-clicking on <span class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span> in
      Dreamweaver.)  <em>Be sure to use lowercase names for these
      directories (see note below).</em>  Then edit your template file and
      create a stylesheet and a Javascript program as follows:</p>

      <ul>

          <li>

            <h5>Edit your <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span>
            file.</h5> <p class="runin">First, copy <span
            class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> to <span
            class="fileName">template.xhtml.save</span>.  You are about to
            modify it, and it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep a copy of the
            original so you can get it back in case you make a mistake.</p>

            <p>To edit a file, you must be in either &ldquo;code view&rdquo;
            or &ldquo;split view.&rdquo;  There are buttons underneath the
            tab with the filename on it for switching views.  The keyboard
            shortcut is <span class="optionValue">Ctrl-`</span>.
            (That&rsquo;s a backquote, located in the upper-left corner of
            the keyboard.)</p>

            <p>Change your <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> file
            as follows:  Add a <span class="tagName">link</span> tag to the
            <span class="nodeName">head</span> node of the document with the
            following attributes and values:</p>

            <table>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Attribute</th>
                <th scope="col">Value</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>rel</td>
                <td>stylesheet</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>type</td>
                <td>text/css</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>media</td>
                <td>screen</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>href</td>
                <td>css/screen.css</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

          <p>Now add a <span class="tagName">script</span> tag to the <span
          class="nodeName">head</span> node with the following attributes
          and values:</p>

            <table>
              <tr>
                <th scope="col">Attribute</th>
                <th scope="col">Value</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>type</td>
                <td>text/javascript</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>src</td>
                <td>scripts/template.js</td>
              </tr>
            </table>

            <p>Note that the <span class="nodeName">link</span> node may be
            a single self-closing tag, but the <span
            class="nodeName">script</span> node must have a separate closing
            tag to be compatible with Internet Explorer.  The <span
            class="nodeName">script</span> node itself is empty.</p>

            <div class="standoutBox"><h5>Check your typing to make sure that
            what you typed is what you got.</h5>  <p class="runin">For
            example, Dreamweaver automatically types closing tags for you as
            soon as you type &ldquo;&lt;/&rdquo; so be sure you didn&rsquo;t
            repeat some of the characters it typed for you.  Check that the
            quotes surrounding the attribute values are in the right places
            and that there is at least one whitespace character separating
            the attributes from each other.</p></div>


            <div class="standoutBox"><h5>Be careful about
            capitalization.</h5> <p class="runin">Windows does not
            distinguish between upper and lower case letters in file and
            directory names, but other operating systems, such as Unix,
            Linux, Solaris, and some parts of OS-X (Macintosh) do
            distinguish between them.  To be sure your web site will not
            &ldquo;break&rdquo; when copied to one of these other systems
            (such as the one where I will be testing your projects!) be sure
            to be consistent about the case of directory and filenames
            wherever they appear.  for example, except for the &ldquo;<span
            class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span>&rdquo; directory name,
            all files and directories you will be working with while setting
            up your site will have all lowercase names.  Be sure the values
            of the <span class="attributeValue">href</span> and <span
            class="attributeValue">src</span> attributes in your <span
            class="tagName">link</span> and <span
            class="tagName">script</span> tags have all lowercase
            letters.</p></div>

            <p>Add two <span class="nodeName">div</span> nodes to your
            template, one surrounding the existing <span
            class="nodeName">h1</span> node, and the other one following
            that.  Put an <span class="nodeName">h2</span> node inside the
            second <span class="nodeName">div</span>, with a content of
            &ldquo;Template Content&rdquo;.  Add an <span
            class="attributeName">id</span> attribute to the first <span
            class="tagName">div</span> tag with a value of
            &ldquo;heading&rdquo;, and put an <span
            class="attributeName">id</span> in the second <span
            class="tagName">div</span> with a value of
            &ldquo;content&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>Save your <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span>
            file.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>From the File menu, select New (or just type <span
            class="codeSnippet">Ctrl-N</span>), and a dialog box with two
            tabs will open up.  From the General tab&rsquo;s General
            category, pick a <span class="optionName">Basic page</span> of
            type <span class="optionValue">CSS</span>.  When that page opens
            up, add the following CSS rule under the comment line that will
            already be there:</p>

            <p class="codeBlock">
 html, body {
  background-color: #000;
  color:            #fff;
  }
            </p>

            <p>Pay attention to what is happening as you type this rule.
            Once you type the each colon, Dreamweaver will show you a color
            picker so you can pick the colors you want.  The two values I
            showed above are black for the background and white for the
            foreground, but you can pick any two distinct colors you like so
            long as one is dark and the other is light.  And don&rsquo;t use
            white for the background; the idea is to be able to see easily
            that you have changed the default style for the page, and white
            is the default background color.  (Yes, it would make more sense
            if the foreground color property name was
            &ldquo;foreground-color&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;color&rdquo;
            -- but it isn&rsquo;t.)</p>

            <p>Save your new stylesheet in your
            <span class="directoryName">css</span> directory with the name
            <span class="fileName">screen.css</span>.</p>

          </li>

          <li>

            <p>Create another Basic page as you did for the stylesheet, but
            make this one a <span class="optionValue">Javascript</span>
            file.  Add this one line below the comment at the top of the
            file:</p>

            <p class="codeBlock">
  alert("hello");
            </p>

            <p>You may be creative about what goes inside the quotes, but be
            sure the rest of the spelling and all of the punctuation are
            exactly as shown.  Save the file as <span
            class="fileName">template.js</span> in your <span
            class="directoryName">scripts</span> directory.</p>

          </li>

      </ul>

      <p>At this point, looking at <span
      class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> in &ldquo;split&rdquo; or
      &ldquo;design&rdquo; view (the third alternative to code and split
      views) should show the colors you picked in your stylesheet and the
      bottom line should show a little &ldquo;php&rdquo; icon instead of the
      file&rsquo;s modification date, but the Javascript program
      doesn&rsquo;t do anything yet.  Be sure that Dreamweaver now renders
      your template file in all its colorful glory before proceeding!</p>

      <h5>Set up a Dreamweaver site.</h5> <p class="runin">For this course,
      you will do your initial coding and testing in your &ldquo;<span
      class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span>&rdquo; directory, and then
      do a final test in the web server&rsquo;s document root, <span
      class="directoryName">C:\htdocs</span>.  At this point, you will set
      up a Dreamweaver &ldquo;site&rdquo; so that Dreamweaver can make
      development and final testing easier.  Setting up the site is also a
      prerequisite for converting your <span
      class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> into a Dreamweaver
      template.</p>

      <p>The process has several steps:</p>

      <ol>

        <li>

          <h5>Set up Local Info</h5> <p class="runin">Use the <span
          class="menuItem">Site->New Site</span> menu item to bring up the
          Site Definition panel. There are Basic and Advanced tabs.  The
          Basic tab does not give enough options for setting everything
          up,so switch to the Advanced tab.</p>

          <p>In the <span class="menuItem">Local Info</span> category give a
          name to your web site.  You can use any name you like.  If you
          were using Dreamweaver to manage several different web sites, you
          would give each one a descriptive name so you could keep track of
          them.  For this course a good name might be &ldquo;CS-081.&rdquo;
          Use <span class="nodeValue">http://localhost/</span> as the URL
          for the site.  (This way you will be able to access your site from
          any computer in the lab.)  For the Local root folder, give the
          pathname to your <span class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span>
          directory.  Click the &ldquo;Links relative to Document&rdquo;
          radio button, which will make it easy to move your web site to
          different places relative to the web server&rsquo;s document
          root.</p>

          <p>Be sure to check the &ldquo;case-sensitive link checking&rdquo;
          option.  This feature is critical for making sure your web pages
          will work when I test them on a Unix computer.  To take advantabe
          of this feature, you will have to tell Dreamweaver to perform a
          link check before submitting each assignment.</p>

          <p>The Enable cache option can be checked, although the
          performance benefit of using a cache probably won&rsquo;t be
          evident for the projects in this course.</p>

          <p>If you click OK to close the Site Definition panel, you should
          now see that the Files palette has a drop-down item for your site.
          Whatever name you gave to it should appear, and when you select
          it, you should see the files and folders in your <span
          class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span> with green icons instead
          of yellow ones.  A second drop-down list gives you a choice of
          Local, Testing, or Remote view of your site, but only the Local
          view is ready so far.</p>

        </li>
        
        <li>

          <h5>Set up the Testing Server</h5> <p class="runin">Bring up the
          Site Definition panel again using the <span class="menuItem">Site->Manage
          Site</span> menu item and selecting the Edit option.  Select the
          <span class="menuItem">Testing Server</span> category.</p>

          <p>Leave the <span class="optionName">Server model</span> set to
          <span class="optionValue">None</span>, and Change the <span
          class="optionName">Access</span> choice to <span
          class="optionValue">Local/Network</span>.  Doing this will open up
          a checkbox to &ldquo;Refresh testing file list
          automatically,&rdquo; which should be checked.  For the <span
          class="optionName">URL prefix</span> enter <span
          class="pathName">http://localhost/~youraccount</span>.  You are
          telling Dreamweaver to use that URL to get a browser to bring up
          the web pages under your <span class="directoryName">My Web
          Pages</span> directory.  This works because we set up the Apache
          servers on all the lab computers to use the tilde (~) convention
          for getting to users&rsquo; personal web sites.  Be sure to
          substitute your own account name in the URL, and remember that the
          tilde convention works only on the computer that you are actively
          logged into.</p>

          <p>At this point you can close the Site Definition panel, and get
          Dreamweaver to display your web page in the browsers you set up
          earlier.  First, verify that the Files palette now lets you look
          at your web site using the Testing server view; the folder colors
          will be red instead of green.</p>
          
          <p>If you set up your primary and secondary browsers correctly,
          you should be able to select your <span
          class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> (click in the code, on the
          design view, or select the file in either the Local or Testing
          view of the Files palette) and press <span
          class="tagName">F12</span> to bring up the page in <span
          class="programName">Firefox</span> and to click <span
          class="tagName">Shift-F12</span> to bring it up in Internet
          Explorer.  You can also right-click on the file name in the Local
          or Testing view, and select Opera from the <span
          class="menuItem">View in Browser</span>.  In all cases, your
          JavaScript code should run and display the message you entered
          inside the quotation marks.  The style you set up should display
          correctly, and the PHP code that displays the bottom of the page
          should be replaced with the actual date.</p>

          <h5>Set up Remote Info</h5> <p class="runin">Now set up
          Dreamweaver so you can make sure your pages work correctly outside
          of your <span class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span> folder. 
          Bring up the Site Definition panel for your site again.  This time
          select the <span class="optionName">Remote Info</span> category.
          <span class="optionName">Access</span> should again be <span
          class="optionValue">Local/Network</span>, and <span
          class="optionName">Remote folder</span> should be <span
          class="directoryName">C:\htdocs</span>.  Check the &ldquo;<span
          class="optionName">Refresh &hellip;</span>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<span
          class="optionName">Maintain &hellip;</span>, &rdquo; and <span
          class="optionName">Automatically &hellip;</span> options, and
          leave the <span class="optinName">Enable &hellip;</span> option
          unchecked.</p>
          
          <p>With this setup, each time you save a file under <span
          class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span>, it will automatically
          be copied to <span class="directoryName">C:\htdocs\</span>.  If
          you would rather do the copying manually for some reason, you can
          uncheck the third item on this panel.  There are big arrows in the
          Files panel that you can click to copy all or part of your site
          &rsquo; to <span class="directoryName">C:\htdocs\</span> from
          <span class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span> or &rsquo; to go
          the other way.  Manual transfers are useful when you have a site
          where the remote computer is ... remote ... rather than on the
          same computer as you are working on.</p>
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
        
          <h5>Set a Templates option if it is available.</h5> <p
          class="runin">While the Site Definition panel is still open, look
          to see if there is a <span class="optionName">Template</span> item
          at the bottom of the list of categories on the left side of the
          panel. If it is there, select it and make sure the <span
          class="optionName">Template Updating</span> checkbox is checked. 
          This category was added in an update to Dreamweaver and might not
          appear in the version you are working with.</p>

          <p>Click OK on the setup panel and then Done on the Manage Sites
          panel.</p>

        <li>
        
          <h5>Test your remote server setup and validate your code.</h5> <p
          class="runin">You may need to do the initial copying of your site
          to <span class="directoryName">C:\htdocs</span> explicitly even if
          you have selected the automatic copying option.  Click on the site
          in the Files palette, and click on the big up arrow icon.  You
          will be asked whether you want to save the entire site: click
          yes.  This will create the subdirectories and copy all your
          files.</p>
          
          <p class="standoutBox">Remember, <span
          class="directoryName">C:\htdocs</span> is shared by everyone who
          uses one of the computers in the lab.  When you first log into a
          machine, it would be a good idea to remove anything in that
          directory that someone else might have left there and to copy your
          entire site over to get it initialized.</p>
          
          <p>Switch to <span class="programName">Firefox</span> and type the
          following URL into the location (<span
          class="tagName">Ctrl-L</span>) bar: <span
          class="optionValue">http://computer.cs.qc.edu/template.xhtml</span>
          -- substitute the actual name of the computer your are working on
          for the word &ldquo;computer&rdquo; in that URL.  The <span
          class="functionName">alert</span> box should come up, your page
          should then load with your styled background color, and the date
          should appear in place of the PHP code at the bottom.  If not, fix
          whatever is wrong!</p>

          <p>The template file I provided has two links at the bottom for
          validating your XHTML and CSS code using the validator programs
          provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (w3.org).  There are
          also two validation icons in the status bar at the bottom of your
          Firefox window.  Both should be green circles with white
          checkmarks in them.  If not, click on the <span
          class="programName">Tidy</span> icon, which is normally a yellow
          triangle when it is not a green circle.  The problems with your
          code will be indicated there; fix your code before proceeding.</p>
          
          <p>Click the XHTML and CSS links at the bottom of your web page,
          and the W3C validators will make more refined checks of your code
          and style sheets.  Both should indicate no errors or warnings.</p>
          
          <p class="standoutBox">The W3C validators will find your web pages
          only if you have used an actual computer name to open the web
          page.  If the URL is <span
          class="pathName">http://localhost/&hellip;</span> the validators
          will not be able to access the pages to validate them.</p>

        </li>
        
        <li>
        
          <h5>Check for broken links.</h5> <p class="runin">Your web site
          could pass all tests so far and still not work when I test it on
          babbage, which uses case sensitive file and directory names as
          mentioned above.  When you set up your site, one of the options
          you should have turned on was to do case-sensitive link checks. 
          To perform this test, go to <span
          class="menuItem">File->Check&nbsp;Page->Check&nbsp;Links</span>. 
          (Or right click on any file or directory in the Files palette and
          select <span class="optionValue">Entire Site</span> from the <span
          class="menuItem">Check Links</span> menu item.</p>

          <p>If it is not already visible, a panel will show up below the
          editing window.  There should be an empty white section and below
          that a line that ends with &ldquo;2 OK, 0 Broken, 2
          External.&rdquo;  If it doesn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;0 Broken&rdquo;
          there will be a line in the white section for each broken link. 
          The the right end of those lines will be a file browser button
          that you can use to browse to the correct file.  But because this
          is Windows, Dreamweaver will report capitalization errors here,
          but you won&rsquo;t be able to fix them by browsing to the
          &ldquo;correct&rdquo; file.  So you have to go back to the code
          for your <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> file and fix
          the capitalization there.</p>
          
          <p>That panel with the link check results takes up valuable space,
          which you can recover by clicking the little down arrow above it
          to hide it.</p>

        </li>
        
        <li>
        
          <h5>Create a Dreamweaver Template for new documents.</h5> <p
          class="runin">Now that you have verified that your site structure
          has been set up correctly and that your <span
          class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> file is properly linked to
          a stylesheet and a client-side script correctly, you can proceed
          with confidence to creating a Template that Dreamweaver can use to
          start new web pages for you.  We haven&rsquo;t done anything with
          images yet, but we can fix that later if necessary.</p>
          
          <p>Be sure  you are editing your <span
          class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> file.  Select the
          &ldquo;<span class="menuItem">File->Save As Template
          &hellip;</span>&rdquo; menu item, which will bring up a dialog
          box.  There should be a place for you to put in a Description,
          where you should type something meaningful, like &ldquo;CS-081
          Standard Template.&rdquo;  If there is no name in the &ldquo;Save
          as&rdquo; field in the bottom part of the dialog box, put in
          &ldquo;template&rdquo; (no quotes).  Click Save, and when it asks
          you whether to update links, click OK.</p>

          <p>After some rumination on Dreamweaver&rsquo;s part, you should
          see a new directory named <span
          class="directoryName">Templates</span> in the Local and Testing
          views of your site, and if you
          open it up, you should see a file named <span
          class="fileName">template.dwt</span>.  If it isn&rsquo;t already
          open for editing, double-click on <span
          class="fileName">template.dwt</span> and make the following
          changes:  Find the text that says, &ldquo;&lt;!--
          TemplateBeginEditable name="head" --&gt;&rdquo; and move it to a
          separate line above your <span class="tagName">link</span> tag. 
          Fix up indentation, and your <span class="nodeName">head</span>
          node should look like this:</p>

          <div class="codeBlock">
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="doctitle" --&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;CS-081 Course Template&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;!-- TemplateEndEditable --&gt;
    &lt;!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="head" --&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="../css/screen.css" /&gt;
    &lt;script type="text/javascript" src="../scripts/template.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;!-- TemplateEndEditable --&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
          </div>

          <p>You also need to create an editable region for the body of your
          new documents by inserting a pair of comment lines to surround
          that node in your document.  Select everything between the opening
          and closing <span class="tagName">body</span> tags (not including
          the tags themselves), and use the Insert->Template
          Objects->Editable Region menu item to do this.  Use
          &ldquo;body&rdquo; as the name of the region. Your code formatting
          will probably be messed up horribly.  After adding the comment
          lines and fixing indentation, your <span
          class="nodeName">body</span> node should look like this:</p>

          <div class="codeBlock">
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;!-- TemplateBeginEditable name="body" --&gt;
    &lt;div id="header"&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;CS-081 Course Template&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id="content"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;Template Content&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id="footer"&gt;
      &lt;hr /&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer"&gt;
        XHTML&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;-&nbsp;
        &lt;a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer"&gt;
        CSS&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last updated
        &lt;?php echo gmdate("Y-m-d", filemtime($_SERVER['SCRIPT_FILENAME']));
        ?&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;!-- TemplateEndEditable --&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
          </div>

          <p>Save your <span class="fileName">template.dwt</span> file (type
          <span class="optionValue">Ctrl-S</span>).  There should be no
          warning messages, but you might get a message about the fact that
          your remote site is being updated.</p>

          <p class="standoutBox">Uncheck the &ldquo;Update page
