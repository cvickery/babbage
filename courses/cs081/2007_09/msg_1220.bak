  Grades for the course are posted now. But I still have to
  review them before I sumbit them to the Registrar's
  office.

  There were 35 exam questions, and the number of questions
  missed ranged from 5.5 to 26. (There were two questions
  where I gave half credit for one of the "wrong" choices.)
  I calculted the exam scores by subtracting 5 from the
  number of questions missed, multiplying that number by 3,
  and subtracting from 100. That gave a class average of
  82.1 for the exam, with the median 87.5. The big
  difference between the average and median means there were
  a couple of really low scores that brought down the
  average; the median (middle) value is relatively immune to
  this sort of thing.

  The quiz counted 3%, the assignments 12% (two points for
  each of the first six, plus a bonus if you submitted
  Assignment 7), and the exam average counted the other 85%.
  If you missed the quiz, your course average was computed
  the same way, but then divided by 0.97 to make up the
  missing 3%.

  Best wishes for the rest of exams and for the holidays,
  Dr. Vickery
