  The History Department at the college is looking for a
  student to help them put together a web site about Queens
  College students who served in World War II. You may have
  seen the memorial plaque by the flag pole behind Jefferson
  Hall, which is part of the whole project.

  This would be a part-time job, with the goal to have at
  least the first part of a rather ambitious project
  finished during the spring term. I'm sure you would learn
  a lot and gain good experience in web design by working on
  the project.

  The contact person in the History Department is Dr.
  Wintermute. If you are interested, you should send an
  email directly to him: bobby.wintermute@qc.cuny.edu. He is
  eager to start as quickly as possible.

  Regards,
  Dr. Vickery
