  In Thursday's class I had trouble applying a rule to the
  navigation link on the "current" page.  The problem, I am
  embarrassed to admit, was exactly the same one I had in a
  previous class: I had used #navlist as the selector instead of
  #navList (capitalization of the L). So this rule works fine to
  remove the background image from an item of class "current"
  inside the div with id "navList":

    #navlist .current {
      background-image: none;
      }

  Here's a challenge: Try putting a bottom border on the navList
  div (like my code in class), but make the part of it under the
  "current" menu tab disappear.

  Good luck with the assignment!
