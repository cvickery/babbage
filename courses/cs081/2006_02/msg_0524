  I was reviewing the Javascript Tutorial web page while
  working on the final exam (hint, hint!) and I spotted an
  error that needed to be fixed: there are several
  references to "window.object" that were supposed to say
  "window.onload".  I've uploaded a fixed version now; there
  are some other minor typos fixed in today's version too.

  I'm not posting answers to last semester's exam, but it is
  perfectly all right to put up what you think are correct
  answers on the discussion board and see what others in the
  class think.  Note that the sample images on last
  semester's exam all come from a web page that we didn't
  use this semester, so I suggest you don't spend too much
  time trying to figure that part of the exam out.

  See you bright and early tomorrow (Thu) morning!
