
  First, a reminder that the final exam will be open book.  The idea
  is that you may use any reference material you want during the exam,
  EXCEPT friends and electronic devices!

  Last semester's final exam is available from the course calendar.
  Watch out, it's a large file because it contains several images.  As
  usual, you exam will not look like last semester's (expect no
  images; expect more on Javascript), but it is there if you are
  interested.  I will not be posting answers.  If you want to discuss
  the questions, I suggest you use the course discussion forum.

  Reminder: the username and password for accessing last
  semester's exams are 'cs081' and 'web'.

  Also, I posted a new message on the forum with information
  about the Javascript tutorial.

  Finally, a note that my comments in Tuesday's class about
  connecting code to a form using only a separate Javascript
  source file were correct.  The tutorial reflects this
  info.

  Good luck on your exams and projects!  I'll see you bright and early
  next Thursday.
