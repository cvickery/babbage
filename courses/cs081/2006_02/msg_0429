
  I have finally uploaded the web page for Assignment 7.  There is no
  code to write, just a few questions to answer, so I've made the due
  date Tuesday.

  Your final assignment will be to develop a page with a form (or
  multiple forms) for an application of your choice, such as a blog,
  discussion forum, shopping cart, library catalog, ... whatever.  Of
  course, there won't be a real database for you to work with, but I
  plan to provide you with a means for getting information from an xml
  file for testing purposes.  Meantime, you can be thinking about what
  your application will be and what you want your form(s) to look like
  and do.

  And I'm still working on my web server's "multipart/form-data"
  problems ...
