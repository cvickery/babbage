
  First, this is to let everyone know that I have received a lot of
  homework assignments that I haven't acknowledged yet.  So if you
  have submitted something in the last day or two and haven't heard
  back from me yet, don't panic; I most likely did indeed receive your
  mail.

  Second, I updated the _vimrc file in the lab so you can use the
  following keyboard shortcuts:

    Alt-'   Inserts the right-single quote character entity
    Alt-"   If you have something selected (use either the mouse or
            the "v" command to select text), surrounds the selection
            with the left-double-quote and right-double-quote
            character entities.

  If you are using Dreamweaver, you can set this sort of thing up by
  creating your own "Snippets."  For example, if you look at the
  lower-right panel, you should see a panel with three tabs called
  Files, Assets, and Snippets.  Click the Snippets tab and click the
  third icon from the left at the bottom of the Snippets panel ("New
  Snippet").  In the dialog boxt that comes up give a name to your
  snippet, like Double Quotes, be sure the Snippet type is Wrap
  selection, put &ldquo; in the Insert before box, and put &rdquo; in
  the Insert after box.  For the single quote, you would check the
  Insert block option instead of Wrap selection.  Then either
  right-click on yur snippet and select Edit keyboard shortcuts or go
  to the Edit menu, select Keyboard shortcuts, and under Commands
  change Menu Commands to Snippets.  Then you can specify what key you
  want to use to use to insert the quotes.

  Let me know if you have any problems with using character entities
  for quotes.
