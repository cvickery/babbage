
  First, a reminder that Friday's midterm will be open textbook.  The
  idea is that you can use your textbook to look things up if you need
  to.  But it's not pure open book: no notebooks, calculators, cell
  phones, computers, etc., etc.  Just your textbook with no extra
  papers in it.

  Second, your CSS for Assignment 5 will not validate unless you
  either remove the links in the course template to the two style
  sheets not used in this assignment or create empty stylesheets for
  the two unused links.

  See you Friday ...
