  answer even though there were only 32 questions.  But each part of
  Question 30 ("Circle all correct answers for this one") was worth
  half a point, so that question counted only 2.5 instead of 3
  points.  The highest score was 96.5, so I added a 4 point curve to
  everyone's raw score.  The grade posted is your score after the
  curve.

  The range of curved scores was from 56 to 100, with a mean of 83.9
  and a median of 88.  There were 7 scores in the 90-100 range (A's),
  4 in the 80-89 range (B's), 4 in the 70-79 range (C's), one in the
  60-69 range (D's), and one below 60 (F).

  I am making next Tuesday, March 28, the final cutoff date for all
  assignments through Assignment 5.  After then, you will not be able
  to resubmit or correct any of those assignments.  But until then you
  can submit or resubmit anything to get your grades raised.

  Have a great weekend,
