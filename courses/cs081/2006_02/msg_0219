  This is my first message of the semester using my mailing list for
  CS-081.
  
  If that's not your name at the beginning of this message, let me
  know.  That would mean that I've messed up my mailing list somehow.

  Two items of business in this message:

    1.  I updated the Assignment 2 web page with a link to a new page
    on how to put Flash movies in your web pages.  It's a lot easier
    to do than the technique I showed in class last Friday.

    2.  Don't forget that there will be no class this Tuesday because
    the college will follow a Monday schedule, and there will be no
    class the following Tuesday (the 28th) because I will be out of
    town.

  In general, I'll assume that you will be checking the course
  Discussion Forum to get messages from me as well as to help each
  other with the assignments.  But I wanted to put this mailing list
  system in order too.  Messages I send to this list will always have
  CS-081 as the first part of the Subject line.
