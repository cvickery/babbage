
  I just uploaded Version 1.8 of EchoHTTPRequests.jar.  It seems to
  handle multipart/form-data (what's used when uploading files) okay
  now.  Download the new version, and let me know if you find any
  problems with it.  (The title bar has the version number in it; be
  sure you are using version 1.8 rather than 1.7 from now on.)

  To celebrate, I've updated the assignment web page and added another
  Activity Question for you to answer.
