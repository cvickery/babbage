

  Exam and course grades for CS-081 are posted now.

  For the final exam, everyone missed at least one question, so I
  reduced the number of questions by one.  That is, I scored the exam
  as if there were 43 questions instead of 44.  So if your exam score
  on the web is 100, it means you missed one question, etc.  The
  curved exam average was 76.3, and the median curved score was 79.1

  The final course grade consisted of 10% for the homework
  assignments, 10% for the final assignment, and 80% for the average
  of the two exams.  For the homeworks, each "ok" was worth 2 points,
  and each "not ok" was worth one.  With 7 homeworks, that meant the
  maximum score was 14, so your homework score was 10 times the number
  of homework points divided by 14.

  For the course, there were 5 A's (course average over 90), 4 B's
  (course average in the 80's), 2 C's (average in the 70's), 2 D's
  (average in the 60's), and 2 F's.

  I encourage you to let me know how you think the course might be
  improved in the future.  It won't do you any good, but the students
  who follow you would appreciate it!

  Best wishes for the summer,
  Dr. Vickery
