  First, the web page for Assignment 4 is available now.  It's a
  short assignment, but it's not due until November 14.  See the
  next item for why.

  Second, I'm cancelling class for November 11 (a week from this
  Friday).  I'll be in Las Vegas learning about Microsoft's web
  design strategy.  I'll discuss options for making up the missed
  class this Friday.
