I posted a message to the course discussion forum that provides links
to the code from today's class and answers a couple of questions that
came up in class.  I think this simpler set of files will help you
understand what you are doing in the assignment due today.

If you don't already have an account on the forum
(http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/phpBB2), this would be the time to sign up
for one.

See you Friday,
Dr. Vickery
