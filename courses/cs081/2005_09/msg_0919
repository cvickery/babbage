
  This is the first message going out to the CS-018 mailing
  list this semester, so despite the semester being three
  weeks old already: Welcome!

  The web site for the course has been updated quite a bit:
  check it out at:
    http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs081/2005_09
  Click on the Class Meetings and Assignments link, and
  you'll find the class schedule for the semester, along
  with the reading assignments so far.  The assignments page
  also has a link to the page for Assignment 1, the one you
  have been working on.  The due date is noted there too:
  this Tuesday.

  There is also a link to a Discussion Forum for the course
  on the web site for the course; you can use it to ask for
  and give help on course-related issues.  I'll read the
  messages posted there, but it's really intended for
  students to interact with each other.

  See you Tuesday,
  Dr. Vickery
