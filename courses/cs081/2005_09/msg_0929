  The full version of Macromedia Studio 8, which includes Dreamweaver,
  Flash, and some other web development tools (Fireworks, Flashpaper,
  Contribute) has now been installed on:

    Apple
    Birch
    Cherry
    Chestnut
    Elm
    Ginko
    Hemlock
    Hickory
    
  You can access all of these machines from off campus using Remote
  Desktop, and all except Apple are available in room A-205 whenever
  the room is open.

  Note: there is no printer in room 205.  If you try to print
  something from one of the lab computers it will go to a printer that
  is locked away in room 227, and you won't be able to get your
  output.
