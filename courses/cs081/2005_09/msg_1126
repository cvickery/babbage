  First a reminder that the last day to submit assignments 1-4 for
  credit will be this coming Tuesday, the 29th.  Each of these
  assignments will count 2% of your final grade; you will get the full
  2% for each "ok", or 1% if you submit the assignment but get a "not
  ok."

  Second, the web page for Assignment 5 is up now; there is a link to
  it from the course assignments page.  I'm trying to cover a lot of
  new material in these last few weeks of the semester, so it pays to
  get started on this assignment right away.  I plan to give one more
  assignment after this.

  The final exam will be December 21.  I'm thinking one good set of
  quesions would be to give you separate screen shots of the top and
  bottom halves of the Assignment 5 web page and have you match the
  settings in the top part with the visual effects on the bottom.
  What do you think?  (A good discussion topic for the course forum!)

  See you next week!
