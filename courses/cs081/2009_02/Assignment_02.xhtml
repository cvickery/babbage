      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          For the projects in this course, you will be using the computers in the department&rsquo;s TREE lab. You may
          use an off-campus computer to write the code for your assignments if that is more convenient for you, but
          final testing and project submission have to be done using the lab computers. The purpose of this assignment
          is to get you up and running with the laboratory computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many college courses, a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; is a place where you go to do supervised course work. But
          in this course it is significantly different: there is indeed a laboratory where you can go to do your course
          work but (a) you can do your assignments using any computer that is configured properly if you prefer not to
          go to the laboratory, and (b) there is no supervision in the laboratory.  Rather, you can use the laboratory
          to do your assignments any time it is convenient for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, you are not completely abandoned with regard to laboratory assignments! In addition to the
          guidelines provided by assignment web pages such as this one, you can always ask me for help if you are
          working in the lab during my regular <a href="../../../contact_info.xhtml">office hours</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a <a href="http://babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/Fora/Courses/viewforum.php?f=1">bulletin board</a> set
          up for the course where you can ask questions and discuss assignments with the other students in the course. I
          monitor the bulletin board and will contribute answers to the discussions there too. Bulletin boards are
          popular haunts for spammers, so access to it is restricted: you have to give a user name and password in a
          pop-up box when you first get there (the user name is 'vickery-student'; I will give the password out in
          class, or you can send me email requesting it), and then you have to register as a user to be able to post
          messages/questions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          If you have not done so already, read the <a href="../../TREE_Lab/">TREE Lab</a> web page. If you prefer to
          access the computers remotely, be sure to read the <a href="../../TREE_Lab/using_scp.xhtml">Working From Off
          Campus</a> web page as well. Once you have digested that information, do the following:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>Log into your account and check your roaming profile.</h5>
            <p>
              We have had difficulties getting Windows&rsquo; &ldquo;roaming profile&rdquo; feature to work in the past,
              but think we now have it set up to operate reliably now. This first step is to make sure we have it right.
            </p>
            <p>
              Decide on the password you want to use for this course (you can always change it later), and log into one
              of the computers in the lab, either while sitting at one of the machines in room A-205, or by using <span
              class="programName">Remote Desktop Connection</span> (RDC). After you enter your user name and password,
              you will get a notice saying that you have to change your password. Click on that and you will get to the
              dialog box for actually setting up your new password.
            </p>
            <p>
              Remember that it may take several minutes for your &ldquo;roaming profile&rdquo; to initialize the first
              time, so please be patient.
            </p>
            <p>
              To check your roaming profile, you need to create a file so you can see if it gets copied back to the
              server successfully when you log off.  The easiest way to do this is to right-click on the desktop and
              select <span class="menu-item">New->Text File</span> from the context menu that opens up. The file will
              appear on your desktop. You don&rsquo;t need to do anything with it; just create it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now log off. Again, you need to be patient the first time while your new roaming profile gets copied back
              to the server. Wait a minute or two after your log off completes before proceeding to the next step.
            </p>
            <p>
              Log onto a different computer (using your new password). When the desktop comes up, you should see the
              file you created in on the other computer there. This verifies that your roaming profile works and that
              you can do your work on any computer in the lab.
            </p>
            <p class="standout-box">
              Always pay attention to what happens when you log in to or out of any computer in the lab. If your roaming
              profile does not work, you will get a message telling you about the problem. Report the problem to Dr.
              Vickery, and use your home directory on your <span class="directoryName">H:</span> drive to make a copy of
              your work on the server as described in the <a href="../../TREE_Lab/index.xhtml">TREE Lab Information</a>
              web page.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Install the course template page in your website</h5>
            <p>
              Download <a href="../template.zip">template.zip</a> and extract the contents to the <span
              class="directoryName">My Website</span> folder that is already in your <span class="directoryName">My
              Documents</span> folder. The file you extract will be named <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span>.
              Open one of the web browsers available (Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, or Opera), and type in the URL
              for your web site&rsquo;s root: <span
              class="url">http://<em>hostname</em>.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~<em>username</em>/</span>, substituting the name of
              the computer you are logged into for <em>hostname</em> and your own login ID for <em>username</em>. You
              should see a directory listing for the contents of your <span class="directoryName">My Website</span>
              folder, including <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> and a link to <span
              class="directoryName">Parent Directory</span>. If you click on the link to <span
              class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> you should see a web page that looks like this:
            </p>
            <p>
              <img src="images/Assignment_02_Figure_01.png" alt="Screenshot" width="200" />
            </p>
            <p>
              If you are unable to follow these directions and get the results indicated, check each step carefully to
              see if you can figure out for yourself what went wrong. Get help if you need to: from Dr. Vickery, from
              friends, from fellow students, from your Mother, or from anyone else who can help you figure out what went
              wrong. But do not proceed to the next step until this step is working perfectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you wish, you can log out now and proceed to the next step later; your roaming profile will let you
              pick up right where you left off, using any computer in the TREE lab.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Set up a Dreamweaver local site for your web site</h5>
            <p>
              If you are working from outside the lab and do not have access to Dreamweaver, you won&rsquo;t be able to
              do this step; do the equivalent operations using whatever development tools you decide to work with, such
              as Apatana Studio and WinSCP.
            </p>
            <p>
              As demonstrated in class, start Dreamweaver and open the Manage Sites menu using either the <span
              class="menuItem">Site</span> menu or by clicking on the drop-down list at the top of the Files tab of the
              Files panel on the right side of the application. Click on <span class="menuItem">New Site</span>, switch
              to the Advanced tab. Select Local Information, and Fill in the site name (any name you like); the local
              root folder (your <span class="directoryName">My Website</span> directory); the default images folder
              (create a folder named <span class="directoryName">images</span> in your My Website directory); be sure
              links are relative to the Document; leave the HTTP address blank; and <strong>be sure the case-sensitive
              link checking option is selected</strong>. Decide now how you want ot capitalize your images folder (the
              convention is all lower-case). You will have to be sure to capitalize links to it exactly the same way
              later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Save your new site and observe that the file pane on the right now shows just your site and that the folder
              icons there are green instead of yellow.
            </p>
            <p>
              Duplicate <span class="fileName">template.xhtml</span> by clicking on it and typing Control-D. Rename the copy
              by clicking on its name twice (slowly, not a double-click), which will make the name editable. Make the new name
              <span class="fileName">index.xhtml</span>. This file name must be all lowercase. Change the <span 
              class="tagName">title</span> and <span class="tagName">h1</span>
              elements&rsquo; contents from &ldquo;CS-081 Course Template&rdquo; to &ldquo;My CS-081 Website&rdquo; or any other
              name you would like to use. Be sure to save your work, switch to Firefox, and access your web site using a URL in the
              form <span class="url">http://hostname.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~username/</span>. Note that there is no file name at the end of
              this URL. Your index page should be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
            	If you are using a computer outside the lab, be sure you copy your work to your <span class="directoryName">My Website</span>
              directory in the lab.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <h2>Submit The Assignment</h2>
      <div class="whitebox">
      	<p>
        	Log out of your account and be sure your roaming profile is copied back to the server successfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submit the assignment by midnight of the due date:
