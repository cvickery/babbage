  This is the first mailing I am sending to the students in my CS-081 course this semester. The purpose is to let you
  know that the web page for Assignment 3 is ready and linked to the course schedule page now.
  
    If you receive this message but are not taking my course, let me know!

    If your name is not spelled correctly above, let me know!

    I can add more email addresses for you to my mailing list if you like getting multiple copies of my
    messages. Just let me know what addresses you want me to add.

    And if you are taking my course but did not receive this meassage, be especially sure to let me know!

  Have a great weekend,
  Dr. Vickery
