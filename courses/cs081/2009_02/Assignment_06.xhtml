      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div>
      	<p>
        	For this assignment, you are to use Photoshop to prepare images for use as background images
        	  and <span class="tagName">img</span> elements.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Reference Material</h2>

      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <div>
      	<p>
        	Be sure you have completed <a href="Assignment_05.xhtml">Assignment 5</a> successfully before you start working on this one.
          It is too late to receive credit for Assignment 4, but you cannot receive credit for this assignment without completing that one first.
        </p>
        <p>
        	For this assignment, you are to create/edit three images files using Photoshop:
        </p>
        <ol>
        	<li>
          	<h3 id="gradient-target">A background gradient</h3>
            <p>
            	Create a gradient image file which, when tiled vertically (<span class="code-snippet">background-repeat:repeat-y;</span>), will create a
              linear
              gradient across all <span class="tag-name">h2</span> elements of the blog page. The left end of the gradient may be any solid color that
              contrasts with the text in the <span class="tag-name">h2</span> elements, and the right end must be transparent. Change the background
              color of the <span class="tag-name">h2</span> elements to different values to be sure the transparency feature is working.
            </p>
            <p>
            	You may experiment with different dimensions for this image, and it may be as small as one pixel tall. But you may make it taller
              so you can see what you are doing. Make the image at least 600 pixels wide.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The heading at the beginning of this section is an example of what your headings might look like. The gradient is dark green on the left
              end and transparent on the right end. The background color is red. If you have JavaScript
              enabled, you can click on the heading to see the same background image but with different background colors. (Changing the background
              colors using JavaScript is not part of your assignment!)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          	<h3 id="tiled-image-target">A tiled picture background</h3>
            <p>
            	For this part of the assignment, you are to create image from a JPEG photograph, and edit it so the left and right edges blend seamlessly.
              Make the image 128 pixels square (JPEG compression works on blocks that are 16 pixels square, so it can sometimes help to use
              intrinsic sizes that are multiples of 16 in both dimensions&mdash;but there is no need to be a slave to this rule.) You may make the image
              smaller if you like, but make it square and small enough so that it will have to be repeated several times horizontally to fill
              the background of the <span class="tag-name">h1</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Use your image as a background that tiles horizontally behind the <span class="tag-name">h1</span> element of your blog page, similar
              to the demonstration in class. Use any JPEG image you think would be appropriate, but be sure the background looks like one wide
              picture when it is repeated horizontally across the <span class="tag-name">h1</span> element.
            </p>
            <p>
            	The heading at the beginning of this section illustrates the effect you are trying to accomplish. This heading clearly repeats, but
              you cannot see where one copy of the image ends and the next copy begins.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
          	<h3>A text replacement image</h3>
            <p>
            	Use Photoshop to create an image to replace the <span class="tag-name">h1</span> content of your blog page. Use a font that is
              &ldquo;distinctive&rdquo; (i.e., not commonly found on people&rsquo;s computers; explore the fonts installed with Photoshop), put the text
              on a transparent background, and use layer styles to make the text &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; and to make it stand out from the background
              image you created in the previous step.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      	<p>
          Use the web developer&rsquo;s toolbar to disable all images, and reload the page. Verify that a visitor can still read all the headings.
          This screenshot shows a user about to click on the web developer&rsquo;s toolbar option to disable all images:
