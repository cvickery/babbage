  The most embarrassing thing about this one is that it's
  not the first time I've had this problem, and I should
  have seen it right away: The id was navList (with a
  captial L) but I wrote the selector as #navlist (with a
  lower case L). But I was right about one thing: I didn't
  have a clue during class what was going on. Apologies.

  Now I'll go finish that assignment web page.
