  I've posted the final exam and course grades. These are
  not the official grades; I need to check everything over
  again before I send the official grades to the registrar.

  Here's what you will see when you check your grades
  online: First, there is a row with your "Assignments"
  score given as a percentage. It was possible to get over
  100% for this part of the grade because a grade of "good"
  counted as extra credit. The class average for the
  assignments was 80%.

  There were 34 questions on the final exam: 26 numbered
  questions, but some of them had multiple parts and counted
  more. There is a row marked "X/34" that tells how many
  questions you missed out of 34. There was a curve for the
  exam: I multiplied points missed by 100/35 instead of
  100/34, and subtracted from 104 instead of 100. Despite
  the curve, the class average was low, only 75 compared to
  a class average of 81 on the midterm.

  Your course average was based on 16% for the assignments,
  and 42% for each exam. The conversion of course averages
  into letter grades is a mechanical process dictated by the
  college's grading policy.

  You will also see your class rank for the two exams and
  for the whole course. For the midterm, the lowest rank was
  14; for the final and for the course, the lowest ranks
  were both 13.

  Overall, there were 2 A's, 3 B's, 6 C's, 2 D's, and no
  F's.

  Best wishes to everyone for a Happy New Year!
