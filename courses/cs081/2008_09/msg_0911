  While you are waiting for me to post the web page for the
  second assignment, you may be having trouble accessing
  your account in the lab. The problem is that I said the
  accounts names end in "081" and that the initial password
  is "081" -- but they were set up without the zeros. So if
  your name is Abc, your account name is abc81 rather than
  abc 081.  Sorry for the confusion.
