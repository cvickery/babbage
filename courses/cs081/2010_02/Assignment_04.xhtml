        <p>
          This assignment continues the topic of CSS selectors, which are covered in pages 18 through 24 of the textbook.
        </p>
        <h3>Reminder:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            See the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-css3-selectors-20090310/#selectors">table of selectors
            in the W3C CSS specification</a> for a list of all selectors. But pay attention to the “First defined
            in CSS Level” column on the right. CSS Level 3 has not actually been formally adopted yet, and not all
            browsers support all CSS 3 selectors. It’s all right to use Level 3 selectors, they just might not
            have any effect in certain browsers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To prepare for this assignment, make the following changes to the XHTML markup of your
              <span class="file-name">index.xhtml</span> page:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Remove all <span class="attribute-name">class</span> and <span class="attribute-name">id</span> attributes
                from all elements in the <span class="tag-name">body</span> of the page.
              </li>
              <li>
                Change the structure of the nested lists between the first and second paragraphs so it is triply-nested.
                Make all three lists <span class="tag-name">ol</span> lists. (Before, the inner list was an unordered
                list.) Add the new list inside the <em>second</em> item of the inner list, and change the wording to
                remove the inappropriate references to bullets:
                <ol>
                  <li>First item
                    <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                      <li>First subitem</li>
                      <li>Second subitem
                        <ol style="list-style-type:decimal;">
                          <li>First sub-subitem</li>
                          <li>Second sub-subitem</li>
                          <li>Third sub-subitem</li>
                        </ol>
                      </li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Second item</li>
                  <li>Third item</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify that there are no validation warnings or errors, and check that your web page looks something like
            this screenshot. Your colors might well be different from these, and you might have selected different
            words in the first paragraph to have spans. (Only two of the three spanned words show in this screenshot.)
            <img src="images/Figure_04.1.png" alt="Screenshot of upper part of index page at start of assignment." />
            <p>
              Check the bottom of the page: the two validation links should also be in italics:
            </p>
            <div>
              <img src="images/Figure_04.2.png"
              alt="Screenshot of lower left corner of index page at start of the assignment." />
            </div>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <h2>The Assignment</h2>
      <div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>Style the spanned elements in the first paragraph.</h5>
            <p>
              All <span class="tag-name">span</span> elements in the page (and all <span class="tag-name">a</span>
              elements) are italic. Select just the <span class="tag-name">span</span> elements that are inside
              paragraphs, and make the content color blue. The CSS rule should have
              this selector:
              <span class="code-snippet">p span</span>. The attribute name is <span class="attribute-name">color</span>,
              and the attribute value should be <span class="attribute-value">blue</span>. You can pick a different
              color name, but be sure it is easy to see easily compared to the black text in the rest of the paragraph, and
              be sure it is dark enough to show up against your pargagraph’s background color.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first letter of the word in the first span in the paragraph is inside a nested span. Make it larger,
              bold, and red. This will require another CSS rule with <span class="code-snippet">p span span</span>
              for the selector, and you will have to have set three properties in this rule,
              <span class="property-name">color</span>, <span class="property-name">font-weight</span>, and
              <span class="property-name">font-size</span>. Values you could use are
              <span class="property-value">red</span>, <span class="property-value">bold</span>, and
              <span class="property-value">1.2em</span> respectively. But feel free to experiment, provided all three
              properties are applied to the first letter of the first word in the first paragraph.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stop and look at your page, and be sure it has all the correct appearance features and that there are no
              validation warnings or errors. There is no point in continuing to other parts of the assignment if any of
              this is not working correctly. Here’s a screenshot of part of the first paragraph at this point:
            </p>
            <div>
              <img src="images/Figure_04.3.png" alt="Screenshot of first paragraph at the end of this step." />
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>
              Change the list numbering scheme.
            </h5>
            <p>
              Without changing the XHTML on the web page, add the CSS rules to make the nested lists between the first
              and second paragraph use lowercase latin letters (a, b, c, &hellip;) for the subitems, and lowercase
              roman numerals (<em>i, ii, iii, &hellip;</em>) for the sub-subitems:
            </p>
            <div>
              <img src="images/Figure_04.4.png" alt="Screenshot of nested lists with latin letters and roman numerals" />
            </div>
            <p>
              This procedure was covered in class. In case you missed it, here is how to apply the roman numerals to
              the doubly-nested list.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
ol ol ol {
  list-style-type:lower-roman;
}
            </div>
            <p>
              With that example to work from, you should be able to figure out how to do the singly-nested list.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Apply padding to all text elements.</h5>
            <p>
              To improve legibility, add one-half em of top and bottom padding and one em of left and right padding
              to all <span class="tag-name">h1</span>,
              <span class="tag-name">div</span>, and <span class="tag-name">p</span> elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add 1em of padding to all four sides of the <span class="tag-name">body</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Look at the page carefully to be sure the padding has pulled all the contents away from the edges of their
              containing boxes.
            </p>
            <div>
              <img src="images/Figure_04.5.png" alt="Screenshot of page with paddings added." />
            </div>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
