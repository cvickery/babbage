      	<h1>Reading Assignment</h1>
        <p>
          We are moving on from Chapter 3 to Chapter 4 of the textbook even though we have not covered forms and tables
          from Chapter 3 in our assignments yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will be using only some basic selectors and properties in this assignment, but you really need to read
          through all of Chapter 4 now rather than try to pick out just the bits and assignments needed for this
          assignment. See what’s there now, and you will be able to refer back to the various parts of the chapter as
          needed in the weeks to come.

        <h1>Coding Assignment</h1>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>Create a stylesheet.</h5>
            <p>
              If your <span class="directory-name">My Website</span> directory does not yet have a subdirectory, create
              it now. You can do this from within Dreamweaver: right-click on the “Site” line at the top of the files
              pane (which should be on the left side of the Dreamweaver window, assuming you have selected the “Coder”
                  or “Coder Plus” workspace layout from the Window menu); select New Folder from the drop-down menu, and
              then click twice on the “untitled” name and change it to <span class="directory-name">css</span>.
            </p>
            <p class="standout-block">
              Remember: capitalization will matter when I copy your site to babbage for grading. Be sure to use the same
              capitalization here and in the <span class="tag">link</span> element you write in the next step. The
              convention is to use lowercase, but that doesn’t matter as long as you are consistent.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now right-click on your <span class="directory-name">css</span> directory, and create a new file. Click on
              the name twice so you can edit it, and change the name to <span class="file-name">style.cc</span>. Edit
              the file and remove anything that Dreamweaver put in it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Link your stylesheet to your <span class="file-name">index.xhtml</span> page.</h5>
            <p>
              Add a (self-closing) <span class="tag">link</span> to <span class="file-name">index.xhtml</span>; set the
              <code>rel</code>, <code>type</code>, and <code>href</code> attributes to “stylesheet,” “text/css,” and
              “css/style.css” respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
              Add a rule to the stylesheet that causes all paragraphs to have red text as demonstrated in class:
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
p {
  color:red;
  }
            </div>
            <p>
              Test your code: be sure text in the paragraphs of your web page is all red. Click the CSS validation
              link at the bottom of the page, and be sure there are no errors or warnings. Fix whatever is wrong if
              there are problems.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Change the appearance of the page.</h5>
            <p>
              This is an exercise in following instructions as much as it is an exercise in using CSS. Pretend you are
              creating this web page for a client who is paying you to bring his or her vision to life. If you want to
              get paid, you have to resist the urge to do anything differently from what the client asked for.  Here are
              your client’s requirements:
            </p>
            <ul>
            	<li>
                Make the text all level-1 headings blue. Use the <span class="attribute-name">text-align</span>
                attribute to center the heading.
              </li>
              <li>
                Make all elements with the class “important” have the <span class="attribute-name">font-style</span>
                value <span class="attribute-value">italic</span>. Add the important class to the first and third
                paragraphs, and to the second item in your list.
              </li>
              <li>
              	Make all elements with the class “interesting” have green text. Add the interesting class to the
                third paragraph and to the first and second items in your list.
              </li>
              <li>
              	Make the element with the id “unique” display as bold (attribute 
                <span class="attribute-name">font-weight</span>) and blue. Give the second paragraph the “unique”
                id.
              </li>
              <li>
              	Set the left and right padding for all paragraphs to 1em; set the top and bottom padding to 0. (See
                pages 109 and 112 of the text.)
              </li>
              <li>
              	Set the <span class="property-name">display</span> property for all list items to "inline".
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
          	<h5>Check your work carefully.</h5>
            <p>
            	When you finish, your page should look pretty much like the screenshot below. Your actual text
              may differ from this, but the colors, fonts, and layout should be the same. If not, fix it!
            </p>
            <p>
              Be sure both validation links come up with no errors and no warnings, except for the one XHTML warning
              about that validator being experimental.
            </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Submit the Assignment</h1>
        <p>
          When your page is ready for me to review, send an email message to 
          <a href="mailto:Christopher.Vickery@qc.cuny.edu?subject=CS-081%20Assignment%204">
          Christopher.Vickery@qc.cuny.edu</a>
          with <span class="code-snippet">CS&#x2011;081&#160;Assignment&#160;4</span> as the Subject line.
          All you have to do is to put your name in the
          body of the message so that I know who sent the message. I will then copy your website from your profile on
          the server (oak) in the lab to the web server on babbage, where I will verify that it works correctly.
        </p>
        <ul class="standout-block">
          <li><span class=""></span>
            The web server on babbage is on a case-sensitive file system. That means that if you don't capitalize file
            and directory names exactly right, your site will no longer work when it is copied to babbage, even though
            it may have worked perfectly well in the lab, where the file system is case-insensitive. Be sure the name
            of you web page is <span class="filename">index.xhtml</span> using all lowercase letters.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your site will not be copied to the DocumentRoot on babbage, so any links with absolute pathnames (ones
            that start with a <code>/</code> character) will not work: make sure that all internal links in your site
            use relative, not absolute, pathnames. This is not an issue for this assignment (there are no internal links),
            but important to keep in mind for future assignments.
          </li>
