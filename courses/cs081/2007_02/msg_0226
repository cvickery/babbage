Dr. Xiang asked faculty to forward the following message to
all our students.  I have asked him why the MSDN offer
doesn't apply to students in the CIT minor and he is looking
into whether that is a real restriction or not.
Dr. Vickery

  1) Every student taking CS111 or higher can take advantage
  of our MSDN membership, which provides free download of XP
  Professional, Visual Studio .NET 2005 Professional, etc. 
  An eligible student should bring a photo ID to see Xiuyi
  in the department office. Upon confirmation of identity
  and eligibility, the student will be given a user-id (not
  easy to guess) for registration at the MSDN website:

  http://msdn04.e-academy.com/elms/Storefront/Home.aspx?campus=qccuny_comsci

  2) A talk on Vista by Gus Weber, Microsoft Academic
  Relations Manager for New York and Pennsylvania, is
  scheduled at 12:15- 1:15pm on Monday, 3/12 in C205.  It is
  an overview on the new OS followed by a deeper dive into
  its performance and security. Refreshments will be served.

  3) Every CS student is strongly urged to register his/her
  email at our department website http://www.cs.qc.cuny.edu
  under LISTSERVER on the left side of the homepage in order
  to receive important news such as 1 and 2 above.
