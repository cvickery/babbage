      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <div class="whitebox">
        <p>For this assignment you are to construct a web photo gallery. 
        The index page for your web site will contain a link to the index
        page of a subdirectory that will house the actual gallery. In the
        gallery, the index page will show a thumbnail-sized copy of each
        picture in the gallery, and clicking on the thumbnail will take the
        user to a separate page that will show the picture in its full size.
        Each of these pciture pages will have buttons for navigating to the
        next page in the gallery, the previous page, the thumbnail page, and
        the web site&rsquo;s home page.</p>
      </div>
      
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <div class="whitebox">
        <ol>
        
          <li>
          
            <h5>Collect the pictures for your gallery and prepare them for
            the web.</h5> <p class="runin">You may use any pictures you
            want, but I am providing you with <a href="images/">a set of my
            pictures</a> that you can pick from if you want to use them
            instead of or in addition to your own.  The pictures you use,
            including the ones I provide, will undoubtedly vary
            significantly in terms of file size, image size, file type, and
            resolution.  You need to process each one to produce two copies:
            a small version for use as a thumbnail, and a larger version for
            display on the individual web pages.  Dreamweaver comes with an
            auxiliary program called <span
            class="programName">Fireworks</span> that you can use to do this
            processing.  If you have a copy of <span
            class="programName">Photoshop</span> available to you, you can
            use its auxiliary program, <span
            class="programName">ImageReady</span>, which works very much the
            same way as <span class="programName">Fireworks</span>.</p>
            
            <p class="standoutBox">I am supplying images in three formats:
            <span class="techTerm"
            title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">
            JPEG</span> pictures, <span class="techTerm"
            title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</span> images, and <span
            class="techTerm" title="Shockwave Flash">SWF</span> (Flash)
            movies.  JPEGs and PNGs can be displayed using <span
            class="tagName">img</span> tags, but Flash movies are shown
            using <span class="tagName">object</span> tags.  Displaying
            Flash movies in this project is optional.</p>
            
            <p>When you process your images you need to reduce the file size
            as much as possible without losing image quality, and have to
            make some decisions about how they fit in browser windows. 
            There is no &ldquo;correct&rdquo; way to display pictures on the
            web, in part because you have no way of knowing the size or
            <span class="techTerm" title="width divided by height">aspect
            ratio</span> of a user&rsquo;s browser window.</p>

            <p>So, somewhat arbitrarily, here are the parameters to follow
            when processing your images: each image must fit inside a
            rectangular canvas exactly 900 pixels wide and 556 pixels high.
            These dimensions have an aspect ratio approximating the <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio"
title="a relationship between height and width known to be visually pleasing">
            golden ratio</a> and take advantage of reasonably large browser
            window sizes.  We are explicitly constraining the images to fit
            in a rectangle with landscape (horizontal) orientation rather
            than portrait because that&rsquo;s the way (most) computer
            monitors are oriented; if an image is more vertical than
            horizontal, constrain its height to 742 pixels.  If an image is
            smaller than the canvas, do not make it larger (that would
            degrade the quality of the image), just center it in the
            canvas.</p>

            <p>For the thumbnails, follow the same procedure as you do for
            the full sized images, but make the canvas size 100&times;100
            pixels.  Be sure you don&rsquo;t overwrite your images when you
            save the thumbnails!  Either put the thumbnails in a
            subdirectory of your <span class="directoryName">images</span>
            folder, named <span class="directoryName">thumbnails</span>, or
            give them special names, like <span
            class="fileName">peaches-thumb.jpg</span> for the <span
            class="fileName">peaches.jpg</span> image.</p>

            <p class="standoutBox">Set up just 2-3 images to start with. 
            Then, after you have the gallery set up and see that the above
            settings work all right, you can process more images the same
            way and add them to your gallery.  This way if something needs
            to be changed you will not lose a lot of time re-processing all
            your images.</p>

          </li>
          
          <li>
          
            <h5>Create the photo gallery directory, add a link to it in your
            home page, and add the thumbnails to the gallery index
            page.</h5> <p class="runin">Create a subdirectory of <span
            class="directoryName">My Web Pages</span> with a meaningful name
            of your choice, such as <span class="directoryName">Picture
            Gallery</span>.  In Dreamweaver, create the index page for your
            gallery using the <span class="menuItem">File->New</span> menu
            item to create a new page based on your course web page
            template.</p>

            <p>Make the <span class="tagName">title</span> and <span
            class="tagName">h1</span> heading for the gallery index page
            into something clever and meaningful, such as &ldquo;Picture
            Gallery.&rdquo;  Replace the <span class="tagName">h2</span> in
            the content section with an <span class="tagName">img</span> tag
            for each of the thumbnails you have prepared so far.  The <span
            class="tagName">img</span> tags must have both src and alt
            attributes, and do not need <span
            class="attributeName">height</span> or <span
            class="attributeName">width</span> attributes.  You should add
            <span class="attributeName">title</span> attributes to them; see
            below for more information on this.</p>

            <p>Make the footer <span class="tagName">div</span> contain
            exactly three links: a link to your site&rsquo;s home page, and
            the two links for validating XHTML and CSS for the page.</p>
            
            <p class="standoutBox">Do not worry about formatting this page
            carefully yet.  The first goal is to get the gallery structure
            and content set up and working.</p>

            <p>Test your project so far: You should be able to click on a
            link on the home page to get to the gallery, and you should be
            able to click on the link at the bottom of the gallery index to
            get back to the home page.  Both the home page and the gallery
            index page should pass W3C validation with no errors or warnings
            for XHTML and CSS.  The gallery index should show the thumbnails
            you set up in a row.</p>

          </li>
          
          <li>
          
            <h5>Set up gallery image pages and link to them from the gallery
            index page.</h5> <p class="runin">Create a web page based on
            your course template for one of the pictures you have prepared
            for your gallery.  Change the title and <span
            class="tagName">h1</span> heading to match the name of the
            picture, and replace the contents of the content <span
            class="tagName">div</span> with an <span
            class="tagName">img</span> for the full-sized image you
            prepared.  Put three links in the footer <span
            class="tagName">div</span>with contents of &ldquo;Previous,
            &rdquo;&ldquo;Index,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Next.&rdquo;  The middle
            link goes to the gallery index page, but for now the other two
            should point nowhere.  (The url for &ldquo;nowhere&rdquo; is
            <span class="codeSnippet">"#"</span> .)  Put these
            navigation links in a separate <span class="tagName">div</span>
            from the two validation links so they will be able to be styled
            differently later on.
            Save this web page in your gallery directory using the name of
            the photo.  For example, the image page for <span
            class="fileName">peaches.jpg</span> should be <span
            class="fileName">peaches.xhtml</span>.</p>

            <p>Now go back to the gallery index page, and surround the <span
            class="tagName">img</span> tag for the first picture with a link
            to the picture&rsquo;s image page that you just prepared.  Check
            the site in a browser to be sure all the links you have set up
            so far work.  At this point set up the <span
            class="attributeName">title</span> attribute of the image with a
            title for the picture so the user will see it when they hover
            over the link.  Since the image tag and the link tag occupy the
            same box on the page, you could put the <span
            class="attributeName">title</span> attribute on either one. 
            (What happens if you put a different title on both?)</p>

            <p>Generate image pages for the other pictures you have prepared
            so far.  Rather than start fresh from your Dreamweaver template
            for each one, it is all right to copy the first image file you
            prepared and then to edit the copies so they have the correct
            <span class="tagName">title</span> and <span
            class="tagName">h1</span> tags and the correct <span
            class="attributeName">src</span> and <span
            class="attributeName">alt</span> values for the <span
            class="tagName">img</span> tag.  Fix up the <span
            class="variableName">Previous</span> and <span
            class="variableName">Next</span> links on each image page so the
            images create a cycle that matches the order of the index page
            thumnails.  The next image after the last is the first and the
            previous one before the first is the last.</p>

            <p>Test the gallery carefully.  Be sure the correct picture
            shows up in each image page, that each image page links properly
            to the previous and next one in the cycle, and to the index page
            for the gallery.  Be sure each image page validates
            completely.  Note that the image pages all lay out the same
            regardless of the actual picture dimensions because of the way
            the images were processed; you should not have to move the mouse
            at all to click the Next link for each image, and likewise for
            the Previous links.</p>

          </li>
          
          <li>
          
            <h5>Pick a color scheme for your gallery and prepare more
            images.</h5> <p class="runin">When you created the matte for
            your pictures, you probably used the default color: white.  And
            you have had a chance to see your matted pictures against your
            site template&rsquo;s default background color.  Decide what
            kind of background you want to use for presenting your
            pictures.  Some common choices are black, white and gray, and
            pastels can sometimes be used too.  But avoid saturated colors,
            because it is likely to affect how the pictures appear.  We are
            going to design the gallery so the matte blends in with the page
            background, so pick a background color now and process all your
            images so they have that color matte.  Your thumbnails may have
            a matte color that either matches or complements the background
            color you choose for the gallery index page.</p>
            
            <p>Add a picture_gallery.css style sheet to your site&rsquo;s
            <span class="folderName">css</span> directory and set the <span
            class="tagName">html</span> and <span
            class="tagName">body</span> <span
            class="attributeName">background-color</span> and <span
            class="attributeName">color</span> properties to your chosen
            color scheme.  Add a link to this style sheet after the link to
            the site&rsquo;s main style sheet so you can override the
            default colors for the site for just those pages inside the
            gallery.</p>

            <p>Update your gallery so there are several pictures, at least
            twelve.  <strong>If you do not want to process so many images in
            Fireworks, it is all right to have just 4-5 different images and
            to add numbers to their names.  So you could have an image file
            named <span class="fileName">peaches-1.jpg</span> that is
            simply  a copy of  <span
            class="fileName">peaches.jpg</span></strong> But each copy has
            to have its own image page and own thumbnail.  Make sure all the
            links on all the image pages work.  Observe what happens when
            you resize the browser window on both the index page and on the
            image pages.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
          
            <h5>Style The Picture Pages</h5>
            <p class="runin">For this part of the assignment, you are to
            create a design for the picture pages that meets the following
            requirements:</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>The name of the picture appears at the top.</li>
              <li>The previous, index, and navigation links are to be
              centered on the page, and must use the same size or slightly
              smaller font as the picture title.</li>
              <li>The links to the W3.org validators must be about half the
              size of the navigation links, and must appear centered below
              them.</li>
              <li>The image must be centered in the window, and must change
              size to match the size of the browser&rsquo;s <span
              class="techTerm"
      title="The part of the browser window where the page is displayed/">
              viewport</span>.</li>
              <li>There must be a background border for image part of the
              page that includes gradient effects.</li>
              <li>There image pages must render correctly in the four major
              browsers (<span class="programName">Internet Explorer</span>,
              <span class="programName">Firefox</span>, <span
              class="programName">Opera</span>, and <span
              class="programName">Safari</span>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here is a screenshot of one design that meets these
            requirements:</p>
            
            <p class="center"><img src="picture_frame_screenshot.jpg"
            alt="Screenshot of an image page" /></p>
            
            <p>Working through the various aspects of this part of the
            assignment requires a bit of work ... and experimentation.  The
            <a href="../framed_picture.xhtml">second web page for this
            assignment</a> will guide you through the process.</p>
