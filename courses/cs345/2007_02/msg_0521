  I've been getting questions from people as they study for
  Tuesday's exam, and rather than answer each one
  separately, I am answering them on the course Discussion
  Board.  In case you don't remember, there a link to the
  discussion board on the course web page; the username and
  password for reading things on the board are
  'vickery-student' and 'forum'.  You can read messages on
  the forum using just those credentials, but to post to the
  forum you have to register for it using the Register
  button near the top.

  So far there is a question about video/audio timing, which
  I have posted an answer to.
