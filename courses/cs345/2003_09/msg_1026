Two things --

  1.  If you haven't submitted a project proposal yet, please contact
  me so we can start to make plans on that front.

  2.  We've enabled Remote Desktop on all the computers in the lab so
  you can access the DK software from off campus.  Remote Desktop
  comes with Windows XP; it's under Accessories->Communications from
  the Start Menu.  Only one person can use a computer at a time,
  either a local user or a remote desktop user, but not both at the
  same time.  When you finish a remote desktop connection, be sure to
  _log off_ the computer rather than just "disconnect" from it.  If
  you only disconnect, your login session continues to lock the
  computer, preventing anyone else from using that machine even though
  you are finished with it.  If you aren't running Windows XP and want
  to access the machines from off campus, there is a somewhat less
  convenient mechanism called VNC that we can configure for you to
  use; there are VNC viewer programs for Windows and Unix/Linux, but
  not the Macintosh (although you might be able build a copy from
  sources for OS-X).  Let me know if you are interested in using VNC
  and/or have trouble with Remote Desktop.
