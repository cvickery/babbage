I'm broadcasting this to everyone in the Hardware Lab course ...

OIT is looking for someone to work part time as a Unix systems
administrator.  The job description is below.  If you are interested,
or know someone else who might be interested, you/they may contact
Eric Shamow directly: eric@qc.edu.

Dr. Vickery


JOB OPENING:
Assistant Systems Manager.

Job entails:

1. Installing, configuring and maintaining software (new compilers,
database programs, Web utilities, etc.).

2. Writing small programs and scripts to support users needs and to make
their lives easier.

3. Writing web applications to provide a user front-end to system 
operations.
PHP knowledge is a plus.

4. Answering system related questions from users (the Help Desk is
responsible for answering basic questions).

5. Writing some documentation and/or giving instructional seminars to
users.

Job Requirements:

Someone not currently in their graduating year.

Ability to do C/C++ programming.

Firm knowledge of Internet utilities (FTP, Telnet, Usenet, E-mail, & WWW).

Knowledge of UNIX or Linux (must know basic Unix command set, be able to 
write
UNIX scripts).

A Computer Science major is preferred.

Hours:
20 hours a week, starting ASAP.  Scheduling is generally flexible except
that there is some systems work that can only be done when the system is
not up.  This requires, occasionally, working late on Friday night,
past midnight.  Candidates for this job should either live within
walking distance of the College or must have a car.

Don't be intimidated if you don't meet every single one of the job
requirements.  This is a wish list and I realize that some training will
be involved.

Thank you for your interest.
