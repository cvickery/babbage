  1.  I've reworked the course web page so it should be a bit easier
  to navigate.  There is a section of sample code there now that
  includes my solutions to lab assignments as well as some
  demonstrations on using Audio Out, etc.

  2.  Koya Matsuo has reconfigured the computers a bit to try to
  reduce problems with "roaming profiles."  As you know, all your work
  (your "profile" as Microsoft likes to call it) is kept on Maple, is
  copied over to the C: drive of whatever computer you log into, and
  then copied back to Maple when you finish.  Sometimes there are
  delays when logging in because of problems getting your info from
  Maple, and sometimes the whole process fails and you get a cached
  copy of your work from the last time you were using that PC.  To
  simplify things, Koya has turned off the option to use a cashed copy
  of your profile, which may have been causing some of the problems.
  And if your computer can't get your profile from Maple it now won't
  let you log on.  If you cannot log on, it's okay to reboot the
  offending computer to (try to) clear up the problem.  Please let
  Koya and/or me know if you continue to have problems logging in.

  3.  Reminder:  If you use Remote Desktop to log into one of the tree
  computers from elsewhere, be sure you _logoff_ the computer when
  you finish your session rather than just _disconnecting_.  To get to
  the logoff option using Remote Desktop you have to type Ctrl-Alt-End
  instead of Ctrl-Alt-Del.

  4.  Exciting news!!!  Xilinx just sent us updated versions of all
  their software.  It's exciting because installing it will probably
  break everything we've been doing ... stay tuned for further
  developments.
