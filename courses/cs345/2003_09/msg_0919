
  Many people were frustrated by Wednesday's lab session, for which
  I apologize.  To try to make things a little better, I have
  rewritten the lab handout; you can get a fresh copy now from the web
  page for the course.  If you have already finished your work on the
  lab there is no need to redo anything.  I will accept your report
  based on the original version of the handout.  But you might get a
  better idea of what the laboratory was intended to cover by looking
  at the new version of the handout anyway.  If you haven't finished
  doing the lab yet, feel free to intermix the original handout with
  the revised one in any way you find convenient.  Again, I think you
  will find the revised handout to be a bit clearer than the original,
  and worth looking at.

  And there is some good news on the physical discomfort front:
  yesterday we took the tops off the workbenches in the lab and the
  monitors are now down at eye level.  The keyboards are still too
  high, but there's no easy way I know of to lower the table tops!

  If you spot any errors in the new lab handout, let me know and I'll
  fix them.

  Have a good weekend,
  Dr. Vickery
