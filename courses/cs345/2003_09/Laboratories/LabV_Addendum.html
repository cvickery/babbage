<h1>Wave Analyzer Addendum</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The handout for Laboratory V introduced the DK Waveform Analyzer,
  but it omitted the step of actually using the Waveform Analyzer to
  trace the output of your servomotor controller, having you verify
  your circuit only using an oscilloscope instead.  This supplement
  shows you how you can set up your Handel-C code so you can test your
  motor controller using the Waveform Analyzer during simulation if you
  want to.</p>

<h2>Project Setup</h2>

  <p>You need to configure the project for both Simulation (Debug) and
  EDIF (RC200E) in the usual way.  This document assumes you define the
  preprocessor symbols USE_SIM and either USE_RC200 or USE_RC200E for
  compatibility with the PAL.</p>

<h2>Conditional Source Code</h2>

  <p>You need to make several changes to your source code to accommodate
  the differences between simulation and EDIF configurations: Clock
  specification, PAL switch numbers, and the output interface.</p>

  <h3>Clock Specification</h3>
  
    <p>You can use any one of the three RC200E hardware clocks as the
    PAL_TARGET_CLOCK_RATE rate when generating EDIF, but you can save run
    time by specifying a slower value when simulating.  However,
    because of the <i>microsecond_delay()</i> macro proc, the slowest
    value you can use meaningfully is 1MHz so that the expression
    PAL_ACTUAL_CLOCK_RATE&nbsp;/&nbsp;1000000 doesn't go to zero.</p>
    
    <p>An issue when simulating for use with the Waveform Analyzer is
    that the (simulated) clock must be output to the Analyzer so it can
    synchronize with the Handel-C program as the simulation runs.  As
    seen in the example from the Waveform Analyzer Manual, the simulator
    and Analyzer clocks can be synchronized by including a <i>set
    clock</i> statement in the Handel-C program, and by adding tags to
    the statement using a <i>with</i> block.  (See page 209 of the
    Handel-C Reference Manual for a discussion of where <i>with</i>
    blocks are used.)  But you can't have both a set clock statement and
    a definition of PAL_TARGET_CLOCK_RATE in effect when you #include
    pal_master.hch.  The trick here is to specify the
    PAL_ACTUAL_CLOCK_RATE when simulating.</p>
    
    <p>The reason for including pal_master.hch is so we can use the
    simulated switches of the PAL Virtual Console while testing the
    program, which leads back to an issue discussed earlier this
    semester: The RC200E switches are numbers 0 and 1, but the PAL
    Virtual Console's switches number 8 and 9 are more appropriate for
    the way we are using the buttons.  All together, we end up with
    initial code that looks something like this:</p>
    
    <div class="white"><pre>

    #if (defined USE_RC200 || USE_RC200E)
    #define PAL_TARGET_CLOCK_RATE 50000000
    #define SW0 0
    #define SW1 1
    #define NUM_SWITCHES 2
    #else
    #define PAL_ACTUAL_CLOCK_RATE 1000000
    set clock = external "P1"
      with
      {
        extlib  = "DKSync.dll",
        extinst = "1000",       // Period of 1MHz simulated clock
        extfunc = "DKSyncGetSet"
      };
    #define SW0 8
    #define SW1 9
    #define NUM_SWITCHES 10
    #endif
    #include <pal_master.hch>
    </pre></div>

    <h3>Connecting the Output</h3>
    
    <p>The output of the program is to be connected to pin 3 of the
    expansion header when generating EDIF, but has to be connected to a
    "terminal" in order to monitor it with the Waveform Analyzer.  The
    following conditional code takes care of that:</p>
    
    <div class="white"><pre>
    unsigned 1 motor_pin = 0;
    interface bus_out() motor( unsigned 1 out = motor_pin )
      with
      {
    #if (defined USE_RC200 || USE_RC200E)
        data  = { "M2" }
    #else
        extlib  = "DKConnect.dll",
        extinst = "t(1)",
        extfunc = "DKConnectGetSet"
    #endif
      };
    </pre></div>

<h2>Setting Up the Waveform Analyzer</h2>

  <p>The trick here is to get the Waveform Analyzer to give you
  meaningful time intervals.  Since the Handel-C simulation is using a
  1MHz clock, specify 1000 for the Waveform Analyzer's clock period, the
  same value used for the extinst parameter of the set clock's
  <i>with</i> block.  The number is specified in nanoseconds, as
  mentioned on page 6 of the Waveform Analyzer Manual.  You can take as
  many samples with the Waveform Analyzer as you wish.  If you collect
  20,000, your trace will show 20,000 * 1,000 nanoseconds of simulated
  time (20,000,000 nsec = 20 msec, the interval between pulses that your
  code is to generate).  If you collect 40,000 samples, you should see
  two pulses at a time in the Waveform Analyzer's trace window; collect
  10,000, and you will see one pulse on every other sweep (by the dashed
  red line) of the trace window.  If you make the number of samples a
  multiple of 20,000, the pulses you see will appear to be stationary in
  the trace window, but if you make the number of samples not be a
  multiple, the pulses will move around in the trace window on
  successive sweeps, making it hard to validate that your code is
  working correctly.</p>
  
  <p>With everything set up correctly, you should be able to start your
  simulation in the usual way from the DK GUI, and you should be able to
  operate switches 8 and 9 in the PAL console.  At any time, you can
  start the Waveform Analyzer, and it will display the motor output as
  the simulated value changes.  You can use Waveform Analyzer cursors to
  mark the beginning and ends of the pulses to verify that they are of
  the correct width as you operate the virtual switches.</p>
  
  <p>The following screen shot shows the Waveform Analyzer with cursors
  set to the beginning of the pulses and lined up with where the pulses
  ended when different combinations of input switches were on.  I've
  zoomed in on the pulse so there is enough room to read the time
  intervals between the cursors.  Note that these intervals are not
  perfectly accurate because the screen resolution prevents placing the
  cursors in perfect alignment with the edges of the pulses.</p>
