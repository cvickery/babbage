First of all, a student in the class stopped by the main
gate last evening and confirmed that they now have a copy of
the new key for A-205 there, so there should be no problem
getting access to the computers this weekend.  If you do
have a problem, send me email right away and I'll see if
there is anything I can do about it.

I've now taken to putting the date and time on the bottom of
each page of the lab assignments so you can figure out which
version to throw away.  The version on the web now has some
clarifications added to the last version that I printed out
for everyone last evening.

I think almost everyone got the blinking LEDs code to
download and run properly in the lab, which leaves the
up-down counter to do for next week.  Once you have that
working in simulation, downloading it to the RC-200 should
be straightforward, and can be done in the lab Wednesday
evening before submitting your code listings.  Some people
were concerned about not having access to the RC-200s over
the weekend, and I think that at least for this week it
shouldn't be a problem.
