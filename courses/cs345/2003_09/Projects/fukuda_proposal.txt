Project goal:

   Reads the input signal from either SRF08

   ultrasenso
or camera input, and compute
    the edge.
Further
Project goal two:
   Stereoscopic display of that object.






Ultrasonic sensor implements shape recognition A Genetic Algorithm.
This project uses an ultrasonic  device  for  recognition  using
ultrasound pressure data and a Genetic Algorithm.
Technique to Vision with ultrasonic sensors are often used for shape
recognition in situations in which optical sensors cannot be used,
such as in dark environments or under water. In the field of shape
recognition, several recognition methods have been proposed which use
a neural network (NN) based on the image range determined by time of
flight, holographic image, and ultrasound pressure data which are acquired
using an ultrasonic sensor array.
Goal of this project is to implement the preproposed method in
Hardware development environment with Xillinx FPGA to optimize the
computation.


Programming task:
   - Phase 0
       Build the head which SRF08 is going to be attached and
       control the movement programatically.
   - Phase 1
       Reading ultrasound signal and processing it or using dataset
   - Phase 2
       Apply the Genetic Algorithm to recognize the 3D Shape
   - Phase 3 ( if time allowed )
       Displaying on the LCD with Stereoscopic view.
