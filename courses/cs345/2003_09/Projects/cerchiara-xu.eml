We plan to make the video game nibbles, the game where a snake eats and gets
longer.  We plan to use the touch screen and hopefully implement the sounds
on the FPGA.  The touch screen for the control of the snake and the sounds
for everytime the snake hits a wall or gets something to eat to get longer.
