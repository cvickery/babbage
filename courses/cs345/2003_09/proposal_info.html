<h1>Proposal Requirements</h1>
</center>

  <p>Here is a copy of the email about project proposals that I sent to
  everyone on October 16:</p>

<pre>
Your group is to submit a written project proposal by 
Wednesday the 22nd that consists of the following information:

  * Title
  * Names of group members
  * Description of what the completed project will be/do.  This
    is to be a brief, just a sentence or two.
  * Rationale for the project.  Tell why this seems like an
    project to implement on the RC200E.  Be sure to mention what
    features of the RC200E your project will make use of.
  * Development plan.  This is just a list of the subgoals you 
    plan to go through to complete the project.  For example,
    "Learn how to read an image from the camera" might be one of
    the subgoals of an image processing project.  Try to arrange
    these subgoals in a logical order, and tell how they might be
    partitioned among the members of the group to facilitate
    parallel development effort.

Don't agonize over this document; this one is only a draft.  I'll
comment on it and give you feedback to help you come up with a
good plan.  If you are not sure exactly what you want to do, you
can just tell what sort of thing sounds interesting and/or ask
questions here.  You may submit your plan early and I will give
you my feedback as quickly as I can.  The idea is to get started
on this so you can get to work on the project as soon as
possible.
My plan is to stop assigning laboratory exercises and to devote
all lab time to your work on your projects for the remainder of
the semester.  I'll be checking your progress each week.

Here are some features of the RC-200E we haven't explored yet, any
of which might be useful and/or interesting as you think about
what you will be doing:

  * Touchscreen and mouse input
  * Audio and Video I/O
  * Bluetooth
  * Ethernet
  * SmartMedia I/O
  * 8 MB of RAM
  * RS-232 Interface (modem/terminal connection)
  * Microprocessor (we are licensed to use Xilinx' "MicroBlaze"
    CPU, which is an entire 32-bit RISC CPU that can be loaded
    into the FPGA and runs programs written in C.  Interfacing
    some of the RC200E peripherals to this CPU would be an
    "interesting" project.
