  The laboratory will be open Monday afternoon and evening for
  anyone who wants to use the kits.  I won't be able to stay
  after 6:00, but you can leave the kits in the lab when you
  leave, and the last person out will be responsible for making
  sure the door is closed when they leave.

  To make this work, the lab must never be left open with no one
  in it.  If you are the only person in the lab and have to
  leave, you must lock it behind you.  The other side of this is
  that you must not leave anything in the lab if you leave for a
  while; even though people are there when you step out, they
  might all leave while you are gone ... and lock you out.
