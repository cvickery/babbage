The message below is pretty self-explanatory.  If it's possible for
you to work on your lab assignment tomorrow in the middle of the day,
it looks like it could help the college in its effort to obtain some
funding.

  Subject: State visit on Friday

  Dear All:

  The state is paying a surprise visit to the science building tomorrow 
  (Friday) to see how much activity we have in our labs. This is in part 
  to judge the need for new lab space for the sciences. I know many of us 
  are at the grad center tomorrow, but if possible try to rally 
  student/faculty activity in the following labs: A205, A 219 and A 223. 
  The dean has asked us to keep active between the hours of 10am and 2pm.

  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated. The president is 
  trying to get extra funding from the state.

  Thanks

  Jenny
