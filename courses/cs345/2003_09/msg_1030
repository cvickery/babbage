  This is to let you know that I've finally gotten a chance to check
  off the lab assignments I've received so far.  I set up a web page
  you can use to check that I have recorded everything accurately for
  you.  Let me know if you submitted something and it's not recorded
  yet.  There is a link to the "Check Grades" web page on the course
  web page.

  Here is an explanation of the information you will see:

    Labs 1 and 2 are generally either "ok" or '--'.  If you
    got a '--' even though you submitted the report for the
    lab, let me know.

    For labs 3-5, you were both to submit "code" and to show
    me your assignment working on an RC200 to "check."  So
    there are "code" and "check" rows for each of those
    labs.

    If your project proposal was approved, the Proposal row
    will say "approved."  If it needs to be revised, that
    row will say "revise".  And I've given a one work name
    to your project, which is listed too.

  My apologies if you submitted anything or had anything
  checked off and it isn't on the web page.  Let me know and
  I'll fix it up.
