<h1>CS-345 Final Project Guidelines</h1>
</center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="whitebox">

  <p>Once you have completed the structured laboratory assignments for
  the course, you are to use your experience with the laboratory
  environment to design and build your own final project for the
  course.  The project doesn't have to be big and complex.  After all,
  there are only a few weeks available for completing it.  But it
  should take the experience you've developed in the structured
  laboratories to "the next level" in some way.  Perhaps you would like
  to elaborate on one of the structured labs in an interesting way, or
  perhaps you'd like to work with one of the interfaces not covered in
  the structured labs.  The choice is up to you.</p>
  
  <p>This guideline gives you some ideas of the parameters and
  requirements for doing your project.</p>

</div>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<div class="whitebox">

  <p>You may work in a group or individually, as you prefer.  But if you
  are going to work in a group, make sure everyone in the group is
  seriously "signed on to the project."  It's just not fair to others if
  you say you are going to work on a project and then don't pull your
  weight.  It would be better to take on a small project of your own
  than to agree to help out on a group project and then to let the team
  down by not contributing fully.  Despite that last sentence, there is
  no requirement that group projects be "big" to justify having multiple
  people working on them.  Grades will not depend on group size.</p>
  
  <p>There will be a final report for the project, written according to
  the <a href="./Lab_Report_Guidelines.pdf">Lab Report Guidelines</a>
  for the course.  All code is to be structured and documented in
  accordance with the <a href="./Coding_Guidelines.php">Coding
  Guidelines</a> for the course.</p>
  
  <p>Instead of a final exam for the course, the class will meet at the
  scheduled time for the final exam in SB A-205, for presentations of
  the projects.  There will be about 15 minutes for each project and
  part of the project grade will depend on the quality of the
  presentation.  The presentation consists essentially of the contents
  of the Laboratory Report:  Introduce the rationale for the project,
  describe the Methodology used to implement the project, tell the
  Results obtained, and finally, Discuss the project's significance,
  successes, and/or failures.  Provide a live demonstration of the
  project during the Results part of the presentation.  A projector will
  be available for showing the RC-200E LCD display and/or
  PowerPoint-type slides.</p>
  
  <p>You <i>must</i> submit a description of your project to me by email
  and receive my approval for it before starting to work on it.  If you
  are not sure exactly what you want to do, just give me an idea of the
  general thoughts you have, and we'll pin it down iteratively.  The
  idea is to make sure your idea is appropriate for the RC200E and can
  realistically be done in the time available.</p>
  
  <p>As you think about your project, remember that the RC200E is a
  student laboratory platform designed to provide you with a chance to
  learn how build interfaces between logic functions and various
  peripheral devices.  If you try to build a radio controlled airplane
  using the RC-200E, it probably won't fly.  But if you wanted to mimic
  the functionality of an airplane controller using the touchscreen to
  control servomotors, you could do it.</p>
  
  <p>Remember, there is no CPU on the RC-200E, only (a lot of) gates and
  flip-flops.  So if you try a project that is software intensive you
  will have less chance of success than if you tackle something that
  concentrates on hardware interfaces.  File I/O, for example, is going
  to be a problem.  Despite the graphical features of the
  touchscreen/LCD, an interactive drawing program is going to be a
  problem.  On the other hand, it's perfectly all right to have a
  software component of the project that runs on the PC and communicates
  with the RC-200 through the serial or Ethernet ports.</p>

  <p>Finally, here are some project ideas, along with comments about
  what people have done in the past:</p>
  
  <ol>
      <li>Bluetooth!  Nobody's gotten this to work yet.  The Bluetooth
      protocol stack is very deep and complex.  On the other hand, there
      is more documentation available now than previously, and it's
      <i>possible</i> somebody could pull it off.</li>
      
      <li>SmartMedia!  Another device that's caused more problems than
      one might expect.  It's not easy to read and write this device. 
      It can be done, but be aware that if you want to work with a file
      that was prepared on a PC, it's a piece of work to get it onto a
      SmartMedia card and from there into the RC-200E.</li>
      
      <li>Ethernet.  There have been several projects that were
      successful in getting Ethernet communcation going, even to the
      point of transmitting audio and/or video from one device to the
      other.  But it's a challenge.</li>
      
      <li>Audio.  There are numerous options here, both for input
      (microphone or line in) and output (headphones or speakers). 
      Voice over Ethernet has worked, and there are a number of
      interesting "digital signal processing" (dsp) algorithms that
      could be developed.  If you know what an FFT is, you might be
      interested in something along those lines.</li>
      
      <li>Video.  Surprisingly difficult to get "right," but possible
      nonetheless.  Students have been able to transmit video over the
      Ethernet at about 15 frames per second.  Can you do better?</li>
      
      <li>Stepper motor controller.  If you have any electronics
      background, this could be interesting.  Unlike a servomotor, a
      stepper motor moves a fixed amount each time it receives a pulse,
      making it ideal for robots, plotters, and other devices that need
      precise control over the amount of movement.  We have some motors,
      but have not yet built the electronic interface between them and
      the FPGA pins.</li>
      
      <li>Games.  People have successfully built classic video games,
      like "Snakes" and others like tic-tac-toe using the
      touchscreen/LCD.  But make sure there's not too much video
      processing involved.</li>
      
      <li>Piano keyboard.  One project in the past made a nice piano
      interface, but was limited by the fact that the touchscreen will
      register only one point at a time.  Try to play a chord, and you
      get the average position on the screen of all points touched
      simultaneously.  Take this into consideration for any sort of
      touchscreen application.</li>
      
      <li>Novel ideas welcome!</li>
  
  </ol>
