  Guidelines for the course?

    Use styles for the title and headings.

    past tense.
    
    The Method section is where you would mention the pulse widths
    generated; the Results section is where you would tell whether you
    observed the desired pulse widths when simulating, when using the
    oscilloscope, and whether the servomotor worked or not.  You should
    reference the programs by name and refer to the appropriate
    appendices in this section.

    The Results section only talks about "the program."  Which one are
    you talking about?  (You should talk about all of them.)

    Note the new report guidelines, which call for each code listing to
    start on a new page and for you to include workspace and project
    files in the future.

  4.5/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?
