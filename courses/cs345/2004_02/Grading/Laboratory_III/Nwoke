  This is your grading report for Laboratory III.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Remember to use your word processor's styles for the title and
    section headings.

    Proofread!  The very first sentence is missing a "to".  The next
    sentence starts with "One" instead of "On" ...  This pattern
    continues to the last sentence of the Results (... the motor responded
    are expected ...).

    Use the past tense for everything.  This is a report of what you
    did, not what you were assigned to do or are going to do.  For
    example, start the Method section with "I created a workspace ...".

    Refer to the code listings in the appendices from the Method
    section.

    Note the new report guidelines, which call for you to include
    workspace and project files as additional appendices in the future.

  4.8/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Include a comment block at the beginning of each file giving a
    summary of the file's contents, and includes your name, affiliation,
    and when the code was written.
    
    Otherwise, good.

  9.3/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
