  This is your grading report for Laboratory III.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Your Introduction is more like an Abstract.  You can skip the
    Abstract (which summarizes what you did) and just write an
    Introduction, which gives the motivation for the assignment and
    relates it to whatever else might seem important.

    Include all articles in your sentences.  Include all subjects. 
    "Created a workspace ..." should be "I created a workspace ..." 
    "Waveform Analyzer ... verified ..." should be something like, "The
    Waveform Analyzer ...." or "Using the Waveform Analyzer ...".

  4.9.0/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    It would make more sense to use a switch statement to handle the
    four cases for various combinations of the two switches pressed or
    not, rather than nested if-then-elses, which can be difficult to
    follow.

    The source code hyperlinks don't really help, since the code goes
    through your viewcpp script and the browser's renderer before I get
    to look at it.  In your case, this is a minor issue at most; you can
    just submit the pdfs and not worry about it.
    
    Note the new report guidelines, which call for each code listing to
    start on a new page and for you to include workspace and project
    files in the future.

  9.4/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
