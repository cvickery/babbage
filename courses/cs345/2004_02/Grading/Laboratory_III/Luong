  4.7/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    You mixed tenses.  The Method section starts out in the past tense
    and moves to the future.  Keep it all in the past tense; this is a
    report of what you did, not what you are going to do.

    In the Method section, mention the names of the programs, and refer
    to the appropriate program listings in the appendices.

    In general, though, the Method section is very well written.

    Reminder: Use monospaced font for code listings; use page breaks
    rather than blank lines to start listings on new pages.  And please
    tell your word processor to single space the code listings to make
    them easier to read (for me, at least).  You can single space the
    report body, too, if you want to; but that's optional.

    Note the new report guidelines, which call for you to include
    workspace and project files in the future.

  4.8/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Use a switch statement for handling the four possible settings of
    the switches rather than nested if-elses.  It's clearer to read, and
    helps make sure you've covered all four cases fully.

  9.5/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
