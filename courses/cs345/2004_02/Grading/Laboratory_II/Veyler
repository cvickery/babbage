  This is your grading report for Laboratory II.

  Dr. Vickery


  3.0/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Use the Heading 2 style for the subheadings, as specified in the Lab
    Report Guidelines.

    The Introduction consist of incomplete sentences with nonstandard
    punctuation.  For example, the parts are identified as "(a)" and
    "(b)" but these markers are put at the end of the list items instead
    of at the beginnings.

    The code actually isn't "self explanatory."  Even if it were, saying
    it is would not constitute a desription of the methodology.  Use
    sentences to describe the algorithms implemented.

    The last section is called "Appendices," not "Index."
    Use meaningful names for the files.

  3.0/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Your code is not documented!

    Indentation has to be done with spaces to make it legible.  Some of
    your code is indented using word processor margin settings, and some
    is indented using tabs.  Just set the editor to expand tabs into
    spaces, write your code with proper indentation, and past the code
    into your document.

    Use page breaks to cause each listing to start on a new page.
    
    The code doesn't implement the assignment: there are no provisions
    for responding to the pushbuttons and/or for displaying the results
    in the seven segment displays.  Your Results section, "The project
    works as required." is disingenuous at best.
