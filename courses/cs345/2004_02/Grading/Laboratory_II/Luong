  This is your grading report for Laboratory II.

  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?


    No need to put so much code in the Method section.  You can
    cross-reference lines in the listings if you want to.  Or just
    describe what you did rather than tell how you did it.

    Use page breaks (Insert->Break...), not blank lines to place
    appendices on separate pages.

    Turns out Arial isn't a monospaced font (for code listings).  Use
    Lucida Console or Courier New.


  4.5/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    You did not set up the editor to expand tabs into spaces as
    sepecified in the Coding Guidelines.

    Some of the lines are too wide to fit on the page.  Use smaller tab
    stops, and check widths of lines.

    Your pipeline isn't a pipeline!  Your code moves the values down
    the pipeline array sequentially instead of in parallel.

  9.0/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
