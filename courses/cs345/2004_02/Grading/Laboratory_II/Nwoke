  This is your grading report for Laboratory II.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Write the entire Method section in the past tense.  A single
    sentence doesn't qualify as a paragraph.  Use first person singular
    rather than plural ... you are the sole author.
    
    Use Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles, as called for in the guidelines.

    Use page breaks to separate appendices; Put in a table of contents
    for appendices.
    
    What you say, though, is fine.

  4.5/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Document your code!  Comments marking the ends of blocks are
    unnecessary if you are using a "real" program editor and should be
    omitted.  (However, the DK editor is deficient ...)  But you need to
    document your code according to the guidelines.  Even simple code
    like counters.hcc.
    
    There are lots of line that are too wide for the page.  Format them
    so they all fit.  

  9.0/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
