  Dr. Vickery


  4.6/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Use Heading styles for title and section headings, as specified in
    the guidelines.

    "Laboratory II is quite Interactive."  What's that supposed to mean?

    Insert page breaks to make each code listing start on a separate
    page.
    
    Writing style and content are fine.

  4.8/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Do NOT use tabs for indentation.  Fix your editor settings so it
    expands tabs into spaces.  (There are just a few of these.  Maybe
    you fixed this while developing the code?)


  9.4/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
