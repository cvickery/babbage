  This is your grading report for Laboratory II.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.0/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Use Heading 2 for headings; sometimes you used Heading 1.

    A single sentence doesn't qualify as a paragraph.  And your
    Introduction doesn't even contain a complete sentence.

    The Method section is much too cryptic.  You have to make it
    understandable to someone who doesn't have the lab assignment in
    front of them.

    The Result section is garbled.  You should be describing the results
    of writing and testing the code.  Certainly the two separate
    projects justify at least two separate paragraphs.  And you need to
    tell what project you are talking about.  How do the results relate
    to the methodology you followed?

    It turns out Arial is not a monospaced font.  Use Lucida Console or
    Courier New instead.
    
    Start each code file on a separate page, using page breaks to
    separate them.

  4.0/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Set the editor to expand tabs into spaces; your indentation is all
    messed up.
    
    Your code is not commented!

  8.0/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
