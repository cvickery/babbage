  This is your grading report for Laboratory II.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Again, use complete sentences throughout, not the bullet list style
    you used in the Method section.  Good discussion, but "better
    switches" don't really exist; this is the nature of mechanical
    switches.  The best you could have hoped for was a "debouncing
    circuit" (an R-C network) between the switches and the FPGA, not a
    different type of switch.
    
    Put code listings in Appendices, not in the Results section.  Use
    the Results section to summarize the results you obtained.


  5.0/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Looks fine.


  9.5/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
