  This is your grading report for Laboratory II.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Use heading styles for title and section headings, as specified in
    the guidelines.

    Method section is more detailed than necessary.  You can refer to
    the code listings for the details and just summarize the algorithms
    here.

    "... 2-bit for the State ..." is not English.  "... two bits for
    ..." would be okay.

    Discussion is skimpy.  What did the projects demonstrate?

    Turns out Arial is not a monospaced font.  Use Courier New or Lucida
    Console instead.

    Use page breaks to separate code files in the appendices.


  4.3/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Code is not documented!

  8.8/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
