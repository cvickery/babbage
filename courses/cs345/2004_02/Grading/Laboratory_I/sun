  This is your grading report for Laboratory I.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Your main problem is English grammar, which you need to work on. 
    Sometimes it's just carelessness, such as "In order the program to
    count ..." instead of "In order for the program to count ...".  You
    can fix this type of problem by proofreading your report before
    submitting it, I think.  In fact, this may be all you need to do, as
    your spelling and punctuation generally look fine.
    
    In the Method section, there is no need to include lines of code
    (especially when they wrap around in the word processor and are
    nearly impossible to read anyway!).  Just outline the algorithms you
    implemented.  In this case, just summarize the changes you made.
    
    Results and Discussion are fine, except for some awkward wording.

    Appendices should be numbered and have titles: "Appendix I -
    Modified SevenSeg.hcc"


  4.5/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    You used tabs to indent the code you added, so the indentation is
    off.  Set up the editor to substitute spaces for tabs.
    
    Even though you are modifying existing code, the file name should go
    on the first line, and you should include a comment with your name
    and (in this case) a statement of the nature of your changes.


  9.0/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
