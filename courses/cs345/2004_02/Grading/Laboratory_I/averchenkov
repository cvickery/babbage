Sergey Averchenkov:

  This is your grading report for Laboratory I.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    You prepared this more in the format of a research paper than lab
    report.  Your Introduction is very nice, but I'm not requiring this
    sort of narrative in lab reports.  And you can skip the Abstract
    (although yours is very good).
    
    Write in complete sentences.  Don't use "telegraph style" as you did
    in the Abstract, and don't use bullet lists as you did in the Method
    section.
    
    Code listing belongs in an Appendix, not in the Results section. 
    Just put in sentences to tell what happened in the Results.

  5.0/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    Looks good, including lack of tabs.  I couldn't check the latter
    in your PDF file, but the indentation looks good.

  9.5/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
