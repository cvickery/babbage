  This is your grading report for Laboratory I.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Title, author, and affiliation go on separate lines, centered, and
    with the title in Heading 1 style.

    No need to double space the body of the report.

    English usage is terrible!  At the very least, make the subject and
    verb agree in number: "The goals of the first Lab is..." should be
    either "The goal of the first laboratory is..." or "The goals of the
    first laboratory are..." depending on how many goals there are.  You
    should be able to correct this type of error by proofreading your
    report before submitting it.
    
    It's not clear what distinction you are trying to make between goals
    and objectives in the Introduction.
    
    In the Method section, just outline the algorithms you implemented
    or modified.  In general there is no need to be specific about the
    statements and/or functions used in your code.
    
    The name of the "Results" section is plural.  It's a convention,
    even if there is only one result to report.
    
    The last sentence of the Discussion doesn't mean anything.  What
    were you trying to say?

    Appendices should be numbered and titled.  For example: "Appendix I:
    Modified SevenSeg.hcc".

    
  4.5/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    The first line of the listing should give the file name, even in
    this case, where you modified existing code.
    
    There should be a comment line that gives your name and, in this
    case, the nature of the changes you made.
    
    There should be _no_ tab characters in your code.  Your code is
    improperly indented as a result of there being tabs in it.

    
  9.0/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
