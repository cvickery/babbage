  This is your grading report for Laboratory I.

  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Well formatted.  As mentioned in lab, you don't need to have a
    separate title page, but it's okay.

    The Introduction tells what you did (which belongs in the Method
    section) rather than the rationale for what you did.  For this lab,
    the Introduction could be just one paragraph that says the purpose
    of the lab was to become familiar with the DK development
    environment and modify some sample code.

    In the Method section, tell what you did to the code without getting
    buried in the details, which the reader can see by reading the code
    itself in the Appendix.  For example, the first paragraph could say
    something like, "We changed the width of the counter variable from
    from 4 to 8, and modified the program so that all 8 bits are
    displayed in two seven segment displays." But remember, English
    usage says there must be at least two sentences in a paragraph, so
    the above sentence could not be an entire paragraph.
    
    For each code file, use the name of the file as the title of the
    Appendix containing it.  For projects with multiple code files
    we'll have multiple appendices, which are conventionally numbered
    with roman numerals.  So this would be "Appendix I - Modified
    version of SevenSeg.hcc.

    Method section, first line of third paragraph: "we declared to more
    unsigned, ..."


  4.5/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    You used tabs to indent your code, and as a result the indentation
    is off.

    Hard to apply the rules to code that you simply modified, but you
    should have put the file name at the beginning, and should have put
    in comments saying that the code was modified by you.


  9.0/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
