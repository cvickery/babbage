  This is your grading report for Laboratory I.

  Dr. Vickery


  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?

    Use Heading 1 style for the title, and Heading 2 style for section
    headings.
    
    The Introduction is not a sentence, and wouldn't be one even if
    there were a period at the end!  There are several sentence
    fragments in your report.  For example, "Finally changing the type
    of the counter variable and observing the effect on the display."
    doesn't have a subject.  There are several typos that you could
    correct by proofreading your document carefully before submitting
    it.  For example, "The mutually exclusive nature of the increment
    an decrement operation functional when the project is run."
    
    But the report is generally well structured and, given proper
    sentence structure, well written.
