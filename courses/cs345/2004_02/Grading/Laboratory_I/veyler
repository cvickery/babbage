  4.5/5.0 How well did your report adhere to the Laboratory Report
  Guidelines for the course?


    You need to fix your grammar and punctuation (including
    capitalization).  Write in complete sentences.  You need to give
    more information than the terse statements you made.  The idea is to
    write the report in a format suitable for informing a reader in a
    meaningful way.

    

  4.0/5.0 How well did your code adhere to the Coding Guidelines for the
  course?

    The code you added did not adhere to the guidelines.  Indentation is
    off, and it looks like you didn't follow the instructions for
    setting up the editor to substitute spaces for tabs.
    
    You didn't follow the assignment's instructions about using
    conditional compilation to select buttons versus switches.  While
    you may have your own opinion about how the project should operate,
    you are being graded in part on your ability to follow directions. 
    (This is analogous to the basis for performance reviews in the real
    world.)


  8.5/10.0  Your grade for the assignment.
