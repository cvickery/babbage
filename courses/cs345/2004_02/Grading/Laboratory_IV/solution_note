  I have written "my" lab report for this project for you to look at.
  It includes my code for the assignment and shows what a good lab
  report might look like.  It is available both as a PDF file and as a
  Word document.  To illustrate the value of using styles for the
  different headings, I put a table of contents at the beginning of
  this report.  The point of this is that Word generated the table of
  contents automatically using "Insert -> Index and Tables ..."  Also,
  if you look at the PDF file, you can see that there are "bookmarks"
  for each heading, again produced automatically.  Also, you should be
  able to click on entries in the table of contents and go directly to
  that part of the document.
