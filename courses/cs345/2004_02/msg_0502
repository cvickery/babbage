  The Nominating Committee of the Academic Senate has an opening
  for a student member from the division of Mathematics and
  Natural sciences.  You may have gotten a message about this
  before from the department's mailing list, but the position is
  still open, so I'd appreciate it if you would consider applying
  for the position yourself, or suggesting it to any of your
  friends you think might be interested.

  Serving on the committee means meeting in the middle of the day
  for an hour once a month on average.  The job of the Nominating
  Committee is to recruit people to serve on other Senate
  committees, and to review the applications for committee
  membership that we receive from students and faculty.  Then we
  make recommendations to the full Senate for them to vote on.
  It's not glamorous work, but it's a very valuable part of the
  process that enables the Senate to perform all its jobs, like
  approving curriculum changes, overseeing the operations of OIT
  and the Library, etc.  What is perhaps unusual is that people
  serving on Senate committees (including the Nominating
  Committee) don't have to be members of the Senate itself.  The
  normal term of office is two years, but student turnover is
  generally more often because of graduations.

  So, if you are interested in applying or know someone else who
  might be, there is an application form at
  http://www.qc.edu/AcademicSenate/NomCom/Application.html.
  That web page has links to more information about the Senate
  and its committees if you are interested.  Or feel free to talk
  to me about it.
