  I apologize for the short notice on this, but ...


  What I'd like to do during our Monday lecture hour for the
  remainder of the semester is to meet individually with
  each of you (or your group if you are working with someone
  else) to review the status of your project.  The meetings
  will be for ten minutes or less, and for tomorrow I'll
  hold them on a first-come, first-served basis.

  The meetings will be in my office, SB A-222, not in the
  classroom.
