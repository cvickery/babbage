  This is the first message to the CS-345 mailing list ... let me know
  if you didn't receive it!

  I've updated the Waveform Analyzer help page so it relates a bit
  better to what we are doing this semester.  Remember, you'll have
  both Monday and Wednesday's lab sessions to do the work on Lab III.

  Also, I've put a copy of the Waveform Analyzer manual on the web so
  you don't have to access the copy in the Celoxica directory of the
  lab computers.  There's a link to it from the course web page.

  I've received Lab II from most everyone.  If you sent it but didn't
  get an acknowledgement from me yet, something is wrong.

  Have a great weekend,
  Dr. Vickery
