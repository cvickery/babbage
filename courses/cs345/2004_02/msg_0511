  A couple of administrative issues:

    1.  Tomorrow (5/12) at 2:00pm, please show up for a video session
    the college is putting together to illustrate use of technology in
    teaching.  It won't hurt, you don't have to say anything, and it
    will make you rich and famous!

    2.  I will be out of town next Monday the 17th, but the lab will
    be open for business during normal lab hours.

    3.  Our "final exam" is scheduled for May 27 from 6:15 to 8:15.
    We will meet in A-205, and the "exam" will consist of your
    presentation/demonstration of your final project.  You will have
    about 15 minutes for your presentation.  I can provide a video
    projector if you want to use it either to project the RC200 LCD or
    presentation material from a computer.

  See you tomorrow at 2:00.

  Dr. Vickery
