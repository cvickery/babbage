  I'm sending this to everyone so no one will feel left out ...

  Two groups are planning to use the fft (Fast Fourier Transform)
  in their final projects.  I finally found some good tutorial
  material that includes annotated code that those people can access
  on the web.  It's chapter 12, and perhaps 13, from the book,
  Numerical Recipies, which you can download from:
    http://www.library.cornell.edu/nr/bookcpdf.html
  That's the C version.  You can poke around and get the version that
  uses Fortran instead if you think that would be more help in
  producing your Handel-C implementation ...

  I had previously been looking at an open source package called
  "kiss fft" but it's very poorly documented and the code itself is
  poorly formatted.  So, while I was able to compile and run that
  code, it was pretty much useless for working on a Handel-C version.

  That's it for now,
  Dr. Vickery
