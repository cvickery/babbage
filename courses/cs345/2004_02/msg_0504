  I'm updating the requirements for how you submit reports for the
  course.  This applies to any lab reports you haven't yet submitted
  as well as to your final project.

  1.  You are to submit a word processing document (.sxw, .pdf, or
  .doc file) as previously described.  There is to be a separate
  appendix, each starting on a new page, for each source code file.

  2.  Instead of putting the .hw and .hp files in your report, you are
  to send me a .tgz or .zip file containing the entire workspace
  directory for the laboratory or project.  However, you may remove
  the EDIF and Debug subdirectories to make the file smaller.  The
  workspace directory is the one that contains the .hw file.  Note
  that your configuration should be set up so there are no relative
  pathnames (such as to PalSim.lib, etc.).  Use absolute paths
  for the Celoxica software instead.

  Send both files as attachments to your email message.

  These are not optional suggestions: they are _required_ in order for
  you to receive credit for your work.  Similarly, I have been
  assigning relatively high grades for assignments even though they
  fail to follow the laboratory guidelines and/or coding guidelines
  for the course, but this policy changes as of now:  If you don't
  format and document your code so it's easy for me to read, you will
  receive very little credit for it.  Likewise if you don't proofread
  and structure your report(s) properly.

  On that cheery note, ...

  Dr. Vickery
