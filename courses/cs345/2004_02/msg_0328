  I've posted the write up for Laboratory V, the last one of the
  semester.  There is a link to it from the course web page.  Pardon
  the big download size, but I couldn't resist putting in some screen
  shots from my version!
  
  I made the due date for Lab V after spring break so everyone will
  have time to catch up on all the assigned labs by then.

  There will be a lecture on Monday, but that will probably be the
  last one for the term ... unless there are particular topics you
  want me to talk about.

  Send me your term project proposal by this Wednesday, the 31st.
  Remember, the proposal doesn't have to be fancy, but it does have to
  be concrete enough so that I can provide you with meaningful
  feedback about its suitability and feasability.  I want to have the
  projects approved in time for you to be able to work on them over
  spring break.

  Dr. Vickery
