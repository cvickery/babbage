  First, I've updated the handout for Lab II so that it gives the
  proper library files to include in your projects, in case you want
  to use it for reference material.

  Second, I've made some changes to the Lab Report Guidelines for the
  course.  One chage was to fix the examples of monospaced fonts;
  Arial is not one, but Lucida Console is.  And I've now added the
  requirement that you submit your workspace (.hw) and project (.hp)
  files along with the code files in the appendices.  In grading Lab
  II I realized I had no way to verify that you had set up your
  workspace and projects in accordance with the lab instructions.
  It's too late to require these other files for Lab III, but they are
  required for all labs after than.

  Finally, I'm changing the due date for Lab IV to next Monday, the
  22nd.
