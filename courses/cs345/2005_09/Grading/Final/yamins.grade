Final Project

  A carefully tuned one-octave keyboard.

  Demonstrates touchscreen input and careful generation of audio
  output signals.  Used an auxiliary C++ program to generate ROM
  values for sampling.

  Very well-written report, as usual.

  Ab remains a mystery.

Grade:  10.0/10.0
