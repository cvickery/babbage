
Final Project

  The project gives the user a touchscreen interface to a servomotor
  controller.

  The only problem with this project is that it leaves no "headroom"
  for adding potentially interesting features.  Once you got it
  working, there was nothing left to do!  (Maybe you could have
  recorded the control operations and played them back on command ...)

  The report is fine; the graphic is good.

Grade:  9.5/10.0
