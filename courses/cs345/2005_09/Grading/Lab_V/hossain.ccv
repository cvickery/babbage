Code

  Comments should tell what the code does.  But you have comments that
  give instructions that a programmer would follow to generate the
  code.  "Write a macro procedure ...."  Some documentation missing.

Report

  The main problem is that you shift tenses, often within a paragraph.
  Otherwise, the report is fine.
