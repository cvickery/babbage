
  I don't plan to send email to the class every day ... really!

  But today I'm announcing that there is a Discussion Forum available
  for you to use in the course.  There is a link to it from the course
  web page.  The number of requests that I got for this feature was
  overwhelming (1 person!); I hope everyone takes advantage of it.

  Also, Celoxica sponsors a world-wide discussion forum for academics,
  and there is a link to that on the course web page now, too.  The
  site isn't responding as I am writing this, but it's been very
  reliable in the past.
