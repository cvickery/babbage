  This is just to confirm that you should have access to the lab this
  weekend if you need it. If you go to the main gate on Kissena Blvd,
  the guards have a list with everyone's name and a copy of the key to
  the lab that you can borrow.  Be sure to lock the lab when you leave
  and to return the key to the main gate promptly so others can sign
  it out too!

  The only hitch might be that the guards might have the list filed in
  a folder named SB A-223 instead of A-227.  But it's there, and the
  key to the lab is clearly marked A-227.

  Good luck!
