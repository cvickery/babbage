Happy New Year, and apologies for not contacting you sooner about
CS-345/780.  As you undoubtedly know, the grades have been up for
quite a while ... but I forgot to send you my comments on your 4th,
5th, and final lab assignments.  So I'm about to send you emails with
those reports now.  Meanwhile, if you never got around to checking
your grades, you can still do so from the course web site.  However,
I'm going to disable the discussion forum now because it's started
attracting a lot of spammers, and I'd rather not have to deal with
them.

I enjoyed having all of you in the course last semester.

Best wishes,
Dr. Vickery
