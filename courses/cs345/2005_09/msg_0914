

  This is your first message of the semester from the CS-345/780
  mailing list.  Welcome to the course, and let me know if you don't
  get this message!!

  I think everyone has completed the required part of the code for
  Laboratory I now, so the written report is due on Friday of this
  week.  The questions for some of the questions you are to answer are
  not obvious; if you would like, I can set up a discussion forum so
  you can exchange ideas about such things.  I would monitor the
  forum, but you would be able to use it to discuss any aspect of the
  course you like, including (but not limited to) how to code and/or
  write up the labs.  Let me know if you are interested in having this
  available.

  In addition, I am assigning chapter 4 of the Pal Manual through the
  sections on LEDs, switches, and seven-segment displays.  There is a
  copy of the manual online (along with the other manuals for the
  course), which you can get to from links on the course web page.

  An optional coding assignment for Lab I is to develop a project that
  makes a LED turn on for half a second each time you press one of the
  pushbutton switches.

  I've updated the course web pages to reflect the above items.

  See you Friday,
  Dr. Vickery
