<h2>What's Here</h2>

<div class="whitebox">
  <p>For this first laboratory, I'm providing "my" laboratory report to
  give you an idea of what kinds of material go in each section.  If you
  are not familiar with using styles to structure your document, you can
  see the results in the PDF file, and how it was actually done in the
  Word document.  By using the "heading 2" style for each section
  heading, I got each heading to be formatted consistently, and then was
  able to insert cross references to each heading's text and page number
  to build the little table of contents at the beginning.  Word also has
  an automatic table of contents generator that's based on using styles
  to set up an outline of the document's structure.  If you are not
  already familiar with using heading styles to structure your
  documents, it's time to learn how to do it.</p>

  <p>Rather than give you a zip file of my workspace, I'm providing you
  with just the code listing for my modified version of
  seven_seg.hcc that you can study.</p>
