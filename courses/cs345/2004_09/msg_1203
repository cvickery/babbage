  I updated the course web page today to put the time and date for
  your "final exam" (project presentation) information up.  (The 23rd
  from 11 to 1 in SB A-205.)

  I noticed that I never had put up a link to "check my grades" on the
  web page.  It's there now, so you can check to see that what I have
  recorded for you matches the grades you've received.

  Have a good weekend,
  Dr. Vickery
