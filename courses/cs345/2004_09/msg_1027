  I have inundated with requests to have the due date for
  Laboratory IV postponed.  Well, actually, two people have
  made the request but given the size of the class that's
  pretty significant.

  The good news is that the due date has been postponed
  until November 2.

  The bad news is that Laboratory V, the last one of the
  semester, will still be available on the 28th.

  The other bad news is that we are going to have an exam,
  next Thursday (Nov 4th).  Handel-C language constructs and
  DK procedures will be the topics.

  The other good news is that it's time for you to be
  proposing your term projects.  I'll post a web page with
  info on this.
