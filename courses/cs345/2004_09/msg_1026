  This is a broadcast message to everyone registered for
  CS-345.  There are a few people who have stopped attending
  the course, but who have not dropped it either.
  
  If you do plan to drop the course, that's all right (the
  deadline for doing so is Nov. 1), but we need to know what
  your plans are now so we can adjust the lab groups
  accordingly.  Please let me know by reply email if you are
  planning to drop.

  Of course, this message doesn't apply to you if you have
  been attending the course.

  Dr. Vickery
