  This morning the door to the lab was found open.  I think
  the issue is that the door doesn't close automatically;
  you have to pull hard on it to get it to latch.  (It has
  to do with air pressure from the ventilation system.)  So
  any time you leave the lab, be sure to pull the door
  closed behind you.
