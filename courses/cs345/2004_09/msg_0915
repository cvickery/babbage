  I updated the assignment sheet for Laboratory II today.  It corrects
  some typos and adds more of a description of what is supposed to
  happen in the Pipeline project.

  Also, Koya Matsuo (technical support for the department) reports
  that he has now made ssh available on the computers in both labs.
  As I mentioned earlier, this can be useful for copying your work
  to/from computers outside the lab.  But it wasn't actually working
  before now.  If you use ssh to log into a computer in the lab, you
  will get to a bash (Cygwin shell) prompt from your Cygwin home
  directory.  To get to your projects, use the cd command to go to
  /cygdrive/c/Documents\ and\ Settings/<your_account_name>/My\
  Documents/My\ Projects.  That seems weird, I know, but the
  backslashes (\) are used to quote the spaces in the pathname, and
  the forward slashes(/) are the standard Unix pathname separator
  character.  And /cygdrive/c is Cygwin's way of talking about
  Windows' C: drive.  This is all new stuff, so note carefully
  whatever problems you have with it so we can try to make it a useful
  feature of the lab.
