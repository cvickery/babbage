
  I have had copies of the Handel-C Language Reference
  Manual printed and bound.  You can purchase a copy for
  what it cost to prepare them: $18.25 each.  I'll bring
  them to the lab tomorrow (Tuesday).

  A couple of notes:  Feel free to use the color laser
  printer in the lab to print reference material, but limit
  yourself to a "reasonable" amount of printing.  For
  example, printing a copy of the 380 page Handel-C manual
  would not be "reasonable."  Also, the manuals I printed at
  Kinko's are black and white; they would have been about
  $90.00 per copy for color!

  See you Tuesday,
  Dr. Vickery
