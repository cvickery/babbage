NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:535 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargetted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFG symbol "B2_rc200e_CLKBUF" (output signal=ClockInput_rc200e_W3),
   BUFG symbol "B5_rc200e_CLKBUF" (output signal=ClockInput_rc200e_W7),
   BUFG symbol "B9_rc200e_RC200Clock50000000BUFG" (output signal=WG11_rc200e)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   6 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
   6 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

The signal "ClockInput_rc200e_W3" is loadless and has been removed.
 Loadless block "B2_rc200e_CLKBUF" (CKBUF) removed.
  The signal "W4_rc200e" is loadless and has been removed.
   Loadless block "B3_rc200e_CLKBUF" (CKBUF) removed.
    The signal "PADIN_ClockInPin_0_rc200e_W1" is loadless and has been removed.
     Loadless block "AB12" (PAD) removed.
The signal "ClockInput_rc200e_W7" is loadless and has been removed.
 Loadless block "B5_rc200e_CLKBUF" (CKBUF) removed.
  The signal "W8_rc200e" is loadless and has been removed.
   Loadless block "B6_rc200e_CLKBUF" (CKBUF) removed.
    The signal "PADIN_ClockInPin_0_rc200e_W5" is loadless and has been removed.
     Loadless block "B11" (PAD) removed.
