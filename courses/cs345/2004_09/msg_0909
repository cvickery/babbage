  I've updated the handout for Laboratory I, and reorganized the
  course web page to make the most frequently needed material is near
  the top of the page.

  When you get a fresh copy of the handout, verify that the
  modification date at the bottom of the first page is September 9.
  Sometimes you have to tell the browser to reload the page to get the
  current version.
