  As you (should) know, you can use the computers in A-205 any time
  the college is open to work on your projects.  When the department
  office is open, you can check out a Celoxica kit to use in A-205.

  I have also asked that a list of students in the course be sent to
  the main gate guardhouse on Kissena Blvd.  You will be able to go
  there on weekends and sign out for a key to the lab (A-227).  There
  is only one key kept there, so it's critical that you return it to
  the main gate as soon as you leave the lab so that other students
  may sign it out after you.  Do not let anyone in the lab when you
  are there except for other students in the course, and be sure the
  door closes and locks when you leave.  I can't guarantee that you
  will have access to the main gate key this weekend, but it _should_
  be available.
