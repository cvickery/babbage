<h2><a id="forum">Discussion Forum</a></h2>
<div class="whitebox">

  <p>There is a discussion forum for asking and answering questions
  about DK and Handel-C hosted by the <a
  href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Department of Computing at Imperial
  College of London</a>.  Students and faculty from around the world
  use this as the place to go to offer and receive help using the
  language and hardware we use in our course.  I encourage you to take
  advantage of it!</p>

  <p>If you are using Firefox as your browser, you will see an orange
  icon in the lower right corner of your browser window, which
  indicates that the forum provides an RSS feed.  You can click on
  that icon to bookmark the forum, with the option to put the link in
  your bookmark toolbar.  That way, you can always quickly check
  what's happening on the forum just by clicking on the link in your

  <li><h3>Class Meetings</h3>
    <p>The class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:05 to 4:20 in SB
    B-141 with the following exceptions:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>There will be no class on Thursday, September 16 because
      the college will be closed for the Rosh Hashanah holiday.</li>

      <li>There will be <b>no class on Thursday, October 7</b>.  We
      will make up this missed class by extending the other class
      meetings of the term by three minutes each.</li>

      <li>The college will follow a Thursday class schedule on
      Tuesday, November 16.  But that won't affect us because our
      class meets on both Tuesdays and Thursdays.</li>

      <li>Tuesday December 14 follows a Wednesday schedule at the
      college. Our last class meeting therefore will be Thursday,
      December 9.</li>

      <li>The final exam is scheduled for Thursday December 23 from
      11:00 to 1:00.  Contact the Registrar's Office immediately if this
      time conflicts with another exam.  You will give a 15 minute
      presentation of your final project to the class at this time;
      there will be no actual final exam.</li>

      <li>After the first class, we will generally meet in the
      laboratory, SB A-227.</li>

      <li>You may also use the computers in SB A-205 to work on your
      assignments outside of the normally scheduled times.  (Use the
      ones that are named for trees.)  Also, if you have broadband
      access to the internet from off campus, you may access any of the
      computers in A-227 and/or A-205 using Windows' <i>remote
      desktop</i> application.

      <p class="box"><b>Be sure you log off from any laboratory computer
      before you disconnect a remote desktop session or leave one of the
      laboratory rooms.  Failure to do so will reduce your course grade
      by 5 points for each occurrence.</b></p></li>

    </ul></li>

  <li><h3><a id="manuals">Textbook</a></h3>
    <p>There is no textbook for the course, but you will be using
    several manuals and tutorials, which are available online as PDF
    files.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="../Manuals/">Manuals</a></li>

      <li><a href="../Restricted/Using_Handel-C_with_DK.pdf">Celoxica
      Tutorial</a> (1.2 MB).

      <p>This tutorial is a 330 page slide show used by Celoxica for a
      commercial course they offer.  Access to it is restricted to
      students taking this course, and it may only be used for academic
      purposes.</p></li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li><h3>Office Hours</h3>
    <p>My office is SB A-222, and my office hours will be Tuesdays and
    Thursdays from 4:30 to 5:30.  But the best way to do office hour
    business is usually by email: <b>vickery##babbage.cs.qc.edu</b>. 
    (Change <b>##</b> to an at sign.)</p></li>

  <li><h3>Grades</h3>
    <p>There will be approximately 5 required laboratory assignments,
    which will each count 5% of the course grade.  They will be graded
    on the form and content of the written laboratory report, how well
    the code adheres to the coding guidelines for the course, and how
    well the project functions, in that order of importance.</p> <p>The
    midterm exam will count 25% of the course grade.</p> <p>The final
    project will count the remaining 50% of the course grade. It will be
    graded using the same criteria as the laboratory assignments, except
    15% of the project grade will be based on your presentation to the
    class on December 23.</p></li>
