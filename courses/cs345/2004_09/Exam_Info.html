  <p>What to expect on the exam?  Given there's never been an exam in
  this coures, that's a pretty good question.  Basically, the goal of
  the exam is to evaluate whether you have been taking an active part in
  the development of the structured labs for the course.  How well do
  you know the Handel-C language?  Do you know how to work with the DK
  development environment?  And do you understand the interfaces we've
  worked with on the RC-200E?</p>
  
  <p><b>Handel-C.</b>  You should be able to recognize, explain, and
  write sample code that relates to Handel-C's special features:
  variable widths, the differences among arrays, rom, and ram.  Par
  blocks and par "loops."  Bit selection and bit manipulations. 
  Clocks.  Channels, signals , and busses.  Macro procedures, macro
  expressions, and preprocessor macros.  How to write a delay macro
  procedure.  <p>

  <p><b>DK.</b> Workspaces, projects, and source files.  Header
  (include) files and libraries.  Simulation and EDIF design flows. 
  Errors to look for, warnings that can be ignored, and warnings that
  should not be ignored.  Use of the Waveform Analyzer.  Pal macros and
  libraries.</p>

  <p><b>RC200E.</b>  Switches, LEDs, seven-segment displays.  Expansion
  header pins, the RS-232 interface.  LCD output and pipelined RAM.</p>
