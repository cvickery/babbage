  Hot off the presses is Celoxica's "Using Handel-C with DK"
  tutorial.  I reviewed a draft copy of it over the summer
  and used it during the initial lectures this semester.  I
  think you'll find it very useful.  Celoxica uses it when
  they run a training course for industry.

  There is a link to it from the "Manuals and Tutorials"
  section of the course web page.  Note that you'll have to
  use your secret username (cs345) and password (2004_09) to
  access it.

  Here's a suggested strategy:  Go over the first four
  chapters of the Handel-C manual quickly to see what's
  there, but don't try to study or memorize them the first
  time through.  Then start going through the tutorial
  slides, again just to see what's there.  Finally, as you
  do your projects, look things up in the Language manual as
  needed, and use the tutorial explain and give examples
  for things that aren't clear from the manual.

  Have a great weekend,
  Dr. Vickery
