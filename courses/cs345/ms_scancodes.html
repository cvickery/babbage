<h1>Microsoft's Keyboard Scancode Specification</h1>

  <p class="indent">The document, which Microsoft provides only in Word
  format, is designed for keyboard manufacturers who wish to make
  products that are compatible with Windows.  On page 11 there is a
  diagram that gives reference numbers for the different keys on a
  keyboard.  Then, starting on page 16, there is a table that tells
  what scan code each key transmits to the computer when it is pressed
  (the "make" code) and when it is released (the "break" code).  The
  "scan 1" columns are for old keyboards; the "scan 2" columns are for
  most keyboards in use today.</p>
