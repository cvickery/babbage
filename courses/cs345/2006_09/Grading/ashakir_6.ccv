Comments on Laboratory VI
-------------------------

  Coding Style and Documentation:

    Samples are not managed well -- the numSample_value variable is
    incremented in 8 different places -- and it goes out of range for
    two of the three arrays that it indexes into.

  User Interface

    Primitive, but useable.

  Other Comments:
