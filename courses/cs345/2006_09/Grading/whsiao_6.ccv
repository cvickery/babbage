Comments on Laboratory VI
-------------------------

  Coding Style and Documentation:

    Comments still show language problems.
    Code needs to be formatted so you don't have to scroll
    horizontally to read it.
    Lots of dividers make the design resource-intensive.

  User Interface

    Primitive shapes, but okay.

  Other Comments:
