Comments on Laboratory V
------------------------

  Workspace set up, including delayProcs management:

    OK

  Accuracy of usecDelay:

    Looks perfect.

  Code Documentation:

    Generally good, but a bit wordy: "A while loop to... " is
    unnecessary wordiness given that the next line of code is "while
    (1)".

  Other Comments:

    None
