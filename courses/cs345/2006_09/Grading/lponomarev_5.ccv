Comments on Laboratory V
------------------------

  Workspace set up, including delayProcs management:

    Good

  Accuracy of usecDelay:

    Pulse width appears to be 2 usec short, but it's hard to measure
    because the period is a bit over 20 msec.  This is in simulation
    mode, where the clock rate is slow and magnifies this sort of
    thing.

  Code Documentation:

    Good

  Other Comments:

    None
