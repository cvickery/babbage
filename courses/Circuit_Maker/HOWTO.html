<h1>Getting Started With Circuit Maker</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In this course, we will be using the free student edition of a
commercial program, <a
href="http://www.microcode.com/downloads/student.htm">CircuitMaker</a>,
to design and simulate logic circuits.  You can also get a copy of the
student version of CircuitMaker from my office using this link: <a
href="./circuitmaker_student.exe">Download CircuitMaker from my
office</a>.  Note that this software is avaialbe only for student use
on their own computers; it is not available for use on college
computers.  The file you download (3,400,151 bytes) is a
self-installing package for Windows; just click on it to start the
installation process.  Let me know if you do not have access to a
computer on which you can install this software.</p>

<a name="help"></a>
<h2>Using the Program</h2>

<p>The program is very well designed, but it is not something that you
can just pick up and start using without some instruction.  That's
because it assumes you already know how to design digital logic, and
does not provide real tutorial material.</p>

<p>What follows are some pointers to help you get started and to help
you avoid some common problems.  There is also help that comes with
the program, but it tends to be sketchy.</p>

<ol>

  <li><p>The first thing to realize is that CircuitMaster can be used to
  design and simulate both analog and digital signals.  (Wherever you
  see "Spice" in the help system, it's talking about analog
  simulation.)  You can build your circuit with out concern for this
  fact, but when you simulate it (run it), you must be sure to do so in
  digital mode.  If you don't, you'll get a cryptic message, probably
  telling you that you need a ground node "before a valid spice netlist
  can be generated".  To avoid this problem click on the toolbar button
  with the symbol for a transistor on it; it's exactly in the middle,
  12 buttons in from both ends of the toolbar.</p>
  
  <p>Just get in the habit of clicking on the transistor button (it
  turns into an AND gate) everytime you start running CircuitMaker.</p>

  <p class="indent">If you get a message about "missing ground" when you
  try to simulate your circuit, read the above paragraphs!</p>

  <li><p>If you care about the neatness of your diagrams, select
  <i>Grid</i> under the Options menu, and select the "Snap to grid"
  option.  I personally find it distracting to display the grid itself,
  but that's a choice you can make from the same menu.</p>

  <li><p>Use the <i>Devices</i> menu to select gates, etc. to add to
  your circuit.  Many simple gates and devices are listed on the
  Hotkey submenu without the need to browse through device and parts
  lists.  Use the Wire Tool (the toolbar button that looks like
  a plus sign) to connect inputs and outputs together.</p>

  <li><p>A common input device is the digital logic switch,
  which alternates between outputting 0 or 1 each time you click on
  in.  You can type a lower-case 's' to get one, or look for it in
  Hotkeys2 under the Devices menu, or select browse from the Devices
  menu, and select Digital -&gt; Power.</p>
  
  <li><p>The Hex Keypad device is very useful when you need to set
  several inputs at once.  It has four outputs that you can control by
  typing a hex digit while the keypad is selected.  Or click on it to
  make it step up by one.</p>

  <li><p>You can simulate your circuit one step (propagation delay) at
  a time, or let it run at "full speed."   EIther way, you can use the
  probe tool (the 8th button from the right end of the toolbar, next to
  the button that has an inverter on it) to look at the logic value of
  any part of your circuit.  The probe will show H ("high"), L ("low"),
  or Z (indeterminate) as you make it hover over various parts of the
  circuit.</p>
  
  <p>Better yet, turn on the trace option (under simulation options, or
  press F11).  With this option on, the wires are colored to show their
  logic state and you don't need a probe.</p>

  <li><p>You will want to look at the waveforms for various parts of
  the circuit as you run your simulations.  Use F12 to turn this option
  on, or press the toolbar button to the right of the one with the
  inverter on it.  The waveforms are displayed in a separate window, so
  select "tile" from the Window menu to get them both to show on the
  screen.</p>

  <li><p>The most common way to add traces to the waveforms window is to
  attach the Scope tool to the wires you want to look at.  Type
  captial T to get a Scope tool, or select it from the Hotkeys2 menu
  under the Devices menu.  To give meaningful names to your waveforms,
  double-click on the scope tool and type in the name you want to
  use.</p>

  <li><p>You can move waveforms up and down by dragging their names in
  the waveforms window.  The white boxes to the left of the names are
  used for setting breakpoints.  You can learn how to use breakpoints
  from the on-line help.</p>

  <li><p>The simplest clock source is the Pulser device.  Ignore the
  inputs, and just use either output (one is the complement of the
  other) as your clock signal.</p>

  <li><p>Another way to get a clock signal to generate it using a
  <i>Data Sequencer</i>.  Type captial G to get one, or browse to it
  under Digital/Instruments under the Devices menu.  Here's how to set
  it up so that pin 1 on the right side can be used as a clock
  signal:</p>

  <p>Double click on the device, and you will get an "Edit Data
  Sequencer" dialog box.  First of all, resist the temptation to turn
  on the "Use External Clock" option; it generates values at the
  proper rate for simulation (one propagation delay per step) all by
  itself.  Edit the first 8 rows of the "Address - Data" box so that
  addresses 1, 2, 3, 4 contain 00, and addresses 5, 6, 7, 8 contain 01.
  Set the Start and Stop Addresses to 1 and 8 respectively.</p>

  <p>When the simulation runs, the sequencer will output 0 on output
  No. 1 for four propagation delays, then will output 1 on the same
  output pin for another four propagation delays.  The process repeats
  as long as the simulation runs.  Connect a scope tool to the output
  to add this waveform to your waveform window.</p>
  
  <p>This device can be used to generate any sequence of arbitrary 8-bit
  values, which makes it useful for testing certain complex
  circuits.</p>
