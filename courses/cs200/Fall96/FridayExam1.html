<P>
1. (15 points) Write a Unix command to accomplish each of the
following:
<OL>
<LI>Create a directory named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">project_dir</FONT></TT>
in the current directory.
<LI>Make the directory named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">project_dir</FONT></TT>
the current directory.
<LI>List the names and sizes of all the files in the current directory.
<LI>Delete all files in the current directory that have the letter
'<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">a</FONT></TT>' somewhere
in their names.
<LI>Copy a file named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">a_nice_file</FONT></TT>
from Dr. Vickery's home directory to the current directory.
<LI>Use the compiler driver to translate <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">main.cc</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">gcd.cc</FONT></TT> into
an executable file named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">gcd</FONT></TT>.
<LI>Get rid of the files that don't belong in a project directory
when you submit an assignment.
<LI>Create a <I>tar</I> file for submitting an assignment.
</OL>
<P>
2. (10 points) Write a complete C++ program that prompts the user
to enter three numbers of type float, reads the numbers, and displays
their average.
<P>
3. (15 points) Write C++ code that creates a variable named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">uni</FONT></TT>
which can hold an integer, a long, a float, a pointer to an integer,
a pointer to a long, or a pointer to a float. Write a statement
that prints the value of the long.  Assume an integer is four
bytes and all the other data types are eight bytes long.  How
big is <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">uni</FONT></TT>?
<P>
4. (15 points) Write C++ statements to create a variable named
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">a_str</FONT></TT> that can
hold the address of a character and which is initialized with
the address of the first character in the constant <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">&quot;hello&quot;</FONT></TT>.
 Tell how much memory the compiler reserves for the variable and
how much it reserves for the constant.  Draw a diagram to show
the relationship between the variable and the constant.
<P>
5. (15 points) Write a function that computes the maximum of three
values.  Use a template so the function will work with any data
type so long as all three values are of the same data type.  Efficiency
of your algorithm counts.
<P>
6. (10 points) What is the &quot;mangled&quot; name that g++ uses
for this function:<BR>
 <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">int someFunc(int, char *,
float, int, int);</FONT></TT>
<P>
7. (20 points) Write a complete C++ program that prompts the user
to type a word.  If the word is &quot;<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">exit</FONT></TT>&quot;
the program terminates.  If the word is &quot;<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">show</FONT></TT>&quot;
the program displays everything the user has entered so far, and
if the word is anything else, the program prompts the user for
a number, reads the number, and then asks the user for another
word..  All the words (except &quot;<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">show</FONT></TT>&quot;)
and their numbers are kept in an array of appropriate data structures.
 If the array fills up, the program displays all the entries in
the array, and terminates.  Assume the users never type more than
31 characters in a word and never type blanks inside a word.
