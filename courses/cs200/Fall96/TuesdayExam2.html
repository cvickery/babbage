<BODY>
<P>
1. (A) Write the command line to start debugging an executable
program named <I>myprog</I> using the <I>gdb</I> debugger. (B)
Tell what <I>gdb</I> command would be used to set a breakpoint
to stop your program when it reaches the function <I>main()</I>.
 (C) Tell what <I>gdb</I> command would be used to start a program
running.
<P>
2. Name the two <I>gdb</I> commands for executing a program one
statement at a time; tell the difference between the two.
<P>
3. If a program contains a variable named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">aPtr</FONT></TT>,
which is a pointer to a <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">struct</FONT></TT>,
tell how you could use <I>gdb</I> to see (A) the numeric value
of the pointer, and (B) the contents of the <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">struct</FONT></TT>
that it points to.
<P>
4. In C++, tell the difference between an inline function and
a normal function.
<P>
5. Write the code to declare a class named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">SomeClass</FONT></TT>.
 The class is to have a constructor that takes an <I>int</I> as
its argument, a function named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">setValue</FONT></TT>
that takes an <I>int</I> as its argument, another function named
<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">getValue</FONT></TT> that
takes no arguments and returns an <I>int</I>, and which can be
used for <I>const</I> objects of the class, and a private <I>int</I>
data member named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">value</FONT></TT>.
 <I>Note:</I> you are to write just the class declaration, not
the implementation of the member functions.
<P>
6. Write the code to declare another class named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">Counter</FONT></TT>
that has a data member to keep track of how many objects of that
class have been created.  Include the parts of the class that
define the counter variable and the three functions that increment,
decrement, and return the value of the counter, but no other member
functions or data members for the class.  <I>Note:</I>  For this
question, you are to write the parts of the class declaration
indicated and to include the definitions (not just the declarations)
of the three functions indicated.
<P>
7. What is the difference between a deep copy and a shallow copy?
<P>
8. Write the code to declare the part of a class named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">String</FONT></TT>
that overrides the <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">+</FONT></TT>
operator to do concatenation.  <I>Bonus: (up to 6.25 points) 
</I>Show the implementation of the function.
