<H1 ALIGN=center>Property List Project, Part 2</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

This document describes "Homework 5b,"  The second part of the
Property List project.  The due date is Week 8 (10/29; 10/25).<p>

For this assignment, You will add two new commands to the program
you wrote for Homework 5a:  In addition to "<code>exit</code>" and
a property name, change your program so that it recognizes the
commands, "<code>getval</code>" and "<code>show</code> ."  The
<code>getval</code> command is used to display the value part of
a property list entry, and <code>show</code> displays all the entries
in the property list.<p>

Your application program must use the three functions whose prototypes
are in <code>~vickery/CS-200/Homework_5b/plist.h</code>: <i>insert(),
getValue(),</i> and <i>showList()</i>.  Note that the prototype for
<i>insert()</i> for this assignment is slightly different from the
prototypes used for Homework_5a.  You must use the new
<code>plist.h</code> for this assignment, so you will have to change
the code you wrote to call <i>insert()</i> before.<p>

You are also to implement the three functions listed above.  For your
convenience in developing this assignment, there is a compiled
version of the solution in
<code>~vickery/CS-200/Homework_5b/plist.o</code>.  Your application
program must work with this version of <code>plist.o</code> as well
as with the one that you write yourself.  Again, the
<code>plist.o</code> file for this assignment is different from the one
for Homework_5a, so be sure to use the correct one.<p>

<h3>Requirements: </h3>
<UL>
<LI>The property list must be implemented as a linked list, not as an
array.
<LI>The property list must be sorted by property name at all times.  If
the same property name occurs twice (or more) the sequence of those
entries does not matter. [Optional: sort entries with the same name
according to their types.]
<LI>Every name/type combination in the list must be unique.
<LI>You must use the file "<code>plist.h</code>" that I supplied in both
your application program and in your implementation of the Property
List package.
<LI>Your main program must work properly when linked with the
<code>plist.o</code> that I supplied, as well as with your own.
<LI>You must use a Makefile that will build your program.  You may use
the one in <code>~vickery/CS-200/Homework_5b</code> if you wish, or you
may write your own, or you may modify the one that I supplied.  When you
submit the assignment, provide only your own source files.  Do not send any
binary files or copies of my <code>plist.h</code> or
<code>Makefile</code>.  (Of course, if your <code>Makefile</code> is
different from mine, send yours.)

Your output does not have to look exactly like this, but you may use it
as a model.
