This assignment is due by midnight of your class date for Week 4
(9/24; 9/27).<p>

Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter a name and a value,
and enters each pair into an array of <i>struct</i>s.  Each name is to
be any string the user wishes to type, but may not contain spaces.  The
value is to be an <i>int</i>.<p>
 
If the user types "exit" as a name, the program is to exit.  If the user
types "show &lt;n&gt;" (where &lt;n&gt; is an integer), the program is
to display the name and value pair at entry number &lt;n&gt; in the
array, if there is one; otherwise display an error message.  The program
continues to run after "show" commands.<p>
 
Here is a partial implementation of the program for you to start with:
 
<pre>
 
#include &lt;iostream.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
 
struct element {
 
  char  name[100];
  int   value;
 
  };
 
int
main() {
 
element theArray[1000];
 
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++) {
 
    cout &lt;&lt; "Enter a name and its value: ";
    cin &gt;&gt; theArray[i].name &gt;&gt; theArray[i].value;
 
    if (0 == strcasecmp(theArray[i].name, "exit")) return 0;
 
    }
 
  }
</pre> 
[In the Tuesday section I used "if (!strcmp(... " instead of "if (0 ==
strcasecmp( ...". <i>strcasecmp()</i> does a case-insensitive
comparison.  That is, the user can type "Exit" or "exit" (or "ExIt",
etc.) and the comparison will come out equal.  The "0 ==" in place of
"!" is just a little less obscure, I think.]<p>
 
This program may be written as a single .cc source file.  You do not
have to use a Makefile.  Nor are you required to define any functions
other than <i>main()</i> for this program.<p>
 
Here are some things for you to think about as you write your program.
You are not required to implement any of the items listed here, and you
are not to hand in answers to these questions.  Just think about them!
(If you <i>do</i> deal with any of these items in your program, leave a
<code>README</code> file in your project directory telling me about them.)
 
<ul>
<li>What happens if the user supplies more than 1000 entries?
<li>What happens to an entry if the user enters a "show" command.  Does
"show" become an entry, or is that element of the array reused?
<li>How could you implement a "delete" command?
<li>How about a "showall" command that shows all entries defined so far?
<li>The numbers 100 and 1000 are hard-coded into the sample program,
which makes the program inflexible.  How could this inflexibility be
reduced?  (You can't use a variable as the size of an array in C++, at
least not in the part of the language we have looked at so far.)
<li>How about letting the user enter other types of values besides
integers?
</ul>
