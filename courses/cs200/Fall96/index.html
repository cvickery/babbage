<H2><A NAME="as-h2-27020">Syllabus and Assignments</A></H2>

This syllabus lists the topics I expect to cover each week.  As the
semester progresses, I will revise it to reflect what actually was
done.<P>

Each section of the course meets once a week.  Where dates appear in
parentheses, the first date is for the Tuesday section (ttc3a) and the
second is for the Friday section (ffc3a).<P>

<H3><A NAME="as-h3-27028">Week 8 (10/29; 10/25)</A></H3>

Discussion of topics related to Homework 5b.  This assignment is being
graded on a ten-point scale instead of 2 points.  It will be accepted
late, with a penalty of one point (out of ten) per day late.  Weekends
do not count in computing late points.<p>

<B>Assignment Due Next Class: </B> Read Chapter 6, and complete the
Self-Review Exercises at the end of the chapter.

<H3><A NAME="as-h3-27029">Week 9 (11/5; 11/1)</A></H3>

Introduction to classes and object-oriented design.  Review of Homework
5 as an object-oriented design based; Application Programming Interface
(API), header files, and libraries.  Class Syntax; public and private
members.  Memory layout of a process: stack, heap, data, and code
segments; where objects, functions, and variables reside in memory; how
to reference objects using pointers and variables.<P>

<B>Assignment Due Next Class: </B>  Finish Chapter 6.  Plan how to
implemnt the Property List class.

<H3><A NAME="as-h3-270210">Week 10 (11/12; 11/8)</A></H3>
Review memory allocation for variables and objects.  Implementing the
Property List class:  Changes to the header file, changes to
<i>main()</i>, changes to <code>plist.cc</code>.  Inline functions and
how performance issues impact encapsulation.<P>

<B>Assignment Due Next Class: </B> Read Chapter 7.  Rework Homework 5b so
that it implements and uses the Plist class defined in
<code>~vickery/CS-200/Homework_6/plist.h</code>.  Be sure your
application program links with
<code>~vickery/CS-200/Homework_6/plist.o</code> and runs correctly
before implementing your own <code>plist.o</code>.  <B>Note:</B> You are
free to edit the private part of the Plist class definition in
<code>plist.h</code> for this exercise, but no other public part.

<H3><A NAME="as-h3-270211">Week 11 (11/19; 11/15)</A></H3>

When constructors and destructors are called.  Static data members and
static member functions.  Declaring const objects and member functions
that may be used with const objects.  Initializing const data members. 
Compound classes and initializing subobjects.<p>

<B>Note:  There will be an exam during the last 45 minutes of the first
class after Thanksgiving recess.</B><p>

<B>Assignment Due Next Class: </B> Read Chapter 8.  Use <i>gdb</i> to
step through Exercise 7.9 from the textbook.  There is a web page on
<i>gdb</i> at:
<code>http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs701/Handouts/using_gdb.html</code>.


<H3><A NAME="as-h3-270212">Week 12 (11/26; 11/22)</A></H3>

Review of four uses of <i>static</i> in C++ and what they mean (static
local variables, static global variables, static data members, static
member functions).  Operator overloading examples.<p>

<B>Assignment Due Next Class: </B>(Homework #7)  Add the commands
<i>clone</i> and <i>showclone</i> to the driver program for your Plist
class exercise.  Your <i>main()</i> function should declare two objects
of class <code>Plist</code>.  In class we called them
<code>theList</code> and <code>cloneList</code>.  When the user enters
the <i>clone</i> command, the main program does an assignment of
<code>theList</code> to <code>cloneList</code>, and when the user enters
the <i>showclone</i> command the program displays the current state of
the <code>cloneList</code> Plist.  Sample code:<p>
<pre>
      int main() {
      
      Plist       theList, cloneList;
      
      ...
      
          case DO_CLONE:
            cloneList = theList;
            break;
          case DO_SHOW_CLONE:
            cloneList.showList();
            break;
      ...
</pre>

Submit two versions of <code>plist.cc</code>.  One version, to be named
<code>plist_s.cc</code> is to implement <i>operator=()</i> to do a
shallow copy of the list, and the other version, to be named
<code>plist_d.cc</code> is to implement <i>operator=()</i> to do a deep
copy of the list.  Be sure to test both versions of the program to make
sure they behave as expected.<p>

The following items are not required, but would be good practice for
you:<UL><LI>Delete all nodes of the existing <code>cloneList</code> whenever
you create a new <code>cloneList</code>.<LI>Replace your
<i>showList()</i> member function with an overloaded <code><<</code>
operator.</UL>If you do implement either of these, leave a
<code>README</code> file in your project directory so I will know about
it.<p>

There will be an exam during the last 45 minutes of the next class.  It
will cover material from chapters 6-8 plus concepts covered in class
that may not come directly from the book, such as the relationships
between memory segments and the various elements of a C++ program. 
Doing Homework #7 will help prepare you for the exam.  Students who
received 90 or above on the previous exam do not have to take this one;
if they do take it but score less than 90, it will not count against
them.<p>

<H3><A NAME="as-h3-270213">Week 13 (12/3; 12/6)</A></H3>

Operator overloading.  Unary and binary operators; how the compiler
recognizes overloaded operators.  The need for friend functions for
<code>operator<<()</code> and <code>operator>>()</code>.<p>
Exam Number 3.<p>

<H3><A NAME="as-h3-270214">Week 14 (12/10; 12/13)</A></H3>

More operator overloading examples.  Inheritance.  "Is a" <i>vs</i> "has
a" relationships (inheritance <i>vs</i> composition).  Base classes and
derived classes.  Base/derived class pointer assignments.<p>

<b>Extra Credit Assignment.</b>  This assignment may be used to make up
the equivalent of one "small" homework this term.  (All homeworks were
small except Homework 5b.)  It must be submitted by midnight of
December 23 to be elegible for credit.  The assignment is to implement
a new class derived from Plist that has the additional property of
being sorted in either ascending or decending order.  The constructor
for this new class is to take an argument "up" or "down" that tells
which way the list is to be sorted.  Modify your main program so that
there is one "up" list, one "down" list, and one "clone" list that
might be a copy of either the up list or a down list.  (The clone list
should be of class Plist.)  The user commands "up" and "down" tell the
program which list new elements are to be added to.<p>

<b>Where to go from here.</b>  The following books are recommended for
continuing your study of C++:

<dl>

  <dt><b>Reference Manual</b>
  <dd>There are two books on C++ written by Bjarne Stroustrup, the author of the C++
  language.  They give all the details of the the language, and explain
  the reasons the language has the features that it does.  One is <i>The
  C++ Programming Language, Second Edition</i>, and the other is <i>The
  Annotated C++ Reference Manual</i> by Margaret A. Ellis and
  Stroustrup.  Both are published by Addison-Wesley, and are available
  from local bookstores.

  <dt><b>The Standard Template Library</b>
  <dd>The Standard Template Library (STL) provides generic
  implementations of data structures and associated functions that can
  be used with objects of any type or class.  Once you understand the
  language itself, using the library is the best way to implement real
  programs for the best portability, generality, and efficiency.  The
  library is available for most C++ compilers, including the GNU
  compiler we used in this course. A good book on the STL is <i>STL
  Tutorial and Reference Guide</i> by David R. Musser and Atul Saini. 
  Addison-Wesley, 1996.

  <dt><b>Design Patterns</b>
  <dd>If you are interested in what is emerging as a key feature of
  object-oriented software engineering, you need to know about design
  patterns.  The book that introduced the concept is <i>Design
  Patterns</i> by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John
  Vlissides.  Addison-Wesley, 1995.  As the authors acknowledge, you
  won't "get it" the first time you read this book, but when you re-read
  it and continue to work in the field, you will get more and more out
  of it.

  </dl>

<H3><A NAME="final_exam">Final Exam (December 19)</A></H3>
The final exam for both my sections of CS-200 will be held on Thursday
December 19 from 1:45 to 3:45 in SB C-201 (one of the lecture halls in
the middle of the Science Building).<p>
Exam questions may be drawn from the entire course, but the main
emphasis will be on the material in Chapters 6-9 of the textbook.<p>
