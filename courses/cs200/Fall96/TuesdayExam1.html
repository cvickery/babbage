<P>
1. (15 points) Write a Unix command to accomplish each of the
following:
<OL>
<LI>Create a directory named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">project_dir</FONT></TT>
under the current directory.
<LI>Make the directory named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">project_dir</FONT></TT>
the current directory.
<LI>List the names and sizes of all the files in the current directory.
<LI>Delete all files in the current directory that have the letter
'<TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">a</FONT></TT>' anywhere in
their names.
<LI>Copy a file named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">some_file</FONT></TT>
from Dr. Vickery's <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">CS-200</FONT></TT>
directory into the current directory.
<LI>Use the compiler driver to translate <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">plist.cc</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">main.cc</FONT></TT> into
an executable file named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">plist</FONT></TT>.
<LI>Get rid of the files that don't belong in a project directory
when you submit an assignment.
<LI>Create a <I>tar</I> file for submitting an assignment.
</OL>
<P>
2. (10 points) Write a complete C++ program that prompts the user
to enter three numbers of type float, reads the numbers, and displays
the value of the smallest.
<P>
3. (15 points) Write C++ code that creates a variable named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">stuff</FONT></TT>
which can hold an integer, a long, a pointer to an integer, and
a pointer to a long. Write a statement that prints the value of
the long.  Assume an integer is four bytes and all the other data
types are eight bytes long.  Ignoring any extra bytes the compiler
might insert to align data items on address boundaries, how big
is <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">stuff</FONT></TT>?
<P>
4. (15 points).  Write C++ statements to declare a pointer to
char named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">ptrToChar</FONT></TT>
and a char array named <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">charArray</FONT></TT>
that is just large enough to hold the string <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">&quot;this
string&quot;</FONT></TT>.  Write an assignment statement that
puts the address of the first byte of <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">charArray</FONT></TT>
into <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">ptrToChar</FONT></TT>.
 How big are <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">ptrToChar</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">charArray</FONT></TT>,
in bytes?
<P>
5. (15 points) Write a template function that takes three arguments,
all of the same data type, and which returns their average as
a double.
<P>
6. (10 points) Explain how C++ can let you write two different
functions with the same names.  How can the compiler tell which
function you want to call when it finds a function reference in
your code?
<P>
7. (20 points) Write a complete C++ program that allows a user
to enter words into an array of character strings.  The program
prompts for an array position, reads the position, exits if the
position is negative, issues an error message if the position
is greater than the size of the array, prompts the user for a
word, reads the word, displays the word at the array position
if the word is &quot;show,&quot; and copies the word into the
array at the proper position otherwise.  The program runs until
the user enters a negative position number.  Assume the user makes
no typing mistakes.
