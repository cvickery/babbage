<H1>Errata</H1>

<P>This is a list of typographics errors found in H. M. Deitel and P. J.
Deitel, <i>C++ How to Program</i>, Prentice-Hall, 1994.

<P>This list was compiled from the 7th printing.

<h2>A General Problem</h2>

Throughout the sample programs in the text and on the CD-ROM, the
authors use a construct like this:

<pre>
    for (int i = 0; i < limitVal; i++) {
      ...
      }
</pre>

This code declares the variable <i>i</i> to have block scope
within the <b>for</b> loop, which is fine.  The problem is that the
authors rely on the behavior of older C++ compilers to give <i>i</i>
scope that extends from the <b>for</b> statement onward in the function
in which it appears, even after the end of the loop.  This construct is
no longer valid in current drafts of the C++ standard, and the
<i>g++</i> compiler issues warnings when compiling the code.<P>

The general solution is to declare the loop index at the beginning of
the function definition instead of inside the <b>for</b> statement.<P>

<h2>Errata by Page</h2>
 
<dl>

<dt>Page 134<dd>The quotation should read, "Call <b>me</b> Ishmael."

<dt>Page 223<dd>The comment that references "Fig. 3.10" should reference
Fig. 3.8.

<dt>Page 368<dd>The sentence that begins in the eighth line of the first
paragraph in Section 6.11 should start with the word "There" instead
of "The."

<dt>Page 547<dd>The last sentence of the last full paragraph on the page
repeats the last sentence of the previous paragraph.  Omit the second
copy.

<dt>Page 610<dd>The last word of the comment that starts on the seventh
line of Fig 12.3 ("elements") appears at the beginning of the next line.
It should be at the end of line 7.

<dt>Page 620<dd>In the third item in the list of Objectives
change the word "of" to "at."

<dt>Page 625<dd>In the second line from the bottom of the page, change the
word "an" to "and."

<dt>Page 673<dd>It's not really a typographical error, but the function
textFile should close print.txt before returning.  Adding the statement,
<code>outPrintFile.close();</code> just before the last brace in the
function would do it.

<dt>Page 674<dd>The two functions on this page fail to check the validity
of the user's input the way <i>updateRecord()</i> defined on the previous
page does.  In both functions, the statement <code>cin >> account;</code>
should be bracketed by "<code>do { ... } while (account < 1 || account > 100);
</code>"  The code to issue the prompt should be moved inside this loop.

<dt>Page 718<dd>On the first line, change "<b>insertNode</b>" to
"<b>insertNodeHelper</b>."

<dt>Page 758<dd>The ninth line of text from the top of the page says
that <b>value &amp displayMask</b> evaluates to <b>1</b>, but it
evaluates to <b>10000000 00000000</b>.  However, he logic of the
program is correct, because <i>any</i> non-zero value is treated as
"true" when C++ evaluates logical expressions.

<dt>Page 764<dd>In the "Type" column of Fig. 16.13 change "negation" to
"bitwise exclusive OR" or "bitwise XOR."
