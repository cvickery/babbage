<h1 align=center>Grading Form for Knight's Tour Project</h1>

<h2>NOTE</h2>
<blockquote>
     Each section of this report is followed by a score in the form
     "m/n" which tells is your score and the maximum fpossible or the
     section.  The maximum score for the project is the sum of the "n"
     values for all sections, which is 10.  Each question within a
     section is followed by a number in parentheses, which tells how
     many points are deducted <i>if</i> the answer to the question is "no." 
     The numbers in parentheses add up to more than the maximum score
     for a section because there is more than one way to lose points
     within a section!

<h2>User Documentation:</h2>
<blockquote>

     Is there a user documentation file? (1.0)<p>

     Is the user documentation file named tour.1? (0.3)<p>
     
     Does the user documentation file look like a "man" page.  That is,
     does it have (at least) sections called Name, Synopsis, and
     Description, and do those sections contain the type of information
     that a <i>user</i> would need to know to use the program? (0.5)<p>

     Is the writing clear, concise, and grammatically correct? (1.0)<p>
     
      Score:    /1.0<p>

<h2>Coding Style:</h2>
<blockquote>

     Is the code easy to read?  Indentation should be consistent,
     there should be enough whitespace to make the code and comments
     easy to see. (1.0)<p>
     
     Does the program use meaningful variable names? (1.0)<p>
     
     Are sequence, selection and repetition structures used
     appropriately and efficiently? (1.0)<p>

     Are the comments a useful guide to the code, written so they will
     be useful to another programmer who knows how to program in C++,
     but who needs to locate key parts of the code? (1.0)<p>

      Score:    /3.0<p>
</blockquote>


<h2>Project Structure and Functionality:</h2>
<blockquote>


     Did the student provide all three modules, named tour, heuristic,

     Do all three modules compile and link without error to each other
     and to the modules we supplied? (3.0)<p>
     
     Do all the executable versions of the program produce "reasonable"
     results? (2.0)<p>
