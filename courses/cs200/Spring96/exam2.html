<BODY>

<P>
1. Assume the variable <I>arrayName</I> is to be an array of 12
bytes.
<OL>
<LI>Write a statement that declares <I>arrayName</I> to be of
type <I>char </I>and reserves memory for the array.
<LI>Write a statement that reserves memory for a pointer to a
character.
<LI>Write two different statements that store the address of the
first (zeroth) element of <I>arrayName</I> in the pointer variable
you defined in answer B.
<LI>Write a statement that uses your pointer variable to store
the value <TT>'a'</TT> into the first element of <I>arrayName.</I>
<LI>Write a statement that makes your pointer variable point to
the next element of the array.
<LI>Which of these string constants should <I>not</I> be copied
into <I>arrayName</I>:
<UL>
<LI><TT>&quot;1234567890A&quot;</TT>
<LI><TT>&quot;1234567890AB&quot;</TT>
<LI><TT>&quot;1234567890ABCD&quot;</TT>
</UL>

<LI>Write a statement that uses <I>strcpy()</I> to copy the string
<TT>&quot;ABC&quot;</TT> into <I>arrayName</I>.
<LI>Write a function prototype for <I>strcmp().</I>  (String compare.)
</OL>

<P>
2. Assume an <I>int</I> uses four bytes of memory, a pointer uses
eight bytes, and a character uses one byte.
<OL>
<LI>Write a definition of a <I>struct</I> named <I>nodeElement</I>
that holds an integer named <I>value,</I> a pointer to a string
named <I>name,</I> and a pointer to a <I>nodelement </I>named
<I>next.</I>
<LI>Write a statement that defines an array of 15 <I>nodeElement</I>s.
<LI>How much memory does this array occupy?  (Assume no &quot;filler&quot;
or &quot;padding&quot; bytes are needed.)
<LI>Write statements to assign the <I>name, value, </I>and<I>
next</I> fields of the second element of your array with <TT>&quot;hello&quot;</TT>,
<TT>23</TT>, and the address of the last element of your array,
respectively.
<LI>Write a statement that defines a pointer to a <I>nodeElement.</I>
<LI>Write statements to make the same assignments as in answer
D, but use the variable that you defined in answer E.  That is,
assume the pointer contains the address of a <I>nodeElement, </I>and
use the pointer to access the fields.
</OL>

<P>
3. Assume you need to debug a program named <I>buggy.</I>
<OL>
<LI>What is the command line to start your debugging session using
<I>gdb</I>?
<LI>Assume you know the problem is in a function named <I>theProblem().</I>
 What is the most efficient way to get the program to execute
until it reaches that function.  (Give the <I>gdb</I> commands
you would use.)
<LI>Once you get to <I>theProblem(),</I> how can you execute one
statement at a time?
<LI>How can you examine the value of a variable?
<LI>How do you end your debugging session?
</OL>

<P>
4. Write the statements that should be put into a header file
named <TT>myclass.h</TT> so that the preprocessor will not #include
all the statements in the header file recursively.
<P>
5. Write the declaration for a class named <I>myClass</I> that
has a private integer data member named <I>value, </I>a constructor
that initalizes <I>value</I> and to <B>-1</B> (negative one) by
default, and three public member functions, one to set the value
of <I>value,</I> and one to return the value of <I>value,</I>
and one to print the value of <I>value.</I>  Your declaration
must be consistent with the remaining parts of this question.
 The following statements are to be written as they would appear
in a driver program, not in the class definition.
<OL>
<LI>Write a declaration of a two objects, <I>obj_1 </I>and <I>obj_2,</I>
of class <I>myClass</I>.  One is to be initialized to the default
value, and one is to be initialized (by the constructor) to zero.
 Both objects are to be variables.
<LI>Write a declaration of two objects, <I>obj_a</I> and <I>obj_b,</I>
which are constants whose <I>value</I> members have the values
3 and 5, respectively.
<LI>Write a statement that assigns the value of <I>obj_a</I> to
<I>obj_1</I>.
<LI>Write a statement that adds the value of <I>obj_b</I> to <I>obj_2.</I>
<LI>Write a statement that prints the value of <I>obj_b.</I>
<LI>Write code that would cause the following sequence of function
calls: the constructor for <I>myClass, main(),</I> and then constructor
for <I>myClass</I> again.
</OL>
