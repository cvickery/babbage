<P>
1. [15 points] Write a complete header file for the <I>String</I>
class based on the example used in Chapter 8 of the textbook.
 Your class declaration is to include all data members, but only
the following function declarations.  <I>Do not write any function
definitions yet!</I>
<OL>
<LI>A default constructor that takes no arguments.
<LI>A constructor that takes a pointer to a C string as an argument.
<LI>The assignment operator (=).
<LI>A string concatenation operator (+=) that has a <I>String</I>
object as its right operand.
<LI>Another string concatenation operator (+=) that has a C string
as its right operand.
<LI>A stream insertion operator.  (<I>Not</I> a stream extraction
operator!)
</OL>

<P>
2. [5 points] What must you do immediately after you invoke the
<I>new</I> operator in a C++ program, and why?
<P>
3. [10 points] Write the C++ code to do the following:
<OL>
<LI>Allocate enough memory to hold a new C string, assuming the
variable <I>some_string</I> is a pointer to an existing C string
that will later be copied into the new string.  The newly-allocated
memory is to be accessible using the variable <I>another_string.</I>
<LI>Copy the string pointed to by <I>some_string</I> into the
memory allocated for <I>another_string.</I>
<LI>Free the memory that was allocated in answer 3<I>a.</I>
</OL>

<P>
4. [5 points] Explain how the C++ operator that frees memory for
an array (as in 3<I>c</I>) can determine how much memory is to
be freed.
<P>
5. [10 points] Write the function definition for answer 1<I>d</I>
(the String concatenation operator with a String object as right
operand).
<P>
6. [10 points] Assume the class Complex has been defined as in
the exercises for Chapter 8.  Write a complete <I>main()</I> function
that prompts the user to enter a Complex number (indicate the
proper format for the number in the prompt), input the Complex
number, multiply it by the complex number (3.4 + 4.5<I>i</I>),
and display the result.
<P>
 Your <I>main()</I> function must include all variable declarations,
and must use overloaded operators for input, multiplication, and
output.
<P>
7. [15 points] Assume <I>Base</I> is a base class, and <I>Derived</I>
is derived from <I>Base</I>.  Given the following code:
<P>
<TT>Base  baseObj, *basePtr;</TT>
<P>
<TT>Derived derivedObj, *derivedPtr;</TT>
<OL>
<LI>[4 points] Insert the proper <I>cast</I> so that both the
following statements will compile without any warnings:<BR>
 <TT>basePtr = &amp;derivedObj;<BR>
 derivedPtr = &amp;baseObj;</TT>
<LI>[7 points] Explain your answer to part 7<I>a</I>.  Include
a brief definition of base and derived classes in this answer.
<LI>[4 points] What is the effect of the cast in part 7<I>a</I>
on the binary representation of the address that is assigned to
the pointer variable?
</OL>
