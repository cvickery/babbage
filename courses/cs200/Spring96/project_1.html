<h2>What and When</h2>
<dl>

<dt><b>Due Date:</b><dd>This assignment is due on the date of
<A href="../Syllabus/class_7.html">Class 7</a> for your section.
Consult that syllabus page for your section's meeting date.<P>

Note that the due date is the class following your first exam
for the course.  The exam will be based in part on the project,
in the sense that working on the project is a good way to review
for the exam.<P>

<dt><b>Deliverables:</b><dd>Send a <i>tar</i> file of your "clean"
project directory, containing a Makefile, your source code files, and a
text file containing a project report.  See the <a
href="../using_unix/project.html">Project Management</a> web page for
information on making a clean project directory and submitting the
assignment.  See the <a href="#report"> Project Report</a> section
below for information about the report.

<h2><a name="description">Project Description</a></h2>

This project is based on, but is not the same as, Exercises 4.24 and
4.25 in the textbook.  Read those two exercises carefully before working
on the project.<P>

You are to write two functions that use different algorithms to solve
the chess problem known as the <i>Knight's Tour</i> and a driver
program that exercises the two algorithms.  One function, which is to
be named <i>brute()</i>, is to implement the brute-force algorithm
described in Exercise 4.25, and the other function, which is to be
named <i>heuristic()</i>, is to implement the algorithm described in
Exercise 4.24c.  You may also implement the algorithm described in
Exercise 4.24d if you wish, but it is not expected, and is not
required.<P>

The two functions for the two algorithms are both to take an <i>int</i>
between 0 and 63 indicating the square on which to start the tour, and
are to return an <i>int</i> between 0 and 63 telling how many moves were
made before the tour could continue no further.  You may map the starting
square number to a particular cell on the board any way you wish as long
as each value maps onto a different square.<P>

The main program is to call each algorithm some large number of times,
such as 64,000, and is to count how many tours of each length each algorithm
makes.  Each tour should start on a different square, so the
number of times each function is called should be a multiple of 64.<P>

The main program is also to determine the average time it takes the
two algorithms to perform a tour and to make a single move.  We are
providing you with two functions, <i>startTiming()</i> and <i>stopTiming()</i>,
for you to use to make the timing measurements.<P>

The functions <i>main()</i>, <i>brute()</i>, and <i>heuristic()</i>
must each be defined in its own source file.  The names of the source
files must be <code>tour.cc</code>, <code>brute.cc</code>, and
<code>heuristic.cc</code> respectively.<P>

<h2><a name="files">Files Supplied to You</a></h2>

The directory <code>~vickery/CS-200/Project_1</code> contains several
files you will use to help develop the project.  Begin work on the project
by creating your own project directory and copying all the files in Dr.
Vickery's project directory into it.  If you type the command, <i>make</i>,
a complete executable version of the project will be built.  The name
of the executable file will be <i>tour</i>.<P>

This <i>tour</i> program outputs more than a screenful of information, so
you might want to capture its output in a file:

<pre>
     $ tour > tour.out
</pre>

In this case, the output from the <i>tour</i> command has been
redirected to the file named <code>tour.out</code>, which you can
examine with <i>more</i> or a text editor.  Refer to the <a
href="../using_unix/commands.html#redirection">Using Unix</a> web
page if you are not familiar with I/O redirection.<p>

Also, this <i>tour</i> program accepts the number of tours each algorithm
is to run as an optional command line argument:

<pre>
     $ tour 64 > tour.out
</pre>

Your program is <i>not required</i> to take a command line argument.<P>

Each of the files given to you is described here:

<dl>

<dt><code>Makefile</code><dd>This is a copy of the default
<code>Makefile</code> for this course
(<code>~vickery/CS-200/Makefile</code>) which has been tailored to this
project.<p>

You do not need to modify this file, but it needs to be present for
the <i>make</i> command to work properly as you work on the project.<p>

Here is an overview of what <i>make</i> will do when this Makefile is
in your project directory:<p>

<blockquote>

Among other things, the Makefile contains a
list of <i>targets</i>, which are the names of files or operations that
you might want to "make."  The targets in this Makefile are named <i>tour</i>,
<i>testTiming</i>, <i>clean</i>, and <i>depend</i>.  Since <i>tour</i> is
the first target specified in the Makefile, that is the one that is made
by default when you type the <i>make</i> command with nothing else on
the command line.<p>

The rule for making <i>tour</i> in the Makefile is to execute the command:

<blockquote>
<pre>
g++ -g tour.o board.o brute.o heuristic.o timing.o -o tour
</pre>
</blockquote>

Remember, you don't type in this command, you type "<i>make</i>" and
<i>make</i> executes this command for you.<p>

As you should know from class, this command doesn't cause anything
to be compiled because only <code>.o</code> files are listed.  The
compiler driver just links all the files listed with the standard
library and produces an executable file named <code>tour</code>.<p>

The power of <i>make</i> is that before executing the command above it
will check if there are any files with <code>.cc</code> extensions that
might might need to be compiled to produce any of the indicated
<code>.o</code> files.  Thus, when you create your own
<code>brute.cc</code> file in the project directory and execute
<i>make</i>, it will find your file and will also determine that your
file was edited more recently than <code>brute.o</code> was compiled,
and <i>make</i> will automatically create a new <code>brute.o</code> file by
executing this command for you:

<blockquote>
<pre>
g++ -g -c brute.cc
</pre>
</blockquote>

<i>Make</i> will then execute the <i>g++</i> command given earlier to
link all the <code>.o</code> files together.  At this point, the
<code>brute.o</code> file that we supplied to you (see below) will be
replaced by your own file with the same name.  Of course you can always
get another copy of the one we supplied from
<code>~vickery/CS-200/Project_1</code> if you want to.<p>

As you might guess, this description of how <i>make</i> handles
<code>brute.cc</code> and <code>brute.o</code> applies to all the files
in the project.  Since you won't create files named
<code>board.cc</code> or <code>timing.cc</code>, <i>make</i>  will
always link the <code>board.o</code> and <code>timing.o</code> files
that we supplied you.  But as you work on the project (See the <a
href="#strategy">Development Strategy</a> section below), you will
create your own versions of <code>tour.cc</code> and
<code>heuristic.cc</code>, and <i>make</i> will compile and link your
new code as you develop it, even though the only command you ever give
for building the project is just plain <i>make</i>.<p>

</blockquote>


<dt><code>tour.h</code><dd>This header file contains the function
prototypes for <i>heuristic()</i> and <i>brute()</i>.<p>

<b>Note:</b> You <i>must</i> include this file in all three of your
source code files using the <code>#include</code> preprocessor
command.<p>

<dt><code>timing.h</code><dd>This header file contains the function
prototypes for two functions, <i>startTiming()</i> and <i>stopTiming()</i>.
You do not have to write eather of these functions, but you need to call
them from your driver program to do the timing analysis required for this
assignment.  (If you want to look at the source code for these function
definitions, it is available in <code>~vickery/CS-200/timing.cc</code>.)<p>

<b>Note:</b>  You can find out how long a section of code takes to execute
by calling <i>startTiming()</i> before entering the code to be measured
and by calling <i>stopTiming()</i> after the section finishes.  The value
returned by <i>stopTiming()</i> is given in microseconds (millionths of
a second), but the granularity of the clock on qcunix1 is 1/1024 second
(976.56 microseconds), so you will not get a meaningful value unless you
execute a lot of code between the point where you start timing and the
point at which you stop.  For example, if you try to find out time the
execution of one call to your <i>brute()</i> function, you will almost
always get a value of 0.00, and sometimes will get a value of 976.56,
neither of which is correct.  (The correct answer is undoubtedly somewhere
in between.)  On the other hand, if you measure the time it takes to
call <i>brute()</i> 10,000 times and divide the result by 10,000 you
will get a good estimate of the <i>average</i> time per call.<p>

<dt><code>board.h</code><dd>We are supplying some utility functions that
you may or may not choose to use.  If you do use them, you will need this
header file for the function prototypes.  These utilities assume there
are global arrays of <code>int</code> named <code>chessBoard[8][8]</code>
and <code>accessibility[8][8]</code>.  The function <i>clearBoard()</i>
sets each element of <code>chessBoard</code> to zero, the function
<i>printBoard()</i> (which is included only as a debugging aid) prints
the <code>chessBoard</code> array, and the function <i>initAccess()</i>
initializes the <code>accessibility</code> array to the values given
in Exercise 4.24c.<p>

<b>Note:</b>  The functions <i>brute()</i>  and <i>heuristic()</i> that
we are supplying both call <i>clearBoard()</i>, and <i>heuristic()</i> also
calls <i>initAccess()</i>.  Thus, to use the object modules we supply,
you must be sure to link <code>board.o</code> with them.  The main function
that we supply will not call either of these two functions for you, so you
will either have to call them from your own <i>brute()</i> and
<i>heuristic()</i> functions or do those two operations yourself somehow.<p>

<dt><code>tour.o</code><dd>
<dt><code>brute.o</code><dd>
<dt><code>heuristic.o</code><dd>These are pre-compiled versions of the driver
program and the two functions you are to code.  Don't look for the source
code for these modules; writing that is your assignment!

<dt><code>board.o</code><dd>
<dt><code>timing.o</code><dd>These are the object modules for the chessboard
and timing utility functions that you will link to your own object modules.

<dt><code>timingTest.cc</code><dd>This is not really part of the project, it
is a sample program that illustrates the use of the timing utilities.
</dl>

<h2><a name="strategy">Development Strategy</a></h2>

The main reason we are supplying you with object modules is so you won't
have to write all the code for the project at once, which makes debugging
extremely difficult.  Instead, you will develop your program in a
sequence of steps.  During each step you will work on just one source
module at a time, so that you will always have just one place to look
for bugs.  (The other reason for supplying you with object modules is
to give you real-world experience in integrating your code with that
written by other people.)<P>

The first module you should work on is <code>brute.cc</code> because
<i>brute()</i> is simpler to implement than either <i>main()</i> or
<i>heuristic()</i>.  You might want to have your <i>brute()</i> call
<i>printBoard()</i> just before it returns to make sure the tour looks
correct while you are debugging your code.  Your function should use
the global variables <code>chessBoard</code>, <code>horizontal</code>,
and <code>vertical</code> (see below).  <P>

<blockquote>
It is a project requirement that the file containing your <i>brute()</i>
function definition is named <code>brute.cc</code> and that your
<code>brute.o</code> links with the other object modules we provided to
produce an executable program named <i>tour</i>.<P>
</blockquote>

Once you have <i>brute()</i> working, you should write your own version of
<code>tour.cc</code> that exercises both <i>brute()</i> and <i>heuristic()</i>.
You will still use our copy of <code>heuristic.o</code> at this stage.<P>

<blockquote>
As mentioned earlier, your <code>tour.o</code> must
work with our <code>brute.o</code> and <code>heuristic.o</code>, and
your <code>heuristic.o</code> must work with our <code>tour.o</code>.
(If I missed any permutations here, they are required too!)
</blockquote>

<b>NOTE:</b> Your <code>tour.cc</code> will have to define the
following global variables:

<pre>
<blockquote>
int             chessBoard[8][8];
int             accessibility[8][8];
const int       horizontal[8] = {  2,  1, -1, -2, -2, -1, 1, 2 };
const int       vertical[8] =   { -1, -2, -2, -1,  1,  2, 2, 1 };
</blockquote>
</pre> 

Finally, write your own version of <code>heuristic.cc</code>.  You can
receive a passing grade for the project even if you do not complete this
part of the assignment.<P>

<h2><a name="documentation">Documentation Required</a></h2>

There are no strict guidelines for how to document your code.  You must
put some comments at the very beginning that identify the file, what
function(s) is (are) defined in it, and your name.  Beyond that, write
your code so it is neat and easy to read.  Use meaningful variable
names.  Provide comments that introduce the various sections of your
functions, but you do not need to supply line-by-line comments, and you
generally do not need comments about your data.  You can look at
<code>~vickery/CS-200/timing.cc</code> for an idea of how I like to
document code.<p>

Don't forget that you are required to provide a text file that tells
users what your program does and how to use it.  If you have not
already done so, you should look at the <a
href="/courses/cs200/using_unix/project.html">Project Management</a>
web page for information on writing this file, and the <a
href="/courses/cs200/using_unix/project.html#project files">Project
Files</a> section of that page in particular.

<h2><a name="report">Project Report</a></h2>

Let's start with what the Project Report is not.  It is <i>not</i>
a report on programming or on C++.  It is a report that compares
the performance of the two algorithms you implemented for doing
Knight's Tours.<P>

The project report is to be based on the data you collected from your
program.  Even if you are unable to complete the programming assignment
successfully, you will still be able to construct a working program
from the object modules we supplied you and to write your report based
on that.<P>

Write your report in the format of a research paper.  It is to be
submitted as a text file, and should be formatted so it will be easy to
read on the screen.  Do not try to submit a document that you prepared
with a word processor unless you are careful to convert it to the
format of a Unix text file.<P>

The report will be graded on English usage as well as on content, so be
sure to use complete sentences that are gramatically correct with words
spelled correctly.  (You can use the <i>spell</i> command to check your
file for spelling errors.)<P>

The report is not to be very long.  A few sentences for each of the
sections listed below is enough.<P>

<h4>Report Format</h4>

Give the report a meaningful title, which should be centered in the
first line of the file.  Put your name centered on the second line,
and put the day of the week your section meets centered on the third
line.<P>

The report is to have the following sections, each of which is to be
labeled as indicated here:

<dl>

<dt><i>Introduction</i><dd>Describe the purpose of the project in your
own words.  Remember, the purpose of the project as far as the report
is concerned is to measure the performance of the two algorithms.  It
has nothing to do with programming or C++.

<dt><i>Method</i><dd>Summarize the two algorithms and tell how your
main program tested the two algorithms.

<dt><i>Results</i><dd>Summarize the data you collected, but do not interpret
the data.  If you want to get fancy and prepare a table or graph, you may
do so, but nothing like that is required or expected.

<dt><i>Discussion</i><dd>Discuss the results you obtained and draw any
conclusions that are supported by your data.

</dl>

<h2><a name="submit">Submit the Project</a></h2>

You are to submit this assignment by following the instructions given
in the <a href="../using_unix/project.html#submit">Project Management</a>
Web page.  The only files that are to be in your project directory when
you <i>tar</i> it are the <code>.cc</code> files that you wrote, your
<code>tour.1</code> user documentation file, and the text file containing
your report.  It's all right if there is a copy of our <code>Makefile</code>
is there too, since the <i>make clean</i> command will not remove it
automatically.<p>

From this project on, we would like you to use the name of your Unix
account (like "abcqc") as the name of your <i>tar</i> file and to
indicate what assignment you are submitting in the
<code>Subject:</code> line of your mail message.<p>
