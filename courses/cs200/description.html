<H2>Catalog Description</H2>

<P>This is the course description as it appears in the Queens College
course catalog.

<H3>CS-200, C and C++ Programming</H3>

<P>2 hours, 2 credits.  Prerequisite: <A
HREF="http://www.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs103.html">CS-103</A>.
<P>Instruction in and general programming using the C and C++ languages.
Object-oriented design and UNIX.

<H2>More Information</H2>

The catalog description tells what we'd <i>like</i> to cover in this
course, and you will indeed have an opportunity to learn all four topics
(C, C++, object-oriented design, and Unix).  To do so, though, you will
have to do a lot of self-study outside the class using the resources that
we provide you.<p>

What you actually get by taking this course is chance to do a lot of
programming exercises in C++ while working in a Unix development
environment.<p>

C++ is built on the C language, but it is not just a superset of C.  Certain
language constructs have different meanings in C and in C++.  So, rather than
have you learn C, and then have you unlearn parts of it and start learning
C++, we will focus entirely on programming in "pure" C++.  Along the way, we
will point out semantic differences between the two languages, but our focus
always will be on coming up to speed with C++.<p>

Object-oriented design can refer both to a way of approaching problems
and to the use of specialized tools for documenting solutions to problems.
The course will help you to understand the object-oriented view of the
world, but it does nothing to introduce you to object-oriented design
tools and methodologies.  There just isn't enough time for that.<p>

There is a lot of hyperbole associated with object-oriented design
and the C++ language.  The course tries to be objective in its treatment
of these subjects.<p>

<H2>The Development Environment</H2>

Each student in the course has an account on a Unix timesharing
system, <i>qcunix1.acc.qc.edu,</i> which is a Digital Equipment
Corporation dual-processor Alpha computer running Digital Unix, a
version of Unix System V.  Some PCs running Microsoft Windows on campus are
equipped with software that allows you to log into <i>qcunix1</i> using
the X Window System.  The X Window System will provide you with a
graphical user interface to Unix, but your interactions with the system
will be primarily command-line oriented in keeping with the traditional
form of interaction with Unix systems.<p>

You will learn enough about Unix to manage your files, send
and receive mail, use a few of the standard Unix utility programs, and
to compile/test your exercises.  The compiler and debugger programs
you will use are industry standards from the Free Software Foundation
(Project GNU): <i>g++</i> and <i>gdb</i>.  You will also have the use of a
graphical user interface to <i>gdb</i>, called <i>ddd</i>, which comes from
the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig, Germany.<p>

Some students have access to commercial C++ development systems that run under
DOS/Windows (Borland, Microsoft, Watcom, etc.)   All the work that you do for
this course, however, must be developed under Unix using the tools on
<i>qcunix1</i>.  If you do have access to a DOS/Windows development system,
don't use it for this course!  You will spend more time converting a
DOS/Windows program so that it will run under Unix than if you just wrote it
under Unix in the first place.  Besides, the exams for the course will test
your knowledge of the Unix development environment.  If you want to, you can
"port" your exercises for this course back to DOS or Windows, but don't try to
work the other way around.  By the way, a lot of C++ programmers develop
applications for Microsoft Windows.  This course, however, has nothing to do
with developing Windows applications.<p>


<b>Note:</b>  It is possible to dial into <i>qcunix1</i> from off-campus,
but the X Window interface is available only from on-campus PCs because
of the nature of the communication links to the college.<p>
