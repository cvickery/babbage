<H1 ALIGN-center>Accessing Your Unix Account</H1>

This web page gives you some background on the different options you
have for accessing your account on <i>qcunix1</i>.<P>

The two basic ways of accessing your Unix account are called 
<i>command line mode</i> and <i>GUI mode</i>.  Command line mode means
that everything is text based.  You type in characters, and the
computer types characters on your screen.  Command line mode's graphics
capabilities are limited to some use of arrow keys, reverse video, and
some line-drawing capabilities.  "GUI" stands for Graphical User
Interface.  Everyone is probably familiar with either the Microsoft
Windows or the Macintosh GUI, and Unix has its own GUI, called The X
Window System.  GUI applications display their output in windows, and
the user uses a combination of keyboard and mouse for input.<P>

Unix is a timesharing system, which means that you have your own
<i>account</i> that gives you private access to your own part of the
file system, and which also gives you access to the public parts of
the file system where the executable files and developement
tools are kept.<P>

You can access the files in your part of the file system and run
programs (i.e. invoke executable files) either by typing commands into a
program called the <i>shell</i> or by interacting with a GUI file
management program using the mouse and icons on the screen.  However,
With the graphical interface, you can also run a terminal emulator
program in a window, where you can type commands into a shell.  This
means that learning how to use the command line interface will work
whichever way you access your account.<P>

Originally, Unix provided only a command line interface, but about
ten years ago a group of Unix vendors funded a project at MIT, called
Project Athena, to develop a graphical user interface to make the
operating system more productive to use.  The result is called The X
Window System, or "X" for short.  (Calling this user interface "X
Windows," by the way, is considered <i>uncool</i>.)  The original
vendors to support Project Athena included IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and
the company that makes our <i>qcunix1</i> computer, Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC).<P>

You might notice that the developement of a graphical user interface
for Unix parallels somewhat in time a similar effort in the DOS world,
the development of Microsoft Windows.  A big difference between X and
Windows is that X allows you to use a graphical user interface to
access a Unix computer over a network from any computer that supports
the X Window System.  Windows, however, provides a graphical user
interface only on the computer you are sitting at.<P>

The fact is, you can't sit in front of the Unix computer we will be
using the way you would sit in front of a PC.  Our Unix computer is
locked away somewhere in the bowels of I Building, and can only be
accessed remotely.  So, how do you do that?<P>

There are three ways you can gain access to your Unix account:

<ol>

<li>From a "Dumb Terminal" (DT).

<li>From a PC that runs a program that makes it act like a Dumb Terminal

<li>From a PC that knows how to act as a server for the X Window System

</ol>

Alternatives (1) and (2) require a modem connection to
<i>qcunix1</i>.  There are also some DTs available for you to use on campus,
although most of them are due to be replaced by PCs sometime "soon."
If you have a communications program
like Kermit (available for free from the Computer Center), Crosstalk,
or ProComm for your PC, you can use option (2) to dial in to the college
to access your account.
Information on how to do this is available from the Computer Center.<P>

Alternative (3) requires a high-speed link for accessing your account.
The college does not provide any dial-in links to support this option,
but CUNY has recently negotiated a deal with MCI to provide this kind of
access by dialing into an "Internet Service Provider," presumably at a
better price than you can get elsewhere.  However, even at 28.8 Kaud,
running X on your PC would be impractically slow.  What would be more
reasonable would be to run an application like Telnet on your pc, and to
have Telnet access your qcunix1 account over the Internet.  This would
give you a command-line interface to your account instead of an X Window
interface, but you would be working on your PC under Microsoft Windows,
which you might like.  For example, you could log into your account
multiple times simultaneously by running multiple Telnet windows on your
PC, and you could cut and paste between them, or use one for editing and
another for compiling and testing your program.<P>

You can use the X Window System to access your account if you want to,
though: There are PCs in I Building with Ethernet links to
<i>qcunix1</i> that that will work.  The reason it works is that Ethernet
operates about 350 times faster than a 28.8 Kbaud modem.  The gory
details on doing this are given back on the <a

There are two reasons that we are providing you with an X Window
interface to Unix.  The first is simply so that you can become familiar
with it as part of your general computer science education.  The second
is that it allows the possibility that we will be able to give you
assignments that involve developing GUI programs.  Unfortunately, there
will not be enough time to do such exercises in this course.<P>
