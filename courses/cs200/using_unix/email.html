<H1 ALIGN=center>Using E-Mail</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

This page tells you how to use your <i>qcunix1</i> account to send and
receive electronic mail.  You can use e-mail to interact your
instructor without the constraint scheduling a meeting during regular
office hours.  In addition, we will use e-mail to make announcements to
the entire class, so be sure to read you e-mail regularly.<P>

The program you will use read, compose, and send e-mail messages is called
<i>pine.</i>  There are several such programs available for Unix, but
<i>pine</i> is relatively easy to use, has a lot of good features, and
is a command line program, which means you don't have to be using the
X Window System to use it.  (Besides, the X Window program that is
available doesn't have as many features.)<P>

To become familiar with the e-mail system, you should use it to send mail
to yourself a few times and to read the messages you sent.<P>

<H2>E-mail Addresses</H2>

Your e-mail address consists of two parts separated by the '<code>@</code>'
character.  The first part is your Unix account ID, and the second part
is the Internet hostname for the computer where you have your account, namely
<code>qcunix1.acc.qc.edu</code>.  Anyone in the world who knows your
e-mail address and has access to the Internet can send you e-mail, and
vice-versa.<P>

When you send e-mail to someone else who has an account on qcunix1.acc.qc.edu,
you can use just the user's account name without the '<code>@</code>' or
the hostname.<P>

You might encounter the phrase, "Fully Qualified Domain Name" (FQDM).  It just
means the hostname with all the dotted parts in place.  Your account is on
the <i>host</i> <code>qcunix1</code>, which is in the Academic Computer
Center (acc) domain in the Queens College (qc) domain in the Educational
Institution (edu) domain.  The FQDM for the computer in Dr. Vickery's
office is <code>babbage.cs.qc.edu</code>.  The host is named babbage, and
it is in the Computer Science Department (cs) domain of Queens College (qc)
in the edu domain.<P>

<H2>Starting Pine</H2>

Start pine by typing <i>pine</i> and the shell prompt.  The screen will clear,
some information will be displayed, and there will be a menu of command
characters at the bottom of the screen.  The first time you run pine, you
will be asked if you would like to get e-mail telling you how to configure
the program.  It's a good idea to say yes.<P>

Because of the variety of ways you can configure pine, we won't describe
what you will see on the screen because it won't be the same for everyone.
Instead, we will just tell you what command to use to perform various
operations.<P>

<H2>Sending Mail</H2>

Use the Compose command to create a message.  (Type '<code>c</code>'.)
The top part of the screen will show the <i>headers</i> for the message,
which include lines for "To:" and "Subject:".  Type the address of the
person to whom you want to send the mail on the "To:" line, and a brief
statement of what the message is about in the "Subject:" line.  Do not
send mail messages without a meaningful Subject: line because it makes
it harder for the recipient to process incoming messages.  It is
especially important to remember this when sending messages to the
person who is going to assign you a grade in the course!<P>

There may be other lines displayed in the Header section of your message,
but you may safely ignore them all.  (There is configuration option that
makes them not show up.)<P>

Use the arrow key to move below the Header section into the "Message Text"
section and type in the message you want to send.  If you look, you will
see that the menu choices at the bottom of the screen change when you
go into the Message Text section because you will have entered a text
editor.  Unless you configure pine differently, the editor you will be
using to compose messages will be <A HREF="editing.html#pico">pico</a>,
which is the same editor your can invoke directly from a command line
prompt to edit your program files if you wish.<P>

When you finish composing your message, type '<code>^X</code>' (That's
the character '<code>X</code>' while holding the <code>Ctrl</code>
key.)  Pine will ask you to confirm that you want to send the message,
which you do by typing '<code>Y</code>' or '<code>y</code>.'  (Unlike
the rest of the Unix world, <i>pine</i> commands are not case sensitive.)<P>

When you send a message, a copy of it will be made in a file named
<code>sent-mail</code> in your <code>~/Mail</code> directory.  Pine
will create this directory for you the first time you run it, and it
will create the <code>sent-mail</code> file the first time you send a
message.  This feature means that there is no need for you to mail
yourself a copy of the messages that you send to others.  You will
see how to get back to these saved messages below.<P>

<H2>Receiving Mail</H2>

When someone sends you mail, the system puts it into your "incoming
mailbox," which is a file in the <code>/var/spool/mail</code> directory
with the same name as your User ID.  When you start up pine you will
see a list of all the mail messages that are in your incoming mailbox.
If you don't see the list, you will have to type the '<code>l</code>'
command to display it.  (You can configure pine to do this
automatically when it starts up by configuring the
"initial-keystroke-list" option.)<P>

Use the up and down arrow keys to select the message you want to read,
and press '<code>Enter</code>' to see the contents of the message.<P>

The secret to using e-mail effectively is figuring out what to do with a
message after you have read it.  There are several options available to
you, which are not all mutually exclusive.  You can select any of these
options either while you are looking at the message itself or while it
is selected in your list of messages.<P>

<blockquote>
<dl>
<dt>D - Delete the message.<dd>The message doesn't really go away until
you exit <i>pine</i>, so you can do other things with it after marking
it for deletion.
<dt>U - Undelete the message.<dd>In case you didn't mean to press
'<code>D</code>'.
<dt>R - Reply to the message.<dd>This is a quick way to compose a message
with the To: and Subject: headers all filled in for you.  The original
message will be copied into your reply for reference purposes.  It's a
good idea to delete the irrelevant parts of the original message so the
other person can figure out what part of it your reply pertains to.
<dt>S - Save the message.<dd>If you don't save or delete the message it
stays in your incoming mailbox.  This is fine until you get a bunch of
old messages sitting in there and it makes spotting the new ones
difficult.  When you save a message, pine asks you for the name of
a "folder," and you type in the name of a file where you want to save
that message.  The file will be created in your <code>~/Mail</code>
directory (if it does not already exist), along with your
<code>sent-mail</code> folder.  You can create different folders for mail from
different people, or whatever scheme you like.  When you want to look
at the messages in a folder, use ...
<dt>G - Go to folder<dd>Use this to select a folder of messages to
work with.  If you want a list of your folders, use the '<code>^T</code>'
command after you type '<code>g</code>'.
<dt>E - Extract the message<dd>Use this command to copy the message to
a file in your home directory instead of (or in addition to) into one
of the folders in your Mail directory.  This option is useful for saving
messages that you want to look at some other way than by using pine.  An
example would be the message that pine mails to you telling you how to
configure pine.
</dl>

<H2>Exiting Pine</H2>

Exit pine by typing '<code>q</code>'.

<H2>Menus and Help</H2>

You can type commands that don't appear at the bottom of the screen.  You
can cycle through all the commands that are available with the '<code>o</code>'
command.  You can always get help by typing '<code>?</code>'.<P>

<H2>Configuring Pine</H2>

If you said "yes" when pine asked about sending you information about
itself, you will receive an e-mail message that tells you about the
various configuration options that are available.  This is a good
document to have if you want to change pine's behavior in any way.<P>

You configure pine by going to the Main menu (type '<code>m</code>') and
selecting "Setup."  From there you select "Config" and set or change
the configuration options you want.  Even without the documentation that
gets sent to you, you can probably figure out what most of the options
do from their names.  Don't be afraid to experiment.<P>
