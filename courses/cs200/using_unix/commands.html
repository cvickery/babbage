<H2><A NAME="shell">1. Using the Shell to Enter Commands</A></H2>

Command lines are processed by a program called the <i>shell</i>.  Unix
has traditionally provided a number of shell programs, each with its
own syntax rules and special set of features.<P>

All Unix systems provide
a basic shell called the Bourne Shell, which is in
<code>/bin/sh</code>.  An extension to the Bourne Shell is the Korn
Shell, which is in <code>/bin/ksh</code>.  (These two shells are named for
the people who wrote them.)  An alternate to <i>sh</i> and <i>ksh</i>
that is based on certain features of the C language is called the "C
Shell," which is in <code>/bin/csh</code>.  Finally, the C Shell has
been extended, notably to make better use of the arrow keys during
command entry, in the T-C Shell, which is in <code>/bin/tcsh</code>.<P>

It's the <i>tcsh</i> that you will be using to enter commands when
you use your Unix account.<P>

It's possible to change your default shell, but it's not a good idea
because we will assume you are using <i>tcsh</i> in all the examples we
give in this course.  However, if you want to experiment with the other
shells you can execute them just like any other Unix command.  For
example, to try the Korn shell, just type "<i>ksh</i>" at a
shell prompt.  You exit a shell by typing the <i>exit</i> command.<P>

The shell is the program that issues a prompt string at the beginning
of a line, waits for you to enter a command, executes the command, and
issues the prompt for you to enter the next command.  The prompt string
you will see is "<code>qcunix1> </code>" and, like everything else, can
be changed to suit your preferences.  For the examples of shell commands
we will use "<code>$ </code>" to mean whatever prompt string you have
set up.<P>

Each command line begins with the name of a command, optionally followed
by command line arguments, and optionally followed by various operators.
Spaces are used to separate the elements of the command line.<P>

When you are typing a command to the <i>tcsh</i>, you can use the up
and down arrow keys to scroll through the history list of commands you
have previously entered that the shell maintains. Use the left and
right arrows to move around within a command line, use
<code>&lt;Backspace&gt;</code> to erase characters, or just type new
characters into the middle of the line, and press
<code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code> to run the command.<P>

A command name is either the name of an executable file or the name of
a command that is executed directly by the shell itself.  (You can set
up <i>aliases</i> for command names, but we will ignore that for now.) When
you type in a command line, the shell reads it and examines the first word.
If it is the name of a built-in command, the shell executes it
directly, and then issues a prompt for you to type another command.  If it
is not the name of a built-in command, the shell searches a number of
standard directories until it finds an executable file with the same
name, and then executes the file.  When the file finishes executing,
the shell issues a prompt for another command.  The message <code>"command
not found"</code> means the command name was neither a shell built-in command
nor the name of an executable file in any of the standard
directories.<P>

The list of directories that the shell searches to find executable
files is called the <i>search path</i>.  Setting up the search path is
an example of a built-in command.  It's one of the commands that is
executed automatically when you log in and the shell starts
executing.  The shell processes all the command lines in the file
<code>~/.cshrc</code> whenever it starts running, and also processes
the commands in <code>~/.login</code> when you first log in.  See
<A HREF="#pathnames">Pathname Syntax</A> for an explanation of these
file names.<P>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="special">Continuation Lines and Background Commands</A></H3>

Two special features of Unix shells are (1) you can continue a command
from one line to the next by typing a \ character at the end of the
first line, and (2) you can run a command in the background by
terminating the command line with an &amp; character.  While the
background command is still running, the shell issues another prompt on
the screen so you can enter more command lines.  You can have pretty
much any number of commands running in the background at the same
time.<P>

<b>Note:</b> If you log out of your account while a command is running
in the background, it continues to run forever!  This will <i>not</i>
endear you with the people who administer <i>qcunix1</i>, to say the
least.  The <i>jobs</i> command (a <i>tcsh</i> built-in command) will
tell you if you have any background commands running, and the
<i>kill</i> command can be used to get rid of background commands.<P>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="redirection">I/O Redirection</A></H3>

<i>Note:</i>  This topic might not make much sense if you are not
familiar with the Unix file system yet, but it is presented here
because it is an important feature of all Unix shells.<P>

If you already know about I/O redirection and pipes in DOS, you already
know about I/O redirection and pipes in Unix, since DOS adopted the
same syntax for the same concepts.  Even if you already know about I/O
redirection, it's a good idea to read the material here, since
<i>tcsh</i> includes some features you might not be familiar with.<P>

Unix programs typically read input from the keyboard and write output
to the terminal screen.  You can tell the shell that you want the
program to read its standard input from a file rather than from the
keyboard by <i>redirecting stdin</i>, and you can tell the shell that
you want to write its standard output to a file rather than to the
screen by <i>redirecting stdout</i>. Putting a <code>&lt;</code>
character followed by a file name on the command line redirects stdin,
and putting a <code>&gt;</code> character followed by a filename
redirects <i>stdout</i>.  You can connect <i>stdout</i> from one
program to <i>stdin</i> of another program by putting a <code>|</code>
character between two commands on the same line, which is called a
<i>pipe</i>.  Any number of commands can be piped together on one
command line.<P>

The shell will not allow you to redirect <i>stdout</i> to a file that
already exists.  (There is an option to override this behavior.)
However, you can redirect <i>stdout</i> so that it will be appended to
the end of an existing file by using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> instead of
<code>&gt;</code> as the redirection symbol.<P>

Programs normally write error messages to the <i>stderr</i> output
stream rather than to <i>stdout</i> so that the messages will be seen
by the user even if <i>stdout</i> is redirected to a file or a pipe.
The shell will let you redirect <i>stderr</i> if you want to, though.
The syntax is to use &gt;&amp; instead of &gt; before the output file
name.<P>

In the C++ programs that you write, the <code>cout</code> output stream
is connected to <i>stdout</i>, <code>cerr</code> and <code>clog</code>
go to <i>stderr</i>, and <code>cin</code> comes from <i>stdin</i>.<P>

You can see some examples of I/O redirection when you read the
section on <A HREF="#basic">Basic Commands</A>.

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<h2><A NAME = "basic">2. Some Basic Commands</a></h2>

<h4><A NAME="redirection_examples">I/O Redirection Examples</A></h4>

First, we'll introduce some commands that we can use as examples of I/O
redirection, introduced <A HREF="#redirection">earlier in this
page</A>.<P>

<A NAME="man">The first Unix command you should learn is called
<i>man</i></A>.  All the Unix commands are documented in an on-line
manual, and the <i>man</i> command is used to look at pages in that
manual.<P>

To start with a basic example,

<pre>
     $ man man
</pre>

will show you the <i>man</i> page for the <i>man</i> command itself.
That is, it will tell you how to use the <i>man</i> command.  Try it,
but don't get intimidated by the volume and density of what you see!.
Unix <i>man</i> pages assume you already have a good idea of what you
are doing.  (If you want a gentler introduction to Unix, you might want
to look at the <A HREF="index.html#sobell">Sobell</A> book.<p>)

Remember, in the examples, <code>"$ "</code> represents the prompt that
the shell displays before reading the command line you type in.  In
this example, the first <code>man</code> is the name of the command you
want to run (<i>man</i>) and the second <code>man</code> is a command
line argument, in this case the name of the command you want to know
about.<P>

You get to the next screenful of <i>man</i> output by pressing the
spacebar, or you can quit <i>man</i> by pressing '<code>q</code>'.<P>

Now, let's use I/O redirection to save the output of a <i>man</i>
command in a file.  In this case, you would redirect stdout:

<pre>
     $ man man > man.out
</pre>

Instead of displaying the information on the screen, it will be saved
in a file named <code>man.out</code>.<P>

<A NAME="lp">For an example of input redirection, we'll use the
<i>lp</i> command , which normally prints whatever it reads from the
keyboard (stdin) on the printer.</A>  You can redirect stdin to come
from the a file, though:

<pre>
     $ lp < man.out
</pre>

(This is not a great example because <i>lp</i> would have printed
<code>man.out</code> without doing input redirection if you had
just typed, "<code>lp man.out</code>".)<P>

Finally, you could use a <i>pipe</i> to print the output of a
<i>man</i> command without bothering to build a file:

<pre>
     $ man | lp
</pre>

In this case, the standard output of the <i>man</i> command doesn't
appear on the screen, and it doesn't go to a file.  It is connected
through the pipe dirctly to the input of the <i>lp</i> command, and
gets printed on the printer.<P>

<H3><A NAME="other">Some Other Commands</A></H3>

<h4><a name="more">Scroll Through Text</a></h4>

You have actually seen the next command, named <i>more</i>, because it
was used implicitly by <i>man</i> to control the rate at which its
output scrolls down the screen.  Like <i>lp</i>, <i>more</i> will
process a (list of) files given on the command line, or will read from
<i>stdin</i> if there are no filenames given on the command line.<P>

<i>Example</i>: Scroll through the contents of <code>somefile</code>:

<pre>
     $ more somefile
</pre>

<i>Example</i>: Use a pipe to scroll through a long directory listing
output by an <i>ls</i> command:

<pre>
     $ ls /usr/users | more
</pre>

You can use <i>more</i> to scroll forward or backwards in a file, or to
look for certain words in the file.  Type '<code>?</code>' for help on
these options at the "more" prompt.  Type '<code>q</code>' to quit
<i>more</i> before you get to the end of the file.<P>

<h4><a name="egrep">Search Files by Content</a></h4>

A powerful utility command is <i>grep</i>, and a slightly more powerful
version is <i>egrep</i>.  Use either of these commands to search a file
or a group of files for a string.<P>

<i>Example</i>: Search the files named <code>alpha</code>,
<code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code> for the string "hello
there".

<pre>
     $ egrep "hello there" alpha beta gamma
</pre>

The quotation marks are needed because there is a blank inside the
string.  (Without the quotes the search would be for the word "hello"
inside the files <code>there</code>, <code>alpha</code>,
<code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code>.)<P>

<i>Complicated Example</i>:  Let's say you have a project with several
files in it and you think you sometimes spelled a variable
<code>this_thing</code> and sometimes wrote it <code>thisThing</code>.
The following command will find all occurrences of either string in all
the files in the current directory:

<pre>
     $ egrep "this_*[tT]hing" *
</pre>

The second asterisk in the example is a <i>wildcard</i> that matches
all filenames in the current directory.  The first command line
argument is enclosed in quotes so the shell will not try to expand the
asterisk there into file names.  The first argument is the search
pattern for <i>egrep</i>, and it says to look for "this" followed by
zero or more underscore characters, followed by either a lower or upper
case 'T' followed by "hing."  The name of each file containing a match,
along with all matching lines in the file, will be output.<P>

For more information on <i>egrep</i> (or any other command!) see the
<i>man</i> page.<P>

<h4><a name="find">Search for Files by Name</a></h4>

The <i>find</i> command is a very rich utility, but a fairly
simple version of it can be used to search through an entire
directory tree for files with particular names.

<i>Example</i>: Find "<code>somefile</code>" in my account:

<pre>
     $ find $HOME -name somefile -print
</pre>

<i>Example</i>: Find all C++ files anywhere in the current
directory or below:

<pre>
     $ find . -name "*.cc" -print
</pre>


At this point, it might be a good idea to become familiar with
Unix files and directories so these utilities will make more
sense!<P>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<h2><A NAME="pathnames">3. File Names and Pathnames</A></h2>

Normally, you will create files using an editor such as <i>pico</i>
or <i>vi</i>, but to illustrate the rules for naming files, we
will start with an unconventional way to bring a file into existence.
You can create an empty file with the <i>touch</i> command:

<pre>
     $ touch a_new_file.that_i_touched.but_it_is empty
</pre>

The name of the file that was created by this example is
"<code>a_new_file.that_I_touched.but_it_is</code>".  The example also
created another file, named "<code>empty</code>."  (Most Unix commands
work just as well on a list of file names as on a single one.)  You can
also see that there are two periods in the first file name, and that it
is pretty long.  It is a valid Unix file name, though.<P>

<blockquote> Unix keeps track of the time a which a file was last
modified, which is the most common use for <i>touch</i>.  If you
<i>touch</i> a file that already exists, its modification time is
changed, which can be useful sometimes when using the <i>make</i>
utility that we will be dealing with elsewhere.  You usually create new
files with a text editor, not with <i>touch</i>.  We introduced
<i>touch</i> here so we could talk about file names without having to
deal with the editor.</blockquote>

To look at a list of the files that are in your current directory, use
the <i>ls</i> command.  All by its self, <i>ls</i> just lists the names
of all the files, but there are <i>command line arguments</i> that
alter the output of the command.  For example,

<pre>
     $ ls -l
</pre>

will give a "long" listing that includes the name of the file, its
size, when it was last modified, and its permissions.  (You shouldn't
have to worry about permissions for a while, but it is an important
feature of the Unix file system.)<P>

<blockquote> There is an old joke about two Unix users who were
discussing how arcane the system can be.  In particular, they were
arguing about how many different meanings a period character has in
Unix.  One claimed there were 47 different uses for the period, and the
second claimed there were 48.  They argued for a long time until the
first said in exasperation, "OK, you'll just have to list all your 48
ways."  "Well," the second one said, "first, you can put one at the end
of a sentence, ..." "Stop, stop," the first user said, "you're right.
I forgot about that one!"  Well, you are about to see your first three
uses of periods in Unix.</blockquote>

Many times there are a lot of files in a directory that you really
aren't interested in.  For your convenience, any file that has a name
beginning with a period is invisible to the <i>ls</i> command ...
unless you use the "-a" argument line option, which tells <i>ls</i> to
list <i>all</i> files in the directory.  You can use the "-a" option
alone or in conjunction with other options.  For example, you can get a
long listing of all files using either of the following two commands:

<pre>
     $ ls -la
     $ ls -l -a
</pre>

The next two uses of periods in Unix are "." and ".." which are the
names for the current directory and its parent, respectively.  Assuming
you know about files and directories in DOS, you know the idea of files
and directories in Unix.  The main differences between a DOS filesystem
and a Unix filesystem are:

<ul>

<li>When you type a pathname in DOS you use a '\' (backslash) character
to separate parts of the path.  In Unix you use a '/' (forward slash)
character to do the same thing.

<li>DOS filenames are limited to 8 characters, a period, and a 3
character extension.  As you saw earlier, Unix allows long pathnames
and puts no restrictions on how many periods there are in a file name
or how many characters follow a period.

<li>DOS provides a few bits of attibute information about files:
read-only, hidden, system, and archived.  Unix provides read, write,
and execute <i>permission</i> bits for the file <i>owner</i>, the
owner's <i>group</i>, and <i>others</i>.

</ul>

There are other important differences, but these are the most obvious
ones to a user.<p>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<H3><A NAME="home">Home Directory Names</A></H3>

When you log in, a unique pathname identifies your <i>home
directory</i>, which is where files will be created unless you use the
<A HREF="#mkdir"> <i>cd</i> command</A> to change your <i>current
working directory</i>.  For example, the pathname to Dr. Vickery's home
directory is <code> /usr/users/vickery</code>.  If your user name is
"abc1qc" your home directory will be <code>/usr/users/abc1qc</code>.<P>

All the sample code from the textbook is available in the directory
<code>CS-200/Examples</code> in Dr. Vickery's account.  You can refer
to this directory using either the full pathname, <code>
/usr/users/vickery/CS-200/Examples</code> or by using the
<code>~</code> (tilde) character to get the shell to supply the
pathname to Dr. Vickery's home directory for you:
<code>~vickery/CS-200/Examples</code>.<P>

You can refer to your own home directory in three different ways:

<ul>

<li>The characters <code>~/</code> at the beginning of a pathname refer
to your home directory.

<li>The environment variable <code>$HOME</code> refers to your home
directory.  Unfortunately, setting and referencing environment
variables is beyond the scope of this Web page.

<li>The sequence <code>~&lt;user ID&gt;</code> refers to your home
directory if you substitute your own account name for <code>&lt;user
ID&gt;</code>.  This is just the general case of the example given for
accessing Dr. Vickery's home directory.

</ul>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="mkdir">4. Creating and Using Directories</A></H2>

Create a subdirectory of your current working directory with the
<i>mkdir</i> command.  Remove a directory with the <i>rmdir</i>
command.  Use the <i>cd</i> command to make another directory the
current working directory.  The <i>cd</i> command with no command line
arguments will make your home directory the current working directory
no matter where your current working directory is at the time you issue
the command.<P>

You can use the <i>pwd</i> command to display the full pathname of your
current working directory at any time.  Also, <i>tcsh</i> can put the
last component of the pathname of the current working directory in your
prompt string:

<pre>
     $ set prompt="$USER@qcunix1[%C]> "
</pre>

(Like, $HOME, $USER is a reference to an environment variable, in this
case one that will produce your user ID.)  You could edit this
<i>set</i> command into your <code>~/.cshrc</code> file so that your
prompt string would be set up each time you log in.<P>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="cp">5. Copy, Move, and Delete Files</A></H2>

Use the <i>cp</i> command to copy a file, the <i>mv</i> command to move
or rename a file, and the <i>rm</i> command to remove a file.<P>

The following example copies file <code>abc</code> to <code>def</code>,
moves file <code>ghi</code> into the parent of the current working
directory without changing its name, moves file <code>jkl</code> to the
subdirectory <code>sub</code> (which must already exist) with the new
name <code>mno</code>, and finally removes all files used in the
example:

<pre>
     $ cp abc def
     $ mv ghi ..
     $ mv jkl sub/mno
     $ rm abc def ../ghi sub/mno
</pre>

<b>NOTE:</b> <i>There is no way to "undelete" a file once you have
removed it!</i><P>

For this reason, I strongly suggest that you always use the
"<code>-i</code>" option with the <i>rm</i> command, which causes it to
ask you to confirm each file you ask to remove.  The best way to do
this is to make an <i>alias</i> for the <i>rm</i> command that includes
the <code>-i</code> option.  Type this into your <code>~/.cshrc</code>
file:

<pre>
     alias rm "rm -i"
</pre>

Now, whenever you type the <i>rm</i> command, the shell will add the
<code>-i</code> argument before running the command, and you will
be asked for confirmation before each file is deleted.<P>

<ul>
<li><A HREF="#toc">Return to Table of Contents</A>
</ul>

<H2><A NAME="wild">6. Wildcards</A></H2>

Wildcards for matching file or directory names work a little
differently in Unix from other systems.  The '<code>?</code>' character
substitutes for any single character, and the '<code>*</code>'
character substitutes for any sequence of zero or more characters.
Unlike DOS, periods are part of the filename, not separators.  So, you
can remove all files in the current directory by typing "<code>rm
*</code>" instead of "<code>rm *.*</code>." In fact, "<code>rm
*.*</code>" will remove only those files that have at least one
period in their names.<P>

Square brackets are used to list specific characters or a range of
characters to substitute into potential file names.  For example, the
command, "<code>ls [a-z]*</code>" will list the names of all files in
the current directory that have names starting with a lower case letter
of the alphabet, and not those that start with an upper case letter, a
digit, or any other character.  (Note that the asterisk as a wildcard
matches zero or more occurrences of <i>any</i> character, but as a
pattern match character in <i>egrep</i> it matches zero or more
occurrences of the character that immediately precedes it.)<P>

Wildcards work across subdirectories.  The following example will copy
all source files in all subdirectories that have names starting with a
lower case letter into the directory <code>BACKUPS</code>:

<pre>
     $ cp [a-z]*/*.[ch]* BACKUPS
</pre>
