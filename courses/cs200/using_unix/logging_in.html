<H2><A NAME="getting">Getting Your User ID</A></H2>

<P>Before you <i>access</i> your Unix account, you will have to <i>get</i>
your Unix account!  Go to Room 200 of I Building and use one of the
Express Terminals to find out your account name (user ID).  Be sure
the account is for <i>qcunix1</i>, not <i>qcvaxa</i>.  If there are
any problems, go down the hall to the information desk for help.


<H2><A NAME="background">Background</A></H2>

Things might make more sense if you start by looking at some <A
HREF="background.html">background material on accessing Unix
accounts</A>.  That page will tell you about the various options you
have for accessing your Unix account and will tell you the difference
between <i>command line mode</i> and <i>GUI mode</i>.<P>

<H2><A NAME="in">Logging In</A></h2>

<h4><A NAME="PC">Using a PC in I Building</A></h4>

There are many PCs on campus that have an Ethernet connection
to <i>qcunix1</i>, and you can use any of them to make a command line
mode connection to your account.  Some of the PCs in I Building Room 200
are set up to give you the option of accessing your account in either
command line mode or in GUI mode, so we'll describe how to use those PCs
since they provide the most general case.<P>

At the present time, all the PCs in I-200 are configured
for GUI mode, but only some of them (the AT&T brand PCs) operate with
high-resolution video drivers that make the interface good.<P>

Once you log into a PC you are given a menu of applications that
you can run.  Select <i>Telnet to qcunix1</i> for command line access
to your account, or <i>Windows</i> to bring up Microsoft Windows,
from which you will be able to access your account in GUI mode.<P>

<h4><A NAME="telnet">Using Telnet</A></h4>

When you make a Telnet connection to your account you will be greeted
with some messages followed by a <code>login:</code> prompt.  Type in
your user ID.  Be sure to use the proper case (lower case) because
upper and lower case letters are <i>not</i> interchangeable Unix.  When
prompted for your password, give your college ID number.<P>

At this point you will be logged in, some intial commands will run
automatically, and the shell will issue a prompt for you to enter
commands.  The prompt will be the string "<code>qcunix1> </code>".  You
will be able to change the prompt if you want to, and in the examples we
give, we will use "<code>$ </code>" to represent whatever prompt string you
decide to use.<P>

<h4><A NAME="windows">Using Windows (Microsoft and/or X)</A></h4>

If you select Windows instead of Telnet from the menu on the PC,
Microsoft Windows will start running, and you will see the usual array
of icons, including <i>Netscape</i>, displayed in the "Main" program
group.  One of the minimized program groups will be "eXcursion," which
you should open by double clicking on it.  In that program group you
will find an icon for an application called "qcunix1 terminal." Double
click on the "qcunix1 terminal" icon, and another application called
<i>eXcursion</i> will start up, and you will then be asked for your
User ID and password for your <i>qcunix1</i> account.  Enter them, and
the next thing you will see will be a Microsoft Windows window that
contains an X Window System window that is running the <i>dxterm</i>
terminal application, which will provide you with a command line
interface to a shell program running on your <i>qcunix1</i> account.
Got all that?<P>

Once <i>dxterm</i> starts running, you will be in exactly the
same situation as if you had logged in using Telnet.  Some initial
commands will run automatically, and you will get your "<code>qcunix1>
</code>" command prompt.  There is one major difference when you log in
this way, though: You can now run X Window applications on
<i>qcunix1</i> and their windows will show up on your PC's Microsoft
Windows screen.  The secret to all this is eXcursion, which is an X
Window System server that runs under Microsoft Windows.<P>

For example, if you want to run two terminal sessions at the same time,
it's no problem.  Just type "dxterm &" at your <i>qcunix1</i> command
prompt and another window running another copy of <i>dxterm</i> will
show up on your screen.  Use the mouse to click on the window you want
to work in.  Also, if eXcursion is set up properly, you will be able to
use <code>Alt-&lt;tab&gt;</code> to switch between dxterm windows.
(Experiment with the left and right <code>Alt</code> keys:  eXcursion
should let Microsoft Windows know when you press one of them, and let X
Window applications know when you press the other.)<P>

Some other X Window applications you might want to try are "xlogo" and
"nedit."  You can use <i>nedit</i> to edit files as easily as
you can with <i>pico</i>, and you can use the mouse to make editing
even easier.<P>

<h4><A NAME="dialing">Dialing in</A></h4>

You can make a command line connection to your account from off-campus
provided you have a modem and either a VT-100 compatible terminal or a
terminal emulation program running on a PC.  The Kermit terminal emulation
program is available from the computer center.<P>

The telephone number to dial is 718-997-5042.  (2400 baud).  When you get
the "Enter Desitination" prompt, type "qcunix1" and you will be able to log
in as described above.  Except for the low baud rate, your access to your
account will be the same as if you had chosen "Telnet" from one of the
PCs on campus.<P>

<H3><A NAME="password">Set Your Password!</A></H3>

Your account can be accessed from any computer in the world that is on
the Internet, and there are other people who would like to have access
to it.  Some of those people want to cause mischief, and some might want
to take your work and claim it is their own.  It's important to keep
your account private.<P>

The only way to protect your account is to use a password
that is as secure as possible.  You set your password with the <i>passwd</i>
command.  First, decide on the password you are going to use.  It has
to be easy for you to remember and to type, but it has to be hard for
anybody else to guess.  There are lots of rules about how <i>not</i> to
choose a password: Don't use people's names or anything based on your
User ID, don't use birthdays or other things based on dates, days of
the week, etc.  One popular form of password that is hard to guess
combines two simple, but unrelated, words with a punctuation mark or
number between them.  Like everything else in Unix, your password is
case-sensitive, and mixing upper and lower case letters can help make
a password more secure.<p>

When you enter the <i>passwd</i> command, it will prompt for your old
password, and will have you enter the new password twice to make sure
you got it right.  If there is any problem with the password you chose,
it will let you know.  Note that the command is "passwd" rather
than "password" -- Unix has traditionally used terse commands to save
typing time.<p>

<h3><A NAME="out">Logging out</A></h3>

You log out of your account by exiting the shell program.  There are three
ways to do this:

<ol>
<li>Type <i>exit</i>.
<li>Type <i>quit</i>.
<li>Type <code>^D</code> (Control-D) at the command prompt.
<li>Hang up the phone if you are logged in through a modem.
</ol>

Method (1) always works.  Method (2) is almost equivalent, except that
it will not work if the shell you are running is not the one that
started up when you logged in.  Unless you run another shell,
methods (1) and (2) are pretty much equivalent.  Method (3) is how
you signal end-of-file in Unix, and if the shell receives that when it tries
to read a command, it interprets it the same as
an <i>exit</i> command.  Method (4) is not a good idea, since there is
a chance that you have programs running that the shell would remind you
about if you log off using one of the other methods.  However, you don't
need to worry about someone else accessing your account if you use
Method (4); you are automatically logged out any time your modem
connection is broken.<P>
