<H1 ALIGN=center>Editing Text Files</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

This page tells you how to edit text files for this course.  It covers
these options:

<ol>
<li>Use <i>pico</i>
<li>Use <i>vi</i>
<li>Use <i>emacs</i>
<li>Use a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Editor
<li>Use a DOS editor
</ol>

<H2><A NAME="pico">pico</A></H2>

Your easiest option is to use <i>pico</i>, the same editor that you will
use to compose e-mail messages in <i>pine</i>.  It's primary virtue is that
there is virtually nothing to learn because it is so simple and because
it always displays a menu of possible commands at the bottom of the screen.<P>

The disadvantages to using Pico are (1) it doesn't include any features to
make it easier to edit program files, (2) it does automatic word-wrap, which
can mess up single line comments without your noticing it, and (3) it
responds slowly to cursor movement keys.<P>

<H2><A NAME="vi">vi</A></H2>

Whatever Unix system you use, you will find <i>vi</i> there.  It's much more
powerful than <i>pico</i>, but you have to learn its commands.  There is
a tutorial program on qcunix1 to teach you the basics of <i>vi</i>: type
"<code>learn vi</code>" at the shell prompt and follow the instructions.<P>

There is a configuration option for <i>pine</i> that will let you use
<i>vi</i> either as the default editor for composing messages or as an
alternative editor that is invoked when you type "<code>^_</code>" in
the Message Text part of the screen.

<H2><A NAME="emacs">emacs</A></H2>

<i>emacs</i> is a very powerful editor that has the virtue of being
programmable.  You can program it to do just about everything you might
want to do with a computer, it seems.  The price you pay for all this
power is a ton of complexity.  Unless you already know it, I don't
recommend trying to use it for this course.<P>

<H2><A NAME="gui">GUI Editors</A></H2>

One disadvantage of <i>pico</i>, <i>vi</i>, and <i>emacs</i> is that
you can't use the mouse to navigate through your text.  If you run one
of the X Window system editors, you can overcome that problem.  On
qcunix1, the X Window editor is called <i>dxnotepad</i>.  How to use it
is pretty self-evident once you get it started.  In addition, if you
start <i>emacs</i> when you are running the X Window System, it runs in
its own window.  (On some other Unix systems, such as Solaris,
<i>emacs</i> under X has a full GUI interface, including drop down
menus, a scroll bar, and full mouse support.  This interface does not
seem to be available on qcunix1 at the time of this writing.)<P>

<H2><A NAME="dos">DOS Editors</A></H2>

You could use a DOS or Windows editor on a PC to edit your text files,
and then transfer the files to your qcunix1 account using Kermit or
(if you have Internet access from your PC) <i>ftp</i>.  If you use this
option, you need to know about the difference between how DOS and Unix
store text files.  Generally speaking, the differences will not effect
your programs, but it is good to know about them anyway, just in case.<P>

A Unix text file is a stream of bytes, with each byte containing the
ASCII code for one character.  The end of each line of text is the
ASCII linefeed character <code>&lt;lf&gt;</code>, which has the numeric
value of decimal ten (written in C++ as the character constant
<code>'\n'</code> or as the hexadecimal constant <code>0x0A</code>).
Strictly speaking <code>&lt;lf&gt;</code> is a control code that causes
the cursor to move down one line on the screen.  There is another ASCII
control code, carriage return <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code> (written
<code>13</code>, <code>'\r'</code>, or <code>0x0D</code> in C++) that
moves the cursor to the left side of the screen.  When you look at a
text file on the screen, the operating system knows enough to output a
carriage return every time is comes to a linefeed in order to make each
line start at the left margin.  DOS uses a different convention for
storing text files.  When you press <code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code>, a DOS editor
puts both <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;lf&gt;</code> into the
file.  (Macintosh, by the way uses the only other possible combination:
it puts just the <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code> into the file when you press
<code>&lt;Enter&gt;</code>.)<P>

DOS editors normally mark the end of a text file with <code>^Z</code>
(hexadecimal 0x1A), but Unix programs such as the compiler normally
ignore <code>^Z</code> and <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code> characters when they
encounter them.  The only thing is, Unix editors try to display the
carriage returns, and they show up as <code>^M</code> characters on the
screen.  You can either delete them manually or ignore them if you
encounter this problem.  (In <i>vi</i> you can remove all
<code>&lt;cr&gt;</code>s from a file by typing
"<code>:%s/^V^M//g</code>" where <code>^V</code> and <code>^M</code>
are control characters.)<P>
