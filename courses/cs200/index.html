Fall 1996 is the second time this course is being offered.  There are three
sections.  If you can't read the table below, you can see a <A href=

The "Syllabus for This Term" is for Dr. Vickery's sections; Mr.
Lusinyants' class will not have the same assignments and may cover the
material in the course in a different sequence, even though all sections
will use the same textbook.<P>

Dr. Vickery's students must attend, and take exams with,
the section in which they are actually registered.<P>

In addition to Dr. Vickery and Mr. Lusinyants, Mr. Joseph Svitak will
be assisting in the management of the course.<P>

<h2><a name="requirements">Course Requirements</a></h2>

There will be two midterm exams and a final which, together, will count
approximately 75% of your course grade.  The other 25% of your grade
will be based on homework assignments and programming exercises.<P>

Although you will spend a lot of time in this course doing the
assignments and exercises, we have purposely made their contribution to
your grade relatively small to encourage you to use them as learning
guides rather than as obstacles that you have to complete "any old way"
to get through the course.<P>

<hr>
<blockquote>
Each student is to do his or her own work for all homework, projects,
assignments, and exams.<p>

Although it is all right to <i>talk</i> with
other students about homework, projects, and assignments, it is not all
right to exchange code, even partially completed code, with another
student either orally, electronically, or otherwise.  Failure to abide
by this policy will result in severe disciplinary action to <i>both
parties</i> involved.

<h2><a name="using">Using Your Unix Account</a></h2>

<P>There will be very little classroom time spent on Unix, but you
must use your Unix account for all assignments this term.  Here is
the material you will need to use your account:

<h2><a name="syllabus">Syllabus</a></h2>

The <A href="Fall96/index.html">syllabus</A> lists the material you
are responsible for each week (reading and homework assignments).  It
also gives an outline of the material covered in each class.<P>

<h2><a name="textbook">Textbook: Paperback and CD-ROM Versions</a></h2>

The textbook for the course is

<blockquote>

<i>C++ How to Program</i> by H. M.  Deitel and P. J. Deitel,
Prentice-Hall, 1994.

</blockquote>

We plan to cover Chapters 1-11 in sequence at a rate of about one
chapter a week.<P>

A list of <A HREF="errata.html">errata for the book</A> is available.
Please let Dr. Vickery know about any others that you find.<P>

Prentice-Hall has also published a multimedia CD-ROM that contains
virtually all of the textbook plus two chapters that are specific to
the C language.  The CD-ROM also includes the source code for all the
examples in the book, executable versions of the examples, an audio
clip for most examples, and a video clip of the authors reading the
preface to the book.  The CD-ROM does not differentiate between
"Self-Review Exercises" and "Exercises" the way the book does.  The
book gives answers to the Self-Review Exercises but not to the other
Exercises.  The CD-ROM includes some answers that are not in the book
and omits some of the answers that are in the book.<P>

The CD-ROM runs on a PC under Windows, and requires a substantial
amount of memory to do everything.  I have a 486 PC with 16 MB of RAM,
and sometimes have to shut down another application to get the
pre-built sample programs to run.<P>

I have copied all the sample code from the CD-ROM into a publicly
readable directory on <i>qcunix1</i>,
<code>~vickery/CS-200/Examples</code>.  There is also a <i>tar</i> file
there named <code>Examples.tar</code> which contains the entire
<code>Examples</code> directory tree.  Note that all of the
<code>.cpp</code> file name extensions have been changed to
<code>.cc</code>, that all ASCII carriage returns have been removed
from the ends of the lines, and that at least some of the files have
been edited to eliminate warnings from the GNU g++ compiler due to
obsolete usage of variable declarations in <i>for</i> statements.<P>

You have a choice of buying the book, the CD-ROM, or both.  There is a
special package price if you buy both.  I think the textbook alone is
satisfactory, but the CD-ROM is of good quality, and you might well
find it useful if you have a computer you can run it on.  I do not
recommend trying to do the course with just the CD-ROM and no copy of
the textbook, but I would like to know how it works out if anyone does
decide to try that option!<P>

<h2><a name="assignments">Assignments and Exams</a></h2>

The <a href="Fall96/index.html">syllabus for the course</a>
gives the reading and homework assignments for this semester.  The
descriptions of longer projects and copies of exams are also available
