<h2>Introduction</h2>

This page shows how a <i>dispatch table</i> can be implemented in C or C++.
A dispatch table is a way of associating a function with a string or
numeric value in a general way.  The concepts illustrated include data
structure initialization, typedefs for functions, and calling functions
through pointers.<p>

The code is taken from a real application, which is described very
briefly here so you can get an idea of what the code is trying to
accomplish.<p>

The application does a random number sampling experiment in order to
test some hypotheses about what strategies people use to estimate
time intervals.  The experimenters who use the program type in the
name of the strategy they want to test, and at one point the program
has to call a different function depending on the name of the strategy
the experimenter typed in.<p>

<h2><a name="dot_h">The <i>sample.h</i> Header File</a></h2>

The name of the header file for this program is <code>sample.h</code>.
There are two sampling strategies, and the header file begins by
setting up symbolic names for numerical constants that can be used
to identify these strategies, plus another constant that should "never"
be used:


<blockquote><pre>
#define UNDEFINED_STRATEGY	0
#define RANDOM_R_STRATEGY	1
#define RANDOM_NR_STRATEGY	2
</pre></blockquote>

As the '<code>#</code>' at the beginning of each line indicates, these
lines are handled by the preprocessor.  Wherever one of the names listed
here appears in a source code file, the preprocessor will substitute the
text that appears on the remainder of the line.  That is, wherever the
program uses the symbol <code>RANDOM_R_STRATEGY</code>, the compiler will
see the character <code>1</code> because of preprocessor text substitution.<p>

<blockquote> In C++ it would have been better to use integer
constants rather than these preprocessor definitions because then the
compiler would be able to check that the symbols are being used
properly as integers.  But I didn't.  In fact, these symbolic
constants were never actually used for anything in this program, but
I have left them in this Web page just to give some idea of how they
<i>might</i> be used.<p> </blockquote>

The program needs to put pointers to functions into a data structure.  The
functions all take two arguments of types <i>int</i> and <i>bool</i> and
return an <i>int</i>, so here is the definition of a new data type for
such functions, and the definition of a structured data type that includes
a pointer to such a function:

<blockquote><pre>
typedef		int chooseDist_t(int, bool);

struct strategy {
  char		*name;
  int		type;
  chooseDist_t	*chooseDist;
  };
</pre></blockquote>

Now the header file can provide the equivalent of function prototypes
for some functions of type <i>chooseDist_t</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
extern chooseDist_t	noStrategy, selRandom_r, selRandom_nr;
</pre></blockquote>

There will be a list of <i>strategy</i> <code>struct</code>s, and as
we shall see, there will be <code>numStrategies</code> elements in this
array:

<blockquote><pre>
extern const strategy	strategyList[];
extern const int	numStrategies;
</pre></blockquote>

<h2><a name="dot_cc">The <i>sample.cc</i> Source File</a></h2>

This source code file <code>#include</code>s the header
file we just defined.  In addition, this file is the one that actually
initializes the global data declared in the header file:

<blockquote><pre>
#include "sample.h"

const strategy	strategyList[] = {

//               - name ----    - type ----------       - chooseDist -
		{"undefined",	UNDEFINED_STRATEGY,	noStrategy	},
		{"random_wr",	RANDOM_R_STRATEGY,	selRandom_r	},
		{"random_wor",	RANDOM_NR_STRATEGY,	selRandom_nr	},

                };

const int	numStrategies = sizeof(strategyList) / sizeof(strategy);

</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote>The comment line is to help you remember the names of
the three fields of the data structures being initialized.</blockquote>

There are several things to notice about these two statements.
First, the number of elements in <code>strategyList[]</code> is
determined by the number of initializers coded.  This version of the
program initializes 
just three elements, and the compiler will give us this value in the
constant
<code>numStrategies</code> using the <i>sizeof</i> operator (which is
part of the C and C++ languages, not a function).<p>

It so happens that the three
preprocessor constants have the same numerical values as the
subscripts of their array elements, but this is not a requirement in
order for this code to work properly.  The three initialization lines
could appear in any order, and the type codes would be properly
assoicated with the corresponding names and function pointers..<p>

The point of all this is that the array
can be redefined easily when the experimenters decide they want to
add new strategies to the program.<p>

<h3>Determining Which Strategy to Use</h3>

Here is the code that reads and interpets a strategy name from a
text file:

<blockquote><pre>
int		i;
bool		found = false;
char		strategy[80];
ifstream	configFile("config.dat", ios::in);

  //  Be sure config.dat opened all right.
  if (!configFile) {

    cerr << "Unable to open \"config.dat\"" << endl;
    exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

    }

  //  Read strategy name and locate it in strategyList
  configFile >> strategy;

  for (i = 0; i < numStrategies; i++) {

    if (!strcasecmp(strategy, strategyList[i].name)) {

      found = true;
      strategyType = strategyList[i].type;
      break;

      }

    }

    if (!found) {

      cerr << "\"" << strategy << "\" is not a valid strategy name"
           << endl;
      exit(EXIT_FAILURE);

      }

</pre></blockquote>

Read the <i>man</i> page for <i>strcasecmp()</i> to see how that
function works.<p>

When the above piece of code finishes executing,
a global integer named <i>strategyType</i> will have a value of
0, 1, or 2, corresponding to the names <code>UNDEFINED_STRATEGY</code>, 
<code>RANDOM_R_STRATEGY</code>, or <code>RANDOM_NR_STRATEGY</code>.<p>

<h3>Using the Dispatch Table</h3>

Here is some code from the part of the program that actually does
the timing experiment:<p>

<blockquote><pre>
      //  Select first reference distribution
      refDist = strategyList[strategyType].chooseDist(target, true);

      //  Get a matching sample
      while (!match(refDist, target, grand(0))) {

        refDist = strategyList[strategyType].chooseDist(target, false);

	} 
</pre></blockquote>

This is the code that demonstrates calling a function using a
pointer.  Remember, <i>chooseDist</i> is the name of a member of the
<i>strategy</i> data structure that holds a pointer to a function of
type <i>chooseDist_t</i>.<p>

<blockquote> <i>Exercise:</i> Figure out how to improve the program
so that we could guarantee that <i>strategyType</i> has the proper
subscript value without counting on the programmer to set the
predefined constants <code>UNDEFINED_STRATEGY</code>,
<code>RANDOM_R_STRATEGY</code>, and <code>RANDOM_NR_STRATEGY</code>
to the values 0, 1, and 2 respectively.</blockquote>


<h2><a name="rules">The <i>rules.cc</i> Source File</a></h2>

Just for completeness, here is the function definition for one of
the functions of type <i>chooseDist_t</i>:

<blockquote><pre>
#include "sample.h"

int
selRandom_r(int target, bool first) {

  return rand() % numDists;

  }
</pre></blockquote>
