<h2>Due Date and Submission</h2>
  <p>This assignment is due immediately!  Submit it by sending email to
  me at the address, <i>vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu</i>.</p>

<h2>The Assignment</h2>

  <p>Send me an email message with "CS-343 Assignment 1" as the
  subject.  In the body of your message, put your name and the last
  four digits of your QC ID number.  <u><i>You must send this message
  from your own email account</i></u>.  I will add the address to the
  mailing list for this course.  The mailing list will be used
  throughout the semester to provide you with information about the
  course, including solutions to homework assignments.</p>

  <p>If you would like to have multiple addresses on the mailing list,
  you may do so by sending me a message from each account you want on
  the list.  Be sure each message has "CS-343 Assignment 1" as the
  subject and includes your name and ID in the message body.</p>

  <p>If your email address changes during the semester, you should
  submit this "assignment" again and I will update the mailing
  list.</p>

  <p class="block"><b>NOTE:</b> Every semester some students fail to
  get notices from me because their mailboxes fill up. (Most email
  providers put a limit on how much mail you can save on their
  servers.)  When this happens, the mail bounces back to me, but I have
  no way to notify you of the problem ... because email to you is being
  rejected!  So be sure to keep your email account in good working
  order during the term.</p>

  <p>The requirement that you use "CS-343 Assignment 1" as the subject
  of your message is because of the spam filter I use.  If you fail to
  follow this requirement I will probably never see your email.  Also,
  most homework assignments will be submitted by email, and you must
  always put the course number and assignment number in the subject of
  your messages to avoid the wrath of my spam filter.  Likewise, if you
  need to contact me about anything related to the course during the
  semester, be sure to put the course number in the subject of your
  message.</p>

  <p>Always be sure to put your name/ID somewhere in the message body of
  all email you send to me.  It's necessary in order to get credit for
  homework assignments, and I much prefer to know who I'm talking to in
  other messages.</p>

  <p>I generally respond to email very quickly.  But please give me a
  couple of days after an assignment <b>is due</b> before you nudge me
  to see if I got it.</p>

  <p>Finally, please don't send more than one copy of each email to
  me.  The address given above (vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu) is the one
  to use. If you send mail to any of my other email addresses
  (vickery@qc.edu, etc.) it just gets auto-forwarded to me at babbage
  anyway, and receiving multiple copies of the same thing is
  annoying.</p>
