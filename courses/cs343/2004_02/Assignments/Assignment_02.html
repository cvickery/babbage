<h2>Due Date and Submission</h2>

  <p>This assignment is due by <b>midnight, February 9</b>  Submit it
  by sending email to me at the address,
  <i>vickery@babbage.cs.qc.edu</i>.  Be sure to put "CS-343 Assignment
  2" in the subject of your email and to put your name/ID in the
  message body.</p>

  <p>I prefer it if you put your answers inline in the body of your
  message instead of as an attachment.  And I prefer plain text over
  HTML or word processor documents.</p>

<h2>The Assignment</h2>

  <ol>

    <li>Computer A is twice as fast as computer B.  Computer A takes ten
    seconds to run a program.  How long will computer B take to run the
    same program?

    <li>Computer A is 60% faster than computer B.  Computer A takes ten
    seconds to run a program.  How long will computer B take to run the
    same program?

    <li>Computer B is 60% slower than computer A.  Computer A takes ten
    seconds to run a program.  How long will computer B take to run the
    same program?

    <li>Computer B is twice as slow as computer A.  Computer A takes ten
    seconds to run a program.  How long will computer B take to run the
    same program?

    <li>A particular Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) has four
    classes of instruction: load/store, fixed-point, floating-point,
    and branching.  Load/store instructions all require 2 clock cycles
    to execute, fixed-point instructions all execute in one clock
    cycle, floating-point instructions all require 8 clock cycles to
    execute, and branch instructions take one clock cycle if the branch
    is successful and two clock cycles if the branch fails.  A program
    is run on a processor with this ISA and measurements show that 20%
    of the instructions executed are load/store, 50% are fixed-point,
    5% are floating-point, and the remainder are branches.  Just 15% of
    the branches fail.  What is the average number of clock cycles per
    instruction?

    <li>For the previous question, the processor operates with a 2 GHz
    clock, and the program executes 3 million instructions.  How long
    does it take the program to execute?

    <li>A 1.5 GHz clock is used to synchronize the inputs to a logic
    network that has 7 levels.  What is the maximum allowable
    propagation delay per gate?

    <li>A logic network has a 5 levels and the gates have a maximum
    propagation delay of 12 psec.  What is the maximum clock rate that
    can be used to synchronize the inputs to this network?

    <li>A computer has 1,024 registers (numbered 0 to 1,023).
    Arithmetic instructions for this computer hold three register
    numbers. How many bits are needed to hold the register numbers?

    <li>A byte-addressable memory is one that assigns a unique binary
    number as the address of each byte.  How many bits are needed for
    the addresses of a 1GB (gigabyte) byte-addressable memory?

    <li>How many bits are needed for the addresses of a 16MB
    byte-addressable memory?
