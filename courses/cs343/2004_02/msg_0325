  I have updated the code files that I am providing to you for the
  simulator project.  I am now supplying you with the implementations
  for the memory array and the memory command, and have completed the
  implementation of the load command.

  You don't have to use the new code if you have already written the
  equivalent code yourself.  But I found there were enough programming
  tricks I had to do to get the code working that it would be better
  for me to provide you with a more complete starting point than to
  have most people get bogged down with the details of managing
  conversions between longs, ints, uint32_t, and the like.  With this
  code, you should be able to load .bin files produced by the ARC
  simulator's assembler and to display the contents of simulated
  memory to verify that the file(s) have been loaded correctly.

  Let me know if you find mistakes in either the Java or the C/C++
  version!

  Your next step is to implement the simulated registers, and then to
  implement the register and pc commands.

  The new files are available from the assignment web page; just
  download the new code from the links near the end of the page.
