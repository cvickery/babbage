  The supplementary material on interrupt processing is on the web now
  at http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/IO_Processing.  There is also a
  link to it from the course syllabus web page.

  Stay tuned for your next homework assignment, which I haven't
  prepared yet.

  Don't forget, there will be no class on Monday the 17th.
