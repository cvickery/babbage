ARC Simulator v0.3
------------------------

NOTE: This version of the ARC Simulator requires the GNU C Library.
      Sorry, but certain GNU extensions make things easier, and I don't
      give a flying fsck about proprietary systems.

To install, just configure and make like everything else.
To run the simulator, once installed, type "arcsim" on the command line.
If you need help while running the simulator, typing '?', 'h', or 'help'
on the arcsim command line will bring up a list of available commands
(and aliases) along with a short description for each and the arguments
each accepts. For detailed help on a command, use the command name or
alias as an argument to the help command. The simulator isn't very
lenient with errors when running arc programs, and will exit if a
malformed instruction is encountered, so be sure to add a halt
instruction at the end of each of your programs (i.e. before it tries
to execute your data).
