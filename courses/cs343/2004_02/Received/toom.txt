Attahed is the current version of the ARC Simulator (not finished).
I use packages in my source structure.  Some classes are in ArcSim package, other are in ArcSim.Vickery package.
Not all machine language instructions can be processed.
All ALU operations can be performed.
Carry is not calculated.
 
Debugger has an extra command: debug.  It can be used to invoke ALU operations directly.
