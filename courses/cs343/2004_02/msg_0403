  I have updated the web page for the simulator assignment, including
  a link to an updated jar file that you can run to see how the
  simulator is "supposed" to work.  The web page is no longer "under
  development" but I will make updates if you find problems with it.

  The due date for the simulator is the Wednesday we get back from Spring
  break, the 14th.  The second midterm will be the following
  Wednesday, the 21st.  The midterm will cover topics related to the
  simulator as well as the microprogramming sections of chapter 6.

  So, good luck working on the project, and have a great Spring Break!
