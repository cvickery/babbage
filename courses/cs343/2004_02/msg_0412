  I hope you've been having a restful (but productive!) Spring
  Break.  I've been working on "your" simulator!!

  I mentioned in the last update to the course web page that I
  would be updating the material there based on further work to
  the C/C++ version.  I did more work on that version, but
  decided there really isn't much to do in the way of updating
  the web page.

  I also realized that it's quite a bit of work to code the
  entire simulator.  But the finished version is a very useful
  learning tool even if you didn't code it yourself.  So I've
  finished up a Java version with quite a few features that I
  think will make it useful for understanding the logic of major
  and minor cycles.  If you now go to the course web page and
  click on the "Assignment 4" link in the "Solution" column you
  can download the jar file.

  I think the program is pretty self-explanatory, as it now
  includes a "help" command.  You should now be able to load
  and simulate any ARC program generated by the textbook's
  assembler except for the "subcc" instruction which the
  textbook's assembler recognized, but this simulator does not.

  One bug I found in the textbook's assembler is that it does not
  generate all the data values for a file that looks like this:

    a:   5
         10
         15
  
  You have to reformat the .asm file so it looks like this:

    a:   5 10 15

  Otherwise, you get just one data word (the 5).

  I'll continue to test this version of the simulator, and will
  update it as I discover problems.  (Let me know about the ones
  you find!)

  You should use my simulator in two ways:  One is to verify
  that your simulator does essentially the same thing as mine,
  and the other is to test various sample programs to make sure
  you understand how all ARC instructions are executed using the
  datapath we designed.  The second exam (April 21) will rely
  heavily on your being familiar with this second item.

  See you Wednesday,
  Dr. Vickery
