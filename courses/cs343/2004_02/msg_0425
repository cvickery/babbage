  If you thought the second exam was tough, you weren't alone!
  Although there were 5 A's and the top score was 100, the class
  average was truly miserable at 66.9, and 14 out of the 25
  people who took the exam scored below 70.  Obviously, trying
  to get the class to understand the design of the CPU by means
  of the simulation assignment didn't work out.

  Rather than make it impossible for most people to complete the
  course successfully, it seemed to make sense to curve the
  scores on the exam, which I did by adding 1.5 times the square
  root of the difference between 100 and your score, capped at
  100.  That brought the class average up to about 75, but it
  still means that 10 people scored below 70.

  I'm about to post the grades on the web, but first I want to
  explain some information I'm adding to the "show my grade" web
  page.  I've added a section at the bottom that shows all the
  possible letter grades and what score you will need on the
  final exam to get each one.  Final grades are calculated by
  assigning weights of 0.33 to each of the three exams and 0.01
  to the proportion of homework assignments 1-3 you handed in.
  I've also added in separate extra credit points for people who
  submitted assignment 4.  There will be more homework
  assignments this term, so the numbers aren't totally accurate,
  but they are close enough to tell you how you're doing.  Also,
  if the lowest of your three exam scores is 10 points or more
  below your middle exam score, I (my spreadsheet, that is)
  adjusts the weights from 0.33, 0.33, 0.33 to 0.27 for the
  lowest score and , 0.36 for the other two, provided it helps
  your average.

  Of course, if the grade you want requires a final exam score
  over 100, that means you can't get that grade.
