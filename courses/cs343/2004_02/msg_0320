  I mentioned in class that I would provide initial versions of the
  simulator for you to work from in both Java and C/C++.  They are
  ready now, and can be downloaded from the assignment 4 web page.

  These are incomplete programs, but the parts that are done (the quit
  command and most of the load command) should work without problems.
  I haven't tested them thoroughly on different platforms.  Let me
  know if you find errors or have problems with them.

  The next thing to be added are the memory read() and write()
  functions that I went over in class.  For the Java version, you
  should create a new class named Memory.  For the C/C++ version, you
  should create a new source module named memory.cc.  You can either
  create a memory class or not for that version.
