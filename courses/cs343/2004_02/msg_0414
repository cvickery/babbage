Subject: Looking for student assistant

I'm looking for a student to work with me on my database web site 
project (www.infoshare.org).  It uses ASP (and, if possible, ASP.NET) 
and SQL Server, so a student who is bright and knows those (or can learn 
them quickly) would be very helpful.

They could contact me at this email address or call 718-263-0103.  
Thanks very much.
