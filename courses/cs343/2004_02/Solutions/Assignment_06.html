<div class="ans">

  <p><b>8.1 </b> The bottleneck is the ISA Bus, with its bandwidth of
  16.7 MB/sec. That's 1/16.7 seconds per megabyte, so transferring 100MB
  will take 100/16.7 seconds.  (5.988 sec.)</p>

  <p><b>8.2</b> Using the Intel architecture as our model, it's
  actually not critical for interrupts to be disabled during execution
  of an ISR, although the behavior of the CPU does guarantee that they
  are.</p><p class="block">(The CPU turns off the <i>ie</i> bit before
  it starts executing the ISR, and it doesn't get turned back on until
  the flags register is reloaded as part of executing the return from
  interrupt (<i>iret</i>) instruction.)</p><p>If the ISR were to enable
  interrupts during its execution and an interrupt were actually to
  occur, no harm would be done provided each ISR leaves unchanged the
  stack where return addresses, flag register copies, and saved
  registers are kept.  This stack mechanism allows nested ISRs to
  execute safely.  A problem could occur if the PIC matched the receipt
  of EOI an code from a nested ISR with the completion of the first
  interrupt request it had signalled instead of the most recent one. 
  But in fact, the PIC won't make a second interrupt request until any
  previous one has completed, so there's no problem with the PIC
  either.</p><p class="block">If you're thinking this too esoteric to
  put on an exam, you're probably right.</p>

  <p><b>8.5 (a)</b> The circumference of the inner track is 2&pi;r and
  r is 1.0cm, so it can hold 20,000&pi; bits. This is the number of
  bits on <i>each</i> track since the inner track is the shortest and
  the bit density is the same all over the disk.  There are 10 tracks
  per cm and 4cm (5-1) of disk surface with tracks.  With one
  additional track at the beginning (or end, depending on how you look
  at it), that's a total of 41 tracks.  Therefore, the total capacity
  of one surface of the disk is 820,000&pi; = 2,576,105 bits, the two
  surfaces together is 5,152,210 bits.</p>

  <p><b>(b)</b> 3600rpm is 60 revolutions per second, the data transfer
  rate is 2,576,105 * 60 = 154,566,300 bits per second.</p>

  <p><b>8.6</b> The longest track-to-track time would be 15*127 = 1,905
  msec (1.905 sec.).  The maximum rotational delay would be 1/60
  (0.0167) sec.  Then it would take an additional 1/32 of a rotation for
  the sector to pass under the heads, for a total of 1,905 + 16.67 +
  0.52 = 1,922.19 msec.</p>

  <p><b>8.7</b> (a)The time to read a track is equal to the time for
  one revolution: 16.67msec. (b)There are 300x2<sup>20</sup>/815 =
  385,978 bytes per cylinder.  It takes 19x16.67 = 316.67msec to read
  one cylinder from the disk to its buffer.  It then takes 385,978/300K
  = 1.256 seconds to write a cylinder to the CPU.  So, to read and
  transfer the first cylinder takes 316.67 + 1,256 = 1,572.67msec. 
  7.5m/s is 7,500mm/s, so it takes 0.25/7,500 = 0.33msec to move from
  one track to another.  Therefore the total time is 815*1572.67 +
  814*0.33 = 1,281,726.05msec (1,281 seconds), or about 21 minutes.</p>

  <p><b>Notes:</b> (1) Using powers of 2 for K and M in this question
  is okay so long as it is made clear that that is what the authors
  mean.  But disk capacities in the real world are measured using
  powers of 10 (K = 1,000 rather than 1,024).  (2) The numbers are a
  bit misleading in the sense that a 300KB/s bandwidth bus between the
  disk controller and the CPU is very slow.  The bandwidth of the PCI
  bus in Fig. 8-7 is 133MB/s, which would give 385,978/133M =
  0.002767sec for the time to write each cylinder to the CPU, reducing
  the answer to 815*2.77 + 814*0.33 = 2,526msec, or 2.5 sec instead of
  21 minutes.  (3)  The answer ignores the fact that there will be an
  average of half a sector's rotational delay from the time the heads
  arrive at a cylinder and the time at which a complete sector can
  start to be read.</p>


  <p><b>8.8</b> The sequence of events is to read a sector, wait for it
  to come around again, write it to the other surface, and immediately
  read the next sector.  It should be possible to read the first sector
  of the second track immediately after writing the last sector of the
  first track.  So the problem reduces to computing the time it takes
  for 2*10*1,000 = 20,000 revolutions.  20,000/3,000 is 6.67 minutes.</p>

  <p><b>8.10</b> The display controller has to write 60*1,024*1,024
  pixels per second, which is .000,000,015,894 seconds per pixel, which
  is about 16nsec.</p>

<h2>Additional Questions</h2>

  <p>In addition to the questions from the textbook listed above, answer
  the following questions:</p>
  
  <ol>

    <li>What is the clock speed of the USB busses in Figure 8-7? (Hint:
    USB stands for Universal Serial Bus.  That is, there is one data
    bit transferred per clock pulse.)</li>

<div class="ans">

    <p>Since 1.5B is 12b, the busses are transferring 12Mb/s.  Since
    there is one bit per transfer, the clock must run at 12MHz.</p>

</div>

    <li>The USB 2.0 specification provides three bandwidth capacities,
    called "high speed," "full speed," and "limited capacity low
    speed." Match these bandwidths to the following transfer rates:
    1.5Mb/s, 12Mb/s, and 480Mb/s.  How sincerely would you congratulate
    your friend who just bought a computer with a "full speed USB 2.0"
    port? (Hint:  The folks who developed the USB specification have
    been criticized for using the term "full speed" to mean less than
    the fastest speed.)  And how would you answer the previous question
    given the information provided in this question?  That is, what is
    the difference between 1.5MB/s and 1.5Mb/s?</li>

<div class="ans">

    <p>"Full speed" is marketing talk for 12Mb/s, not 480Mb/s.  If you
    could find a knowledgeable salesperson, you should ask the actual
    bandwidth of the bus you are buying, not its marketing name.  And
    the difference between MB/s and Mb/s is a factor of 8, the number of
    bits in a byte.</p>

</div>

    <li>A high-quality digital camera stores pictures in "raw" mode,
    meaning there is no compression of the data.  Each pixel has 256
    intensities for red, green, and blue, and a picture is taken at a
    resolution of 1600x1200 pixels.</li>
      <ol class="ABC">
        <li>How big is an image, in bits?</li> 
        <li>How big is an image, in bytes?</li>
        <li>How long will it take to transfer an image from the camera
        to a computer using each of the three USB 2.0 bandwidths?</li>
      </ol>

<div class="ans">

    <p class="block">(Since writing this question I got my new camera,
    and the instruction manual says its RAW mode is "compressed."  I
    think it's a lossless compression, meaning the original data can be
    reconstructed exactly, rather than a lossy compression like JPEG,
    which allows only an approximation of the original image to be
    reconstructed.  We'll stick with the question as asked.)</p>

    <p>You need 8 bits to encode 256 different intensities, so it's
    8+8+8 = 24 bits per pixel, and 1,600*1,200*24 = 46,080,000 bits =
    5,760,000 bytes.  At 1.5Mb/s that's 29.3 sec.  At 12Mb/s it's 3.66
    sec.  And at 480MB/s it's 0.092 sec.</p>

</div>

    <li>Here is a quotation from <a
    href="http://www.intel.com/technology/agp/3_0toverview.htm">an
    Intel web page</a>: "The AGP3.0 Specification increased the strobe
    rate from 266MT/s with AGP2.0 to 533MT/s with AGP3.0. This now
    doubles the peak AGP bandwidth to 2.1 GB/s.</li>
    <ol class="ABC">
      <li>Given what you know about bandwidth, what must "strobe rate"
      mean, and what does the "T" in "MT/s" stand for?</li>
      <li>What is the data width of the AGP bus?</li>
      <li>Figure 8-7 shows an "AGP 2X" graphics interface.  Examine the
      diagram carefully and relate it to the quote above.  Does the
      figure in the book show an AGP2.0 system?  How do you know?</li>
    </ol>

<div class="ans">

    <p>The strobe rate is the clock rate, and T/s is transfers per
    second.  The bandwidth definition says bits per second equals bits
    per transfer times transfers per second.  So 2.1GB/s = <i>x</i> *
    533M/s and <i>x</i> is 2.1G/500M.  Using decimal G and M rather than
    binary, that gives 4.2 bytes per transfer, which has to be reduced
    to the integer value, 4 (i.e., 32 bits).</p>

</div>

    <li>A computer has a PCI bus that operates at 66MHz and a width of
    32 bits.</li>
    
    <ol class="ABC">

      <li>What is the bandwidth of this bus?</li>
      <li>Two IDE disk drives are connected to this PCI bus.  They
      rotate at 10k rpm.  Each track consists of 1024 sectors, and each
      sector is 512 bytes.</li>
      <ol class="iiiiii">
        <li>How much bandwidth is required to transfer a track of data
        from one disk to memory?</li>
        <li>Can this PCI bus support both drives transferring tracks to
        memory at full speed at the same time?</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

<div class="ans">

    <p>32*66M is 2,112,000,000, or 2.1Gb/s.  A track contains 524,288
    bytes.  It takes 1/10,000 of a minute, or 6msec to read a track
    from the disk.  If it were written to memory as fast as it is read
    from the disk, it would mean writing at the rate of 512K/0.006 =
    87,381,333 bytes per sec, which is 699,050,667 = 699Gb/s.  So this
    PCI bus cannot be used to transfer even one track to memory in real
    time.  Hence the need for a buffer on the disk controller to hold a
    track while it is being transferred to memory.</p>

</div>

    <li>Using the disk drives and the PCI bus from the previous
    question, tell how much bandwidth and how many interrupts would be
    involved in transferring one sector of data to memory using a DMA
    controller, and without using a DMA controller.</li>

<div class="ans">

    <p>As explained in class, I was looking for you to give a 2:1
    bandwidth ratio here for without:with DMA, but the actual number
    varies depending on how many instructions have to be fetched during
    the DMA transfer, which depends on the cache available on the CPU
    and whether the transfer loop fits entirely in that cache or not. 
    And there will be just one interrupt for transferring an entire
    sector using DMA transfer compared to at least 128 interrupts
    without DMA, assuming the bus supports transferring 4 bytes at a
    time.</p>

</div>

    <li>Tell whether each of the following is implemented in hardware or
    in software:</li>
    
      <ul>
        <li>Device Driver</li>
        <li>Device Controller</li>
        <li>Operating System</li>
        <li>Runtime Library</li>
        <li>Interrupt Service Routine</li>
        <li>Programmable Interrupt Controller</li>
        <li>IRQ</li>
      </ul>

<div class="ans">

    <p>The device controller, the programmable interrupt controller, and
    the IRQ input to the CPU are all hardware.  The others are all
    software.</p>

</div>

    <li>The following items list a possible sequence of events.  For
    each item, tell whether it is "okay" where it is in the list or
    not. If it is okay, tell whether there are any other events that
    <i>must</i> occur before it happens.</li>

      <ul>

        <li>Kernel writes control information to the PIC, telling it
        what interrupt level to associate with each DC and how to assign
        priorities.</li>

        <li>Kernel sets up interrupt vector in memory, associating
        interrupt levels with interrupt service routines.</li>

        <li>Kernel sets the interrupt enable bit in the flags
        register.</li>
        
        <li>Device driver writes control information to the device
        controller telling it to request an interrupt when data is ready
        for reading.</li>
        
        <li>Application program calls the runtime library to read some
        data into a buffer.</li>
        
        <li>Device controller requests an interrupt because data is
        available for reading.</li>
        
        <li>PIC asserts IRQ.</li>
        
        <li>CPU is between instructions.</li>
        
        <li>The ie bit of the flags register is true.</li>
        
        <li>CPU reads interrupt level number from the PIC.</li>
        
        <li>CPU pushes flags and program counter onto stack.</li>
        
        <li>CPU loads program counter with address of ISR and starts
        executing the ISR.</li>
        
        <li>The ISR reads data from the DC.</li>
        
        <li>The ISR writes EOI to the PIC.</li>
        
        <li>The runtime library copies data from the kernel to its own
        buffer.</li>
        
        <li>The runtime library copies data from its own buffer to the
        application's buffer.</li>

      </ul>

<div class="ans">

  <p>The order given is "okay."  Programming the PIC and setting up the
  interrupt vector can be done in either order, but should be completed
  before interrupts are enabled.  The application program can ask to
  read data any time after the device driver has been installed, which
  means any time after the PIC and interrupt vector have been
  initialized.  Once the device controller has written the necessary
  control information to the device controller, data may start to
  arrive, and will be read into a kernel buffer as it arrives.  The
  runtime library is linked to an application program, so it can start
  filling its buffer any time after the program has been loaded into
  memory and has opened a connection to the device.  Meantime, interrupt
  processing can take place anytime the device controller asserts its
  interrupt request line to the PIC.</p>
