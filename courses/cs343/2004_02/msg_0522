  I've posted the answers to Assignment 6 on the web now even though
  you don't have to submit the assignment until midnight Sunday.  I
  think all the numbers are right, but I've been known to make
  careless mistakes.  So write me if any of the answers look wrong to
  you.  And use the Discussion Board if you need help understanding
  anything.

  Don't forget to check the Syllabus web page for the last reading
  assignment, which includes Chapter 8 and two additional web pages on
  interrupt processing and device controller operations.
