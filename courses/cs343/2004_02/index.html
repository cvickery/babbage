<h2>Administrivia</h2>

  <p>The class meets from 6:30 to 7:45 on Mondays and Wednesdays in SB
  Room A-145.  The course syllabus (link below) gives information about
  the textbook, exams, reading assignments, etc.  There will be two
  "midterm" exams and a final, which will be averaged with relative
  weights of 30, 35, and 35 with your lowest exam score getting the
  weight of 30.</p>
  
  <p>My office is SB Room A-222.  I will be available for office hours
  30 minutes after each class.  Most "office hour business" can be
  handled by email, however.  See Assignment 1 (link below) for how to
  contact me by email.</p>

<h2><a href="../syllabus.html">Syllabus</a></h2>

  <p>The link above takes you to the syllabus for the course, which
  gives you the textbook and reading assignments for the course, copies
  of last semester's exams, and the planned schedule of classes.</p>

<h2>Homework Assignments</h2>

  <p>Homework assignments are provided to help you practice the material
  covered in the course.  The homework assignments provide a model for
  the types of questions that will be asked on exams.</p>
  
  <p>Homework assignments are not graded, but I will record each one
  you submit, regardless of how well you answer the questions.  A small
  percentage of your course grade (1-2%) will be based on what
  proportion of the homework assignments you submit on time.  You are
  free to work with others on the assignments, and to use the
  Discussion Board at the <a
  href="http://blackboard.qc.edu/webapps/login">Queens College
  Blackboard</a> site for the course to work on the homeworks with
  others.</p>
