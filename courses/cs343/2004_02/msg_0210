  This is the first message to students on the mailing list
  for CS-345 this semester.  If you completed Assignment 1,
  you should receive a copy of this email.  If you don't get
  a copy, let me know!

  First, the solutions for Assignment 2 are now posted on
  the web.  Go to the course home page
  (http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs345/2004_02) and you
  will see a link to the solutions.  If you don't see the
  link, you may need to click the reload button on your
  browser.

  Also, the course account is now available on the college's
  Blackboard server, http://blackboard.qc.edu.  You need to
  have a separate Blackboard account to use this system.
  Your user name will be the same as your username on Forbin
  or Vanguard, but the password is independent of those
  other accounts.  If you have trouble logging in, I can
  change your Blackboard password for you.

  The purpose of the Blackboard account for this course is
  to provide you with a Discussion Board where you can
  discuss homework assignments, exams, and anything else you
  wish.  Also, it has a link to the course material on
  babbage so you can click on it instead of typing in the
  url.  I encourage you to use the Discussion Board.

  Don't forget that we don't have a class next Monday
  because of Presidents' Day.  And Wednesday the 18th will
  follow a Monday schedule, but that won't affect us because
  we meet at the same time on Mondays and Wednesdays.

  Dr. Vickery
