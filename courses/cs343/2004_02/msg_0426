  Possibly good news ...  I made a mistake when I filled out the
  answer key for the form of the exam that you took.  Bring your
  Scantron answer sheet with you on Wednesday, and I'll adjust your
  grade if you actually answered the mis-scored question correctly.
  This message is going only to those students in the course who had
  the form where I messed up the answer key, not to everyone.

  I apologize for the mistake.  "I just wanted to see if you were
  paying attention."  (And thanks to the student who spotted the
  problem.
