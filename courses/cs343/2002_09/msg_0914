If you can read this, it means you are on my mailing list for CS-343
this semeser.  Welcome!

First of all, there will be NO quiz on Tuesday; when I said there
would be one, I had your class confused with my CS-341 class.  I
apologize.

But there is a homework assignment due Wednesday.  I've updated the
course schedule to give you a link to it.

Hope your weekend is a good one,
Dr. Vickery
