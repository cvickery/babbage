I said I would send out a list of topics for next Wednesday's exam,
but as I started to do that, I realized I was just going to copy the
topics from the course schedule, which seems pretty pointless.

I suggest you use the Discussion Board to ask questions as you prepare
for the exam.  I will read it regularly and answer questions there so
everyone can share the information.

Also, I've updated the Multiplier web page a little bit.  I added a
couple of tables and some text to try to make it clearer.  It's a case
study in finite state machine (FSM) design; you won't be tested on the
multiplier specifically, but you should understand the FSM model I
went over in class, how to design a FSM (state diagrams, state
tables), and you should be able to answer basic questions about
CircuitMaker.
