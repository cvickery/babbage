I have posted the solutions to Assignment 2 on the web; there is a
link to them on the course schedule.  The "Check Grades" page does not
yet show whether you submitted that homework or not.

I have also posted Assignment 4, which will be due next Wednesday, and
updated the schedule to show that we will start reviewing the ARC
instruction set next week in preparation for designing the control
unit, which is covered in Chapter 6.  If you are not familiar with (or
have forgotten) the ARC instruction set, you should read textbook
pages 99 through 120 (the first two sections of Chapter 4) before next
Wednesday.

Have a great weekend,
Dr. Vickery
