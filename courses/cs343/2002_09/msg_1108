I've now put the questions for Assignment 5 up on the web.  This is
later than I had planned, and the assignment is a bit large (but is
excellent preparation for the exam), so I've moved the due date from
Monday to Wednesday.  And I've updated the exam date on the web too.

Have a great weekend,
Dr. Vickery
