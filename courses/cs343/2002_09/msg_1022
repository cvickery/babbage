The solution to Assignment 4 (add five numbers) is now available on
the web.  There is a link to it on the course schedule page.

Also, I have uploaded a new version of the ARC simulator zip file.
The new version is set up so you can just double-click on the jar file
to start the simulator provided you have Java 1.2 or later installed
on your computer.  In addition I cleaned up the files in the Examples
directory some, but they still don't have comments.
