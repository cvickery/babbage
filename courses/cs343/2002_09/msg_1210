As most of you know, I am teaching two sections of 343 this semester,
one at 9:00 am and the other starting at 10:30 am.  The final exam for
the 9:00 am section will be December 17 from 11 to 1 in room SB B-145.
(Note: this is NOT the same room as the class has been meeting in.)
The final exam for the 10:30 section will be December 19 from 11 to 1
in room SB C-201 (also not the room the class has been meeting in.)

I can accommodate requests to switch exam times to a limited extent.

Since C-201 is a lecture hall I can handle more students there than in
B-145.  So if you want to switch exam time, send me email as soon as
possible (no later than Wednesday), and tell me why you need/want to
switch.  People who have exam conflicts will get highest priority, but
any reason is acceptable.  It's just that I will rank the requests
based on "reasonableness."  If you have six other exams that day, your
request will get a higher priority than if you think you might want to
go to the movies instead.

Be sure to tell me which section you are registered if you write to
request a change.
