<h1>CS-343 Computer Architecture</h1>
<h2>Sections 9MD3 (2505) and 10MDA (2506)
<br>Fall 2002</h2>

<h1>Course Administration</h1>
</center>


<h2>Class Meetings</h2>

<p>Both sections meet on Mondays and Wednesdays in Science Building
Room B-141.</p>

<ul>
  <li> Section 9MD3 meets from 9:30 to 10:45 am.
  <li> Section 10MDA meets from 10:30 to 11:45 am.
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, you must attend <b>only</b> the section for which you
are actually registered.  There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The two sections will proceed at their own pace.  I plan to cover
  the same material in both sections, but the two will inevitably get
  out of synch, so attending the wrong section will cause you to miss
  material.

  <li>There is not enough room in the classroom to provide seats for
  more than the actual number of students registered.  However, there
  are still openings in the 9:00 section if you want to change your
  registration to that section from the later one.

  <li>During the first five weeks, I will be taking attendance to comply
  with university regulations.  If you attend the wrong section, you
  won't get counted present.

</ul>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Most office hour business can be handled by email.  My address is
<a href="mailto://vickery@qc.edu">vickery@qc.edu</a>.  Be sure to
include "CS-343" in the subject line of every message you send me, and
be sure to include your name in the body of each message.</p>

<p>If you want to see me in person, I will be available in my office,
Science Building room A-222, from noon to 12:30 each day the class
meets.  (There will be exceptions when this conflicts with faculty
meetings, one day a month.)  If that time is not convenient for you,
you may make an appointment to meet with me at another time.</p>

<h2>Textbooks</h2>

<p>There is one textbook for the course:</p>

<p class="block">
    Murdocca, Miles J. and Heuring, Vincent P.<br>
    <i>Principles of Computer Architecture</i><br>
    Prentice Hall, 2000<br>
    ISBN 0-201-43664-7
</p>


<p>We will be covering material from Appendix A and chapters 7, 8, and
10.  Reading assignments are on the <a href="./schedule.html">Course
Schedule</a> web page.</p>

<h2>Homework, Quizzes, and Exams</h2>

<p class="note">This is the first semester CS-343 is being offered at
Queens College, so the following information is tentative.
<br>I will inform you of changes as the semester progresses.</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>There will be several homework assignments, but they will
  count only 1% of your course grade.  That is, if there are ten
  homework assignments, each one will count 0.1% of your course
  average.</p>

    <p class="block">  You must submit your own homework solutions,
    but you are free to work on the homework assignments with anyone
    you wish. The idea is to use the homework as a way to reinforce
    the material in the course, not as a test of your knowledge.  I
    will record whether or not you hand in homeworks by the assigned
    due dates, but I will not evaluate your homework in any way.
    Instead, I will send the solutions to you by email after the
    assignment due date.</p>

  <li><p>There will be a number of short quizzes based on the homework
  assignments, which will count 5% of your course grade.  The purpose
  of these quizzes is primarily to motivate you to keep current in
  your coursework and to help prepare you for the exams.  Your quiz
  average will be the average of your best <i>three</i><sup>*</sup>
  quiz scores.  If you take fewer than three quizzes, the missing ones
  will count as zeros in your quiz average.  (<i>* The exact number
  will depend on the number of quizzes actually given during the
  semester.</i>)</p>

  <li><p>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  The two
  midterms will count 30% each, and the final will count 35%.  Each
  exam will cover approximately 1/3 of the course (see the <a
  href="./schedule.html">Course Schedule</a> web page for dates), and
  the final exam will include some reveiw material from earlier parts
  of the course.</p>

  <p>If your lowest exam score is ten points or less below your middle
  exam score, its weight will be reduced by 10% and the weights of the
  other two exams will be increased by 5% each.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Discussion Board</h2>

  <p>The Blackboard system at online.qc.edu, which you used to access
  this web page, provides a Discussion Board that I encourage you to
  use to discuss issues related to this course.  Feel free to post
  questions about the homework assignments there, for example.  But if
  you offer help on the homework, help the requestor figure out how to
  answer the problem; don't just give the answer.</p>

<h2><a href="./9MD3/check_grades.html">Check Your Grades (Section
9MD3)</a></h2>

<h2><a href="./10MDA/check_grades.html">Check Your Grades (Section
10MDA)</a></h2>

  <p>You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework,
  quizzes, and exams from one of the links above. To use this facility,
  you will need to enter a "code word."  The code word is like a
  password, but it is not as secure as a real password because you must
  tell me what it is in order to set it up.</p>

  <p class="block">Never send a real password to anyone, not even a
  professor!</p>

  <p>See the link to <i>Homework Assignment 1</i> on the course
  schedule for details.</p>

  <p>Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.</p>
