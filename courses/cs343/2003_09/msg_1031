  There was a mistake in Assignment 6, which I've fixed.  The problem
  was that I used 0x30000C as the starting address for the data,
  forgetting that this is a 22 bit number in binary, leading one
  student to submit a program that used a sethi instruction to load
  the address, followed by a srl (shift right logical) to shift the
  address to the right side of the register.  Very clever, but I
  wanted you to practice splitting the address into two parts and
  using sethi to load the leftmost 22 bits, followed by ori to fill in
  the other ten bits.   So I'm changing the requirements to use the
  address 0x40000C instead of 0x30000C, which will force you to do it
  the way I intended!  I've updated the assignment web page.

  Happy Halloween!
