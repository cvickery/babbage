<h2>DUE September 15</h2>
<hr>

<p>Send the answers to the following questions to me by email by
midnight on the Due Date.  The Subject line of your mail must say,
"CSCI-343  Assignment 2" and your mail must start with your name and ID
number.</p>

<p class="indent">Do <i>not</i> send me a Word document.  Just send me
a plain email message with your answers in it.  (If you do prepare your
answers using a word processor, copy your answers from the document
and paste them into your email message.)</p>

<p>My email address, <i>vickery@qc.edu</i> is working again now.</p>

  <li><p>Compute the GPA for a student who has the following grades:</p>
    <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Grade
      <th>Credits
    <tr>
      <td>A+
      <td>6
    <tr>
      <td>A
      <td>33
    <tr>
      <td>A-
      <td>20
    <tr>
      <td>B+
      <td>19
    <tr>
      <td>B
      <td>24
    <tr>
      <td>B-
      <td>12
    <tr>
      <td>C
      <td>6
    </table>

  <li><p>The GPA is calculated to three decimal places.  Why not two or
  four places instead?</p>

  <li><p>A program exectutes 1,500,000 instructions when it is run.  Of
  these instructions, 20% require 500 picoseconds to execute, 30%
  require 800 picoseconds to execute, and the remainder require 1.2
  nanoseconds to execute.</p>

  <p>A) What is the average execution time per instruction in
  nanoseconds?</p> <p>B) What is the average execution time per
  instruction in picoseconds?</p><p>C) What is the average execution
  time per instruction in seconds?  (Write this out as a decimal number
  with no exponent.)</p><p>D) What is the total execution time for the
  program? <br>Scale your answer so the value part is between 1 and
  999, and use the proper unit of measure in your answer.</p>

  <li><p>What is the period of a 750 MHz clock signal?<br>Scale your
  answer so the value part is between 1 and 999, and use the proper
  unit of measure for your answer.</p>

  <li><p>What is the frequency of a clock signal with a period of 250
  picoseconds?
  <br>Scale your answer so the value part is between 1 and 999, and use
  the proper unit of measure for your answer.</p>

  <li><p>To make a CD recording, the sound level is sampled at a rate
  of 44 KHz with a resolution of 1 part in 4096.  There are two audio
  channels.</p>

  <p>A) How many bits per sample must be recorded?</p>
  <p>B) How many bytes must be stored to record one minute of music?</p>

  <li><p>Each pixel on a computer monitor can display any of 256
  different intensities of red, 256 intensities of green, and and 256
  intensities of blue.  This monitor has a resolution of 1600x1200
  pixels, and a refresh rate of 80 Hz.</p>

  <p>A) How many bits have to be stored for each pixel?</p>

  <p>B) How big must the display buffer be to hold one complete image
  for the monitor screen?  Express your answer in bytes, kilobytes, and
  megabytes.</p>

  <p>C) How much time do the electron beams spend at each pixel
  position on each refresh cycle?  Give your answer in nanoseconds. 
  Ignore the time the beams spend moving from scan line to scan line
  and from the bottom of the screen to the top.</p>

  <li><p>A certain computer can have up to 2 GB (gigabytes) of memory. 
  How many bits must be used for a memory address for this amount of
  memory?  Assume this is a byte-addressable memory.</p>

  <li><p>If you have not already done so, download and install the
  CircuitMaker software on your PC.  Click on <a
  href="../../Circuit_Maker">this link</a> to get to a web page that
  gives you a link for downloading the program and instructions for
  using it.<p>
  
  <p>Assemble and simulate the circuit below using CircuitMaker.  You
  can find all the devices in this circuit (Hex Keypad, Hex Display,
  Digital Switches, and 2-input OR gates) on the Hotkeys menu.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use the Discussion Board for the course if you have
  any problems using CircuitMaker for this assignment.</p>

  <p class="indent">You will receive up to three extra credit points
  for the course if you ask and/or answer questions on the Discussion
  Board.  The more you use the board and the better the quality of your
  questions and answers, the more points you can earn.</p>

  <p class="indent">But just giving the answers to homework questions
  will <i>subtract</i> from your extra credit points!</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="./Hex_IO.png" alt="Circuit Diagram"></p>

  <p>Attach your .ckt file to your mail message when you submit this
  assignment, and answers the following questions in your message
  body:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What happens each time you click on the Keypad device (KPD1)?
    <li>What happens if you type a digit on the keyboard when KPD1 is selected?
    <li>What happens to the circuit if you click switch V1 so it is on
    instead of off and you change the value of KPD1?
    <li>Set KPD1 to '0' and change the settings of all four switches in
    various combinations.  What happens?
    <li>Set KPD1 to '8' and change the values of the switches.  What
    happens?
    <li>Write a succinct paragraph that describes this circuit and its
    behavior.
    <li>What would happen if you changed the OR gates to AND gates?
  </ul>
  
</ol>
