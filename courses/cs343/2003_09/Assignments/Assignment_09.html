<h1>CS-343 Assignment 9</h1>
</center>

<h2>Due December 18</h2>
<hr>

  <p>This is a combination assignment and final exam preparation
  guide.  As mentioned in class on 12/8, we don't have enough class
  meetings to cover all the material we "should" cover.  So we'll skip
  some topics, cover some others more lightly that I'd like, and as
  usual will cover some material differently from the way it's done in
  the book.  But most importantly, you are going to have to master some
  of the material on the final exam without the "benefit" of listening
  to me talk about it in class.<p>

  <h3>Readings</h3>
  
  <p>In addition to all of Chapter 6, you need to study the following
  parts of the textbook:<p>
  
  <ul>

    <li><p><b>Chapter 7.</b>  You need to understand the principles of
        the Memory Hierarchy (pp 243-244).  Study section 7.2; you need
        to understand the difference between static and dynamic RAM,
        how SRAM is implemented using gates and flip-flops.  Use
        Section 7.3 to extend your understanding of Section 7.2 
        Figures 7-2 and 7-4 are important.  You should already know the
        material in Section 7.5 (ROM).  Section 7.6 introduces cache
        memory.  You are responsible for all the material in this
        section through section 7.6.6, which ends on page 267.  Section
        7.6.5 is particularly important, but you need to know the
        material from earlier in section 7.6 to understand it.</p>

        <p><b>Answer Problems 7.7, 7.8, 7.9, and 7.10.</b></p>
  
    <li><p><b>Chapter 8.</b>  Read through section 8.3.3 (Direct Memory
    Access), which ends on page 313.  In addition, study the <a
    href="../../UART/">UART Web Page</a>.</p>
    
    <li><p>There are many excellent Web Sites that cover the topics
    in Chapters 7 and 8.  If you Google "northbridge southbridge" you
    can get started with some lecture notes that are available.  And
    you will soon find links to sites that either <a
    href="http://users.erols.com/chare/hardware.htm">point to other
    sites</a>, or sites with real content.  For example:</p>

    <ul>

        <li><a href="http://arstechnica.com">Ars Technica</a>  Look at
        the "black papers" section.  There are many articles dealing
        with current CPU designs, but there are also many excellent
        articles on background material to get you started.  There is a
        whole article on bandwidth, for example.

        <li><a href="http://www.tomshardware.com">Tom's Hardware</a>
        Look at "Tom's Guides" for good articles and reviews of
        PC-related technology.

        <li><a href="http://www.aceshardware.com">Ace's Hardware</a>
        More good articles and reviews.

        <li><a href="http://sharkyextreme.com">Sharky Extreme</a> 
        Still more.

    </ul>

    <p>A problem with these links is that some of their reviews of the
    "latest and greatest" technology were written a couple of years ago
    and hence are no longer current.  So as you read you need to keep
    your brain in gear and try to extract basic information and
    principles about how things work rather than pay too much attention
    about which particular device is the best of the lot.</p>

    <p><b>Exercises:</b> I'll post a copy of last semester's final exam,
    which has example questions.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3>Discussion Board</h3>
  
    <p>The  <a href="http://online.qc.edu">Blackboard</a> Discussion
    Board has a special area set up discussions related to the final
    exam.  I encourage you to use it!  (But don't forget, Blackboard
    will be down Friday the 12th and possibly Saturday the 13th, so
    plan to work around that.)</p>
