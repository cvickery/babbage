<h2>DUE September 29</h2>
<hr>

    <p>Send me a single email with the two attachments described below
    by midnight on the Due Date.  The Subject line of your mail must
    say, "CSCI-343  Assignment 4" and your mail message must start with
    your name and ID number.</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Use CircuitMaker to construct a clocked D latch using only AND,
  OR, and Inverter gates.  Use two switches for the D and clock inputs. 
  (Don't use a pulser for the clock for this exercise.)  Attach
  testpoints to the clock, D, Q, and ~Q wires in the circuit, and enable
  the waveform window by pressing F12.  Single step through the circuit,
  setting the values of D and Clock as you go along so that you
  demonstrate the effects of four clock pulses as follows:</p>

  <ol>  
    <li><p>The leading edge of the first clock pulse should turn the
    latch on if it is not already on.</p>
    <li><p>The leading edge of the second clock pulse is to turn the
    latch off.</p>
    <li><p>The latch is not to change state during the third clock
    pulse.</p>
    <li><p>Use the fourth clock pulse to demonstrate that the latch will
    change state during the clock pulse when the value of D changes.</p>
  </ol>
  
  <p>In addition, demonstrate that changing the value of D between clock
  pulses has no effect on the state of the latch.</p>

  <li><p>Go to the File->Export->Options menu item and be sure the settings
  are to export as a "Window Metafile" and that the "Color" option is
  set.  (Windows Metafile format is more compact than bitmaps.)  Set the
  LED/Lamp display option to show the state of the LEDs to match their
  state in the simulation, although that really doesn't matter for this
  assignment.</p>

  <li><p>Now use the File->Export Menu to export the circuit as
  graphic, and again to export the waveforms as graphic.  When you save
  them make the two file names include both your last name and either
  "ckt" or "waves" as part of their names.  For example, I would save
  the two files as "vickery_ckt.wmf" and "vickery_wave.wmf."  Attach
  these two <i>wmf</i> files to your email message that you send
  me.</p>

  <p class="indent">You must use these file naming conventions to
  receive credit for this assignment.</p>
