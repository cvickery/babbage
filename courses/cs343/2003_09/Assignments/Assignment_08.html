<h1>CS-343 Assignment 8</h1>
</center>

<h2>Due November 26</h2>
<hr>

  <p>Your assignment is to add two new instructions, <i>sub</i> and
  <i>subcc</i>, to the ARC Simulator developed in class.  It will be
  sufficient for you to write the code for this homework on a piece of
  paper and bring it to class on the due date, but you will receive
  extra credit if you submit a working Java modification of file
  <i>ARC_Simulator.java</i> (see below) as an email attachment
  instead.  If you prefer to reimplement the entire simulation in C++
  instead of modifying the Java version, that's okay too.</p>

<h2>Code Available</h2>

  <p>The following files are available for you to download to work with
  for this assignment:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../arc_simulator.jar">arc_simulator.jar</a>
    <li><a href="../html/ARC_Simulator.java.html">ARC_Simulator.java</a>
    <li><a href="../html/sample.asm.html">sample.asm</a>
    <li><a href="../html/sample.bin.html">sample.bin</a>
    <li><a href="../html/sample.lst.html">sample.lst</a>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Documentation for our ARC simulator is available below:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="../arc_simulator_docs/">ARC Simulator Documentation</a>
  </ul>

  <p>If you are not able to run the simulator, here is a complete copy
  of the output generated when it was run using sample.bin as the
  input file:</p>

  <ul>

    <li><a href="../html/sample.out.html">Output from <code>java 
                                   ARC_Simulator sample.bin</code></a>
  </ul>

<h2>Assignment Description</h2>

  <p>Your assignment is to modify ARC_Simulator.java so that it executes
  two new ARC machine instructions, <i>sub</i> and <i>subcc</i>.  These
  instructions are recognized by the textbook's assembler and simulator,
  but are not described in the textbook itself.  And they are not
  currently recognized by our simulator.</p>
  
  <p>The procedure to follow is as follows:  First, download the .jar
  file and be sure you can run it using the command, "java -jar
  arc_simulator.jar".  You may need to install the Java Runtime
  Environment (Java VM) from Sun Microsystems if you don't already have
  Java installed on your computer.  If you are going to try to change
  the simulator, you should install the Java Software Development Kit
  (J2SE SDK) instead of just the Java VM.  Both are available from <a
  href="http://java.sun.com">Sun's Java Website</a> -- look under
  "Popular Downloads."</p>
  
  <p>Once you are able to run the simulator, give it a program to
  simulate, for example <i>sample.bin</i> listed above.  See the
  simulator documentation for class ARC_Simulator for instructions on
  how to simulate a program.  Study the output of the simulator to make
  sure you understand it and can relate each line of output to the
  program being simulated.</p>
  
  <p class="indent">The simulator generates quite a bit of output, so
  you might want to capture it in a file, which you can examine with a
  text editor.  You can do that by putting "&gt; simulator.out" at the
  end of the <i>java</i> command line.  (Of course, you can use any
  file name you wish instead of <i>simulator.out</i>.)

  <p>Now modify <i>sample.asm</i> so that it includes both a <i>sub</i>
  and a <i>subcc</i> instruction.  Modify the <i>addcc</i> instruction
  just before the branch to do a subtraction instead of addition of a
  negative one.  You can put any <i>sub</i> instruction just before the
  <i>halt</i> instruction.  When you run the simulation now, the last
  part of the output should look like this:</p>

<pre>
             PC: 000324  IR: 80200000  Unimplemented Arithmetic op3: 004
    Register  32 changes to  00000328
    Memory at 000328 returns 91D02000
    Register  37 changes to  91D02000
             PC: 000328  IR: 91D02000  halt

Execution summary for file sample.bin:
  Instructions executed:  10
  Invalid op codes:       2
  Nops:                   0
  Clock cycles:           29
</pre>

  <p>There should be another "Unimplemented" message earlier in the
  output, for the <i>subcc</i> instruction.  Note that the value (004)
  is displayed in octal, which makes sense given that the op3 field is
  six bits wide and thus fits nicely in two octal digits.</p>

  <p>Now you're ready to start working on the assignment!  Study the
  documentation for the various classes to see what methods are
  available in each one, and then study the code given to you for
  <i>ARC_Simulator.java</i>.  From the "Unimplemented" messages printed
  by the current version of the simulator you can deduce what the op3
  values for <i>subcc</i> and <i>sub</i> are, and your job is to find
  where to put the code that will handle these two new instructions.</p>

  <p class="indent">Note 1:  In C, C++, and Java numeric constants that
  start with a zero (0) are octal numbers.  So, for example, the op3
  value for <i>orcc</i> instructions is <code>010 010</code> in binary,
  but appears as <code>022</code> in the code, which is the octal
  equivalent.</p>
  
  <p class="indent">Note 2:  Be sure you use the simulated ALU to do
  the subtraction!  You have to figure out how to do it using the ALU
  function codes available.</p>

  <p>If you are actually going to test that your code works, the
  easiest way to proceed as follows:  extract all the class file from
  the jar file, using the command, "jar -xvf arc_simulator.jar".  Now
  edit ARC_Simulator.java and compile it, which will overwrite the
  orginal copy of ARC_Simulator.class.  Test your program with the
  command "java ARC_Simulator sample.bin" and verify that the new
  subtract instructions operate correctly.</p>
