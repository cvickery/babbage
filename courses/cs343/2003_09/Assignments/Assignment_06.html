<h2>DUE November 3</h2>
<hr>

  <p>Download a copy of the ARC Simulator from <a
  href="../../../ARC_Simulator">this web page</a>.  If you are not
  already familiar with the ARC Simulator, read the information on that
  page before, during, or after you download the simulator.  Use the
  copy provided on that web page, not the one available directly from
  the textbook because I've fixed the jar file so you can click on it
  to run it.</p>

  <p>Code and simulate an ARC program that includes code that looks like
  this:</p>
  
  <pre>
              .org  0x40000C
      first:  5   ! Start an array of integers
              10
              .   ! Any number of additional lines 
              .   ! containing numbers
              .   ! go here.
      last:   -5
      sum:    0
  </pre>

  <p>Your program is to compute the sum of all the numbers between
  <i>first</i> and <i>last</i> (including both of those) and store the
  result in <i>sum</i>.</p>

  <p>Save your program in a file named "arc_add.asm" and mail the file
  to me by midnight of the due date.  Be sure to put "CSCI-343
  Assignment 6" in the subject line and to include your name and
  student ID number in the body of your message.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

  <p>This assignment's simplicity is deceptive.  First of all, note
  that the .org directive causes the first number to occupy memory
  location 0x30000C.  If you try to load the first number into a
  register using an instruction like, "ld [first], %r1" you will get an
  error message from the assembler because the address 0x40000C will
  not fit into the 13-bit immediate field of an <i>ld</i> instruction. 
  Instead, you will have to break the address into two parts, load them
  into a single register, and then use that register for loading the
  value you want. For example, you could use a <i>sethi</i> instruction
  to load the leftmost 22 bits of 0x0400000C into register 5, then use
  an <i>or</i> instruction to load the rightmost ten bits of 0x0400000C
  into register 5, and then load the contents of <i>first</i> into
  register 1 with "ld %r5, %r0, %r1."</p>
  
  <p>The other issue with this program is that a natural way to
  implement it is to use indexing to step through the elements of the
  array.  So you could load the address of <i>first</i> into some
  register, say register 5 again, and use code like this to access
  succesive elements of the array:</p>
  
  <pre>
                  add   %r0, %r0, %r6 ! clear index register
            loop: ...   ! test whether last has been reached
                  ...   ! add next number
                  add   %6, 4, %6 ! increment index register
                  ld    [%r5+%r6], %r1  ! get next element of array
                  b     loop:
  </pre>

  <p>The problem here is that the ARC simulator would execute the
  <i>ld</i> instruction just fine, but the ARC assembler doesn't
  recognize the syntax of the assembly language statement.  Until I
  finish my "new-improved" ARC assembler, you'll have to figure out a
  way around the problem, for example by adding 4 to the address in
  register 5 each time through the loop instead of using register 6 at
  all.</p>
  
  <p>Also, note that the <i>ld</i> instruction I wrote in the previous
  paragraph is not recognized by the existing ARC assembler.  You would
  have to write that code as "ld %r5, %r1" to get it to assemble.</p>

<h2>Optional (Extra Credit)</h2>

  <p>If you would like to hone your ARC assembly language programming
  skills, write your code as a subroutine that receives two addresses
  as parameters (in registers) and returns the sum in another
  register.  Code a main program that uses the subroutine to add two or
  three different sets of numbers.</p>

  <p>If you do this, be sure to mention it in your email so that I
  am sure to give you the extra credit.</p>
