  I've posted the solution for Assignment 8, including both the code
  and a description of the changes.

  Also, when you check your grades now, you will see what grade you
  need on the final exam for the different possible letter grades for
  the course.  The numbers will change a little when there are more
  homework assignments factored in, but are basically accurate.

  In working up those hypothetical grades I fixed an anomaly in my
  scoring rules for the course.  I had announced that I would reduce
  the weight of your lowest exam score if it was ten points or more
  below the second lowest score.  But with that policy there were
  cases where you would do better if one exam score was a point or two
  lower than you earned because the lower score would have triggered
  the reweighting rule.  Anyway, now there is no penalty for doing too
  well on any exam!

  Hope you had a good holiday.
