<h1>CS-343 Computer Architecture</h1>
<h2>Fall 2003</h2>

<h1>Course Administration</h1>
</center>


<h2>Class Meetings</h2>

<p>The class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 10:30 to 11:45 in SB
B-141.</p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Most office hour business can be handled by email.  My address is <a
href="mailto://vickery@qc.edu">vickery@qc.edu</a>.  Be sure to include
"CSCI 343" in the subject line of every message you send me, or your
message will be rejected by my spam filter.  Also, be sure to sign your
email with your real name, or I won't answer it.</p>

<p class="indent">I apologize for being somewhat arbitrary about these
email policies but, like everyone else, I'm getting deluged with spam
and virus messages and need to manage my messages as efficiently as
possible.</p>

<p>If you want to see me in person, I will be available in my office,
Science Building room A-222, for half an hour after each class.  If
that time is not convenient for you, you may make an appointment to
meet with me at another time.</p>

<h2>Textbooks</h2>

<p>There is one textbook for the course:</p>

<p class="block">
    Murdocca, Miles J. and Heuring, Vincent P.<br>
    <i>Principles of Computer Architecture</i><br>
    Prentice Hall, 2000<br>
    ISBN 0-201-43664-7
</p>


<p>We will be covering material from Appendix A and chapters 7, 8, and
10.  Reading assignments are on the <a href="./schedule.html">Course
Schedule</a> web page.</p>

<h2>Other Material</h2>

<p>You will be using two or three pieces of free software for this
course; you will need a PC to run them.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="../Circuit_Maker">CircuitMaker</a>  You may have used
  this software to draw and simulate logic circuits in CS-240.  If not,
  you will need to download and learn to use it from the web page
  listed here.  Runs on Windows only.

  <li><a href="../ARC_Simulator">ARC Simulator</a>  This is a Java
  program that simulates the operation of the ARC processor developed in
  Chapter 6 of the textbook.  You will need to have Java installed on
  your computer to use the simulator.  Runs on any system with Java
  installed.

  <li><b>Quartus II</b>  Altera Inc. provides a free software tool for
  designing, simulating, and programming FPGAs.  I am planning to
  assign at least one project using this software, which you can
  download for free from the Altera web site.  But the download is
  large (150 MB), and the full version is available preinstalled on the
  computers in the Hardware Lab (SB rooms 205 and 227).

</ul>

<h2>Homework, Quizzes, and Exams</h2>

<ul>

  <li><p>There will be several homework assignments, but they will
  count only 1% of your course grade.  That is, if there are ten
  homework assignments, each one will count 0.1% of your course
  average.  Submitting an assignment on time gives you full credit for
  it, no matter whether your answers are correct or not.</p>

    <p class="block">  You must submit your own homework solutions,
    but you are free to work on the homework assignments with anyone
    you wish. The idea is to use the homework as a way to reinforce
    the material in the course, not as a test of your knowledge.  I
    will record whether or not you hand in homeworks by the assigned
    due dates, but I will not evaluate your homework in any way.
    Instead, I will send the solutions to you by email after the
    assignment due date.</p>
    
    <p class="block">I encourage you to use the "Discussion Board"
    facility at <a href="http://online.qc.edu">QC Online</a> to ask
    questions about the homework assignments.  I also encourage you to
    answer other people's questions there: helping others is a great
    way to study the material.

  <li><p>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  Each exam
  will count 33.3% of your course average.  Each exam will cover
  approximately 1/3 of the course (see the <a
  href="./schedule.html">Course Schedule</a> web page for dates).  The
  final exam will <i>not</i> be cumulative unless I announce otherwise
  beforehand.</p>

  <p>If your lowest exam score is ten points or more below your middle
  exam score, its weight will be reduced by 10% and the weights of the
  other two exams will be increased by 5% each.</p>

  <p>The above percentages are subject to minor changes, which will be
  announced if they are made.  For example, the FPGA assignment will
  count more than regular homework assignments.</p>
</ul>

<h2>Discussion Board</h2>

  <p>The Blackboard system at online.qc.edu, which you used to access
  this web page, provides a Discussion Board that I encourage you to
  use to discuss issues related to this course.  Feel free to post
  questions about the homework assignments there, for example.  But if
  you offer help on the homework, help the requestor figure out how to
  answer the problem; don't just give the answer.</p>


<h2><a href="./check_grades.html">Check Your Grades</a></h2>

  <p>You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework,
  quizzes, and exams from the above link. To use this facility, you
  will need to enter a "code word."  The code word is like a password,
  but it is not as secure as a real password because you must tell me
  what it is in order to set it up.  See Assignment 1 on the <a
  href="./schedule.html">course schedule page</a> for more
  information.</p>

  <p class="block">Never send a real password to anyone, not even a
  professor!</p>

  <p>Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.</p>
