There is a copy of last semester's first exam on the course web page
now.  As I said in class today, I'm making the exam available so that
everyone in the course is on the same footing in terms of knowing what
kinds of questions I might ask.  But I do not recommend trying to use
the exam as a study guide because we covered topics differently this
semester, and your exam will reflect those differences.

Also, note that last semester's exam did allow calculators, but this
semester's exam will not.

Finally, remember to bring a pencil with you for filling out the
scantron sheets.

Good luck!
