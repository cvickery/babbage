  I updated the web pages for Assignment 8:

  1.  You can see the complete output from
  running the simulator against sample.bin,
  which is useful if you can't actually run
  the simulator.

  2.  I added a function to ARC_Simulator.java
  so that invalid op3 values will be displayed
  in octal instead of decimal.

  4.  I updated the documentation for class
  ALU so the binary values of the 16 function
  codes are listed along with brief descriptions.

  Note: The jar file is binary, so you have to
  right-click on the link in the web page in
  order to download it.

  See you Wed ...
