This is the first message being sent to the CSCI-343 mailing list
this semester.  Please let me know if you received this message
and you aren't taking CSCI-343 with me at Queens College this
semester.  Also, look at how your name is written at the
beginning of this message and let me know if it is either
somebody else's name or if you would like it written differently.

And if you are taking the course with me but didn't get this
message, let me know that too ;)

As promised, I have updated the CircuitMaker part of the second
assignment from what was posted earlier in the week.  Please go
to the assignment web page again and do the revised version.  If
you revisit the page and there is no logic circuit under Question
9, you need to get your browser to refresh the page to get the
current version.

See you Monday,
Dr. Vickery
