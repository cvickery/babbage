  <li><p>Compute the GPA for a student who has the following grades:</p>
    <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Grade
      <th>Credits
    <tr>
      <td>A+
      <td>6
    <tr>
      <td>A
      <td>33
    <tr>
      <td>A-
      <td>20
    <tr>
      <td>B+
      <td>19
    <tr>
      <td>B
      <td>24
    <tr>
      <td>B-
      <td>12
    <tr>
      <td>C
      <td>6
    </table>

<div class="ans">
  <p>1226 / (3 * 120) = 3.406</p>
</div>


  <li><p>The GPA is calculated to three decimal places.  Why not two or
  four places instead?</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>Three places are needed to discriminate between minimally different
  sets of grades, but four places adds no meaningful information
  compared to three.</p>

  <p>Consider the differences among three students:  one had A's for
  all 120 credits taken (12 * 120 = 1440 quality points), and another
  student had  A's for 119 credits and an A- for the other credit (12 *
  119 + 11 * 1 = 1439 quality points), and the third had 118 credits of
  A and 2 credits of A- (1438 quality points.  The three GPAs are
  4.00000, 3.99722, and 3.99444 respectively.  Two decimal places would
  not distinguish between the second and third students (or between the
  first and second if you rounded); three decimal places does
  distinguish among all three, and four decimal places adds no real
  information about the differences among the students' performances.</p>

</div>


  <li><p>A program exectutes 1,500,000 instructions when it is run.  Of
  these instructions, 20% require 500 picoseconds to execute, 30%
  require 800 picoseconds to execute, and the remainder require 1.2
  nanoseconds to execute.</p>

  <p>A) What is the average execution time per instruction in
  nanoseconds?</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p> Converting all times to nanoseconds, the weighted average is (0.2
  * 0.500) + (0.3 * 0.800) + (0.5 * 1.2) = 0.940 nsec. You could get
  the same answer by converting everything to picoseconds and dividing
  the result by 1,000.</p>

</div>

  <p>B) What is the average execution time per instruction in
  picoseconds?</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>940 psec</p>

</div>

  <p>C) What is the average execution time per instruction in seconds? 
  (Write this out as a decimal number with no exponent.)</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>0.000,000,000,940 sec.</p>

</div>

  <p>D) What is the total execution time for the program? <br>Scale
  your answer so the value part is between 1 and 999, and use the
  proper unit of measure in your answer.</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>1,<u>5</u>00,000 * 0.000,000,000,940 = 0.001,<u>410</u> sec.,
  which scales to 1.<u>410</u> msec.</p>

</div>

  <li><p>What is the period of a 750 MHz clock signal?<br>Scale your
  answer so the value part is between 1 and 999, and use the proper
  unit of measure for your answer.</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>1/(750E+06) = 0.001,333E-06 = 1.333E-09 = 1.333 nsec.</p>

</div>

  <li><p>What is the frequency of a clock signal with a period of 250
  picoseconds?
  <br>Scale your answer so the value part is between 1 and 999, and use
  the proper unit of measure for your answer.</p>

<div class="ans">
  <p>1/(250E-12) = 0.004E+12 = 4.0E+09 = 4.0 GHz</p>
</div>

  <li><p>To make a CD recording, the sound level is sampled at a rate
  of 44 KHz with a resolution of 1 part in 4096.  There are two audio
  channels.</p>

  <p>A) How many bits per sample must be recorded?</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>log<sub>2</sub>4096 = 12 bits per audio channel, for a total of 24
  bits per sample for the two channels combined.</p>

</div>

  <p>B) How many bytes must be stored to record one minute of music?</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>(Bits per Sample * Samples per Second * Seconds per Minute) / Bits
  per Byte = (24 * <u>44,000</u> * 60) / 8 = <u>7,920,000</u>, or
  <u>7.553</u> MB per minute.  (When converting from bytes to megabytes
  be sure to divide by 1024*1024, not by 1,000,000.)</p>

</div>

  <li><p>Each pixel on a computer monitor can display any of 256
  different intensities of red, 256 intensities of green, and and 256
  intensities of blue.  This monitor has a resolution of 1600x1200
  pixels, and a refresh rate of 80 Hz.</p>

  <p>A) How many bits have to be stored for each pixel?</p>

<div class="ans">
  <p>24: log<sub>2</sub>256 = 8 for each of the red, green, and blue
  primaries.</p>
</div>

  <p>B) How big must the display buffer be to hold one complete image
  for the monitor screen?  Express your answer in bytes, kilobytes, and
  megabytes.</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>1600 * 1200 * 3 (<i>24 bits is three bytes</i>) = 5,760,000 bytes.
  <br>5,7600,000 / 1,024 = 5,625.0 KB
  <br>5,625 / 1,024 = 5.493 MB</p>

</div>

  <p>C) How much time do the electron beams spend at each pixel
  position on each refresh cycle?  Give your answer in nanoseconds. 
  Ignore the time the beams spend moving from scan line to scan line
  and from the bottom of the screen to the top.</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>1600 * 1200 (pixels) * 80 refresh cycles per second = 153,600,000
  pixels per second.  The reciprocal is 6.510E-09, or 6.51 nsec per
  pixel.</p>

</div>

  <li><p>A certain computer can have up to 2 GB (gigabytes) of memory. 
  How many bits must be used for a memory address for this amount of
  memory?  Assume this is a byte-addressable memory.</p>

<div class="ans">

  <p>2 GB is 2<sup>1</sup> * 2<sup>30</sup> = 2<sup>31</sup> bytes.  So
  it would take 31 yes/no questions to determine which byte to read or
  write.  Since a memory address is a number that specifies which byte
  to read or write, addresses must be 31 bits.</p>

</div>

  <li><p>If you have not already done so, download and install the
  CircuitMaker software on your PC.  Click on <a
  href="../../Circuit_Maker">this link</a> to get to a web page that
  gives you a link for downloading the program and instructions for
  using it.<p>
  
  <p>Assemble and simulate the circuit below using CircuitMaker.  You
  can find all the devices in this circuit (Hex Keypad, Hex Display,
  Digital Switches, and 2-input OR gates) on the Hotkeys menu.</p>

  <p class="indent">Use the Discussion Board for the course if you have
  any problems using CircuitMaker for this assignment.</p>

  <p class="indent">You will receive up to three extra credit points
  for the course if you ask and/or answer questions on the Discussion
  Board.  The more you use the board and the better the quality of your
  questions and answers, the more points you can earn.</p>

  <p class="indent">But just giving the answers to homework questions
  will <i>subtract</i> from your extra credit points!</p>

  <p align="center"><img src="./Hex_IO.png" alt="Circuit Diagram"></p>

  <p>Attach your .ckt file to your mail message when you submit this
  assignment, and answers the following questions in your message
  body:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What happens each time you click on the Keypad device (KPD1)?

<div class="ans">

  <p>The number displayed increases by one.  When it gets to 0xF
  (Hexadecimal F), it then wraps around to zero.  The Hex display always
  shows the same value as the keypad.</p>

</div>

    <li>What happens if you type a digit on the keyboard when KPD1 is selected?

<div class="ans">

  <p>The It takes on whatever value you type.  The Hex display changes
  too.</p>

</div>

    <li>What happens to the circuit if you click switch V1 so it is on
    instead of off and you change the value of KPD1?

<div class="ans">

  <p>Switch V1 is connected through an OR gate to the "1" input of the
  Hex display, so the Hex display always shows odd-numbered values.</p>

</div>

    <li>Set KPD1 to '0' and change the settings of all four switches in
    various combinations.  What happens?

<div class="ans">

    <p>The switches can be used in various combinations to cause any
    value to show in the hex display.</p>

</div>

    <li>Set KPD1 to '8' and change the values of the switches.  What
    happens?

<div class="ans">

    <p>The display always shows a value between 0x8 and 0xF.</p>

</div>

    <li>Write a succinct paragraph that describes this circuit and its
    behavior.

<div class="ans">

  <p>Either the hex keypad or the switches can be used to set the values
  of the four inputs to the hex display.  The hex display shows the
  hexadecimal representation of the four-bit binary number connectied to
  its inputs.</p>

</div>

    <li>What would happen if you changed the OR gates to AND gates?

<div class="ans">

    <p>In order for an input to the hex display to be a one, both the
    corresponding switch and the the corresponding output from the hex
    keypad would have to be 1.</p>

</div>

  </ul>
  
</ol>
