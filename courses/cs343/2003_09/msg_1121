
  I have updated the course web page to include a homework
  assignment that is due on Wednesday.  You don't have to write
  the whole ARC simulator (I did that for you!), just part of
  it.

  I was wondering how doing homework assignments correlates with
  exam performance, and came up with the following numbers, which
  show the average grade on the second exam as a function of how
  many of the previous three homeworks were submitted:

    Number of     Exam 2    Number of
    Homeworks     Average   Students
    Submitted
    ---------     -------   ---------
      0/3          53.7        3
      1/3          73.9       11
      2/3          68.8        5
      3/3          84.4        8

  Now, the relationship is not perfect, but it does show a good
  correlation between doing the homeworks and doing well on the
  exam.  And correlation doesn't show causality: it could be that
  the good students would do well on the exams even if they
  didn't do the homeworks and/or that the poor students wouldn't
  do well on the exams even if they did do the homeworks.  And the
  numbers of students in the different categories are too small
  to make inferences of statistical significance.

  But having made all those disclaimers, I conclude that you
  should all do all the homework assignments!
