  For what it's worth, grading the final exam was no more
  fun than taking it was! A couple of people did fine (top
  raw score was 98%), but the class as a whole had a lot of
  trouble with it, so I applied a curve that brought the
  class up to a a mean of 74 and a median of 79, about in
  line with the scores on the other two exams. (When the
  median is higher than the mean, it means that there were a
  few particularly low scores that brought down the mean.)

  Here's how I computed everyone's course average: There
  were 8 required assignments and one optional one ("4a"),
  each of which was worth 2 points. So a perfect assignment
  score was 16, but it was possible to get more than 16
  points if you did the optional assignment and/or received
  a "good" rather than an "ok" on any assignments. ("good"
  was worth 3 and "not ok" was worth 1.) That left 84 points
  for the exams; 28% each. But if your lowest exam score was
  10 points or more below the average of the other two, its
  percentage dropped to 18% and the other two counted 33%
  each.

  The final break-down for the class was 3 A's, 3 B's, 5
  C's, 2 D's, and 2 F's.

  Best wishes for a great summer!
