  For those of you looking for an assignment to work on
  during your Spring Break, I have posted the web page for
  Assignment 7. It's not due until the Thursday after we get
  back, but is unusual in that you have to do the assignment
  on paper and bring it with you to class on the due date.
  No midnight emails for this one.

  Hope you're having a great break!

  Dr. Vickery
