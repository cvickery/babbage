  As promised, there is a copy of last semester's first exam available
  on the course web site now.  The link to it is in the "Links to
  Other Pages" box at babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs343/2005_02.

  I urge you NOT to use last semester's exam as a study guide for this
  semester's exam on Monday.  This semester's exam will be different.
  Nonetheless, I know people like to have access to this sort of
  thing, and am providing it so everyone will be on equal footing in
  that regard.

  Also, I will NOT be providing answers to the questions on last
  semester's exams.  If I can get to it (and I'm not sure if I can),
  I'll set up a message board where you can discuss it with your
  classmates.  If that does happen, I'll send out another message to
  the mailing list.

  Good luck on the Monday!
  Dr. Vickery
