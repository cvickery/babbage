  As I mentioned earlier, there is a program you can use to minimize
  boolean expressions that are too complex to process using Karnaugh
  Maps.  I've updated the minimization web page at:

    http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/Minimize

  It now gives you access to both the old and new versions of the
  program, and includes updated instructions on how to use both.
  There were working drafts of both the updated web page and the
  new version of the program on the web site for a while, so you
  should revisit the web page and re-download the program now to be
  sure you have the current versions.

  The web page and the program are not required parts of the course,
  but the program can make the homework assignment that's due tomorrow
  easier to do.  Please let me know if you spot errors in either the
  web page or the program.
