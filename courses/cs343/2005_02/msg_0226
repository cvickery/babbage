  This is to let you know that the CS-343 Assignment 4 web page is
  available for your viewing pleasure now.  I decided to have you use
  CircuitMaker to implement 4 bits of the MIPS ALU designed in
  Appendix B and covered in class last week.  The assignment web page
  gives you some important information you will need to be able to do
  the design successfully.

  If you haven't gotten around to mastering CircuitMaker yet, I urge
  you to do so now.  I think it will really help you to understand
  what is going on in the course.  I will go over the design a little
  bit in class on Monday for those who still find CircuitMaker
  difficult, and have made the due date for the assignment Wednesday
  instead of Monday to give everyone time to do it successfully.
  Also, if you haven't submitted Assignment 3 yet, this gives you time
  to finish it up before the cutoff due date for that assignment,
  which will be Monday.

  Note that unlike Assignment 3, this is a purely combinational
  circuit: no clock, no flip-flops.

  The first exam is scheduled for Monday March 7.  There will be
  several of questions in which I will provide you with the 4-bit
  input values for A, B, and F and ask you to give the Result, Carry,
  Overflow, and Zero output values.  Your working version of
  Assignment 4 is will provide you with the perfect study aid for this
  part of the exam!

  As always, please let me know if you find errors or anything unclear
  in the assignment web page or any other course material.
