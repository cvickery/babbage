  First, let me point out that despite the
  "personalized" form of this message, the same message
  is going out to everyone on my CS-343 mailing list
  this semester.  Please let me know if that's not
  your name, as you like to see it written, at the
  beginning of this message.  And if you get this
  message but aren't a student in my CS-343 course at
  Queens College this semester, please let me know
  about that!

  Second, this is to let you know that I've reworked
  the home page for the course at:

    http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs343/2005_02

  I've written the page so it adheres to current web
  standards, and I've checked it against Firefox and
  Internet Explorer versions 5.5 and 6.  If anything
  about it is "broken" when you access it (or if you
  find any other problems on my web site), please let
  me know.  Be sure to tell me what browser/operating
  system caused the problem.

  The Textbook section of the course page has a link to
  my current errata list for the book, which in turn
  includes a link to the publisher's errata list, which
  was recently updated.

  Finally, the Assignment 3 web page is ready now; you
  can get to it from the "Assignments" link on the
  course web page.

  Remember, there will be no class on Monday because of
  President's Day.  Have a great weekend, and I look
  forward to seeing you next Wednesday!

  Dr. Vickery
