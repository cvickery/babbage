  This is to let you know I've posted the solutions for Assignment 5
  on the course web site.  This is considered "sensitive" material
  because the authors don't want this sort of thing out on the web
  where any student anywhere can use them in courses where assignments
  are graded more carefully than in cs343.  So (1) there is no link to
  them (see below) and (2) don't copy them for others.

  You can see them at:
  babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs343/2005_02/Assignments/Solutions_05.php.

  I hope they help you prepare for the next exam!
