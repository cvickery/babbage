  The final grades for CS-343 are posted on the web now.  There were
  some temporary values there for the last day or so that calculated
  the homework scores incorrectly, but they have been corrected now.

  Your final course average was calculated by weighting each of the
  three exams equally and by having the homeworks count 10% of the
  course grade, as announced at the beginning of the term.
  Specifically, your homework score was calculated by giving you a 1
  for each "not ok," 2 for "ok," and 3 for "good."  There were 11
  required assignments (0 through 11 but not 9), so a perfect homework
  score was 11*2 = 22.  So 10% of your course grade was calculated as
  10*x/22, where x is the "Num Hw" value you see when you check your
  grades on the web.  If you had any "good" scores and/or did the
  optional parts for either Assignment 3 or 4, it was possible to
  have a homework score that was actually greater than 10.  The quiz
  counted 2% of your grade, so your average on the three exams counted
  88% to give 100% total.

  As mentioned in the Assignment 9 web page, once your course average
  was computed using the above algorithm, the translation to a letter
  grade for the course was a mechanical process dictated by the
  college's grading policy.

  Best wishes for a great summer,
