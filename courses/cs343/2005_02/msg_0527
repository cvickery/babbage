  Final exam scores are posted now.

  There was a curve, which was slightly different for the two
  sections.  If you got 100 on the exam, it means yours was the top
  score in your section.  After the curve, the class average was about
  77 in one section and 78 in the other.

  I'll update the web site with course grades after I have received
  and graded the extra-credit papers.  Don't forget, the due date for
  them is the 29th, with no extensions.
