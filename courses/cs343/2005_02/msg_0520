  The Assignments web page for the course now has links to web pages
  with solutions for assignments 10 and 11, a review guide for Chapter
  7, and a copy of last semester's final exam.

  That review guide includes answers to the questions in Assignment 11
  that were taken from the textbook.  Those answers can't be posted on
  public web sites because some professors assign them for grades.  So
  when you click on that link you'll be asked for a user name and
  password.  Use these:
  
    User name: cs345
    Password:  sunfish

  Good luck on your finals!
