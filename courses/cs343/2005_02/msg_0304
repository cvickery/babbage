  Now there is a forum you can use to discus issues relating to
  CS-343, such as Monday's exam, homework assignments, etc.  There is
  a link to it from the course home page, where it says "Discussion
  Forum."  Or you can go directly to babbage.cs.qc.edu/Forums/cs343.

  Anybody can read what's posted there, but you have to register on
  the forum to be able to post messages.

  Let me know if you have any problems with it or questions about
  using it.
