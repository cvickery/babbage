  This is to let you know I've posted solutions for Assignment 8 on
  the course web site.  As with Assignment 5, his is considered
  "sensitive" material because the authors don't want this sort of
  thing out on the web where any student anywhere can use them in
  courses where assignments are graded more carefully than in cs343.
  So (1) there is no link to them (see below) and (2) don't copy them
  for others.

  You can see them at:
  babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs343/2005_02/Assignments/Solutions_08.php.

  Because of the exam on Thursday, I have made these answers available
  now rather than after "handing back" your submissions for
  correction.  You can still get partial credit for this assignment by
  submitting your answers by Monday; just don't try sending me a copy
  of the solutions that I've just posted!
