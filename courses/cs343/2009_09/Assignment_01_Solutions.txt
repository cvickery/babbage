   1.  How many orders of magnitude larger than 520 is 40,000?

        The nearest power of ten to 520 is 1,000, and the nearest power of ten
        to 40,000 is 10,000, so 40,000 is just one order of magnitude larger
        than 520.

   2.  How many orders of magnitude larger than 520 is 90,000?

        The nearest power of ten to 90,000 is 100,000, so 90,000 is two orders
        of magnitude larger than 520.

   3.  How many orders of magnitude larger than a picosecond is a millisecond?

        A picosecond is 10^-12; a millisecond is 10^-3, so a millisecond is
        12-3=9 orders of magnitude larger than a picosecond.

   4.  Convert 250 nanoseconds to picoseconds.

        250,000 picoseconds

   5.  Convert 250 nanoseconds to microseconds.

        0.250 microseconds

   6.  Convert 250 milliseconds to nanoseconds.

        250,000,000 nanoseconds

   7.  What is the “normal” representation of 5,280µsec?

        5.280 msec.

   8.  On the average, how many yes/no questions would you have to ask someone
       if they were thinking of a number between 1 and 10?

          log2(10) = ln(10) / ln(2) = 3.322

   9.  How many bits would you need to encode the digits 0 … 9?

        ceil(log2(10)) = 4

  10.  Write out two different binary codes to represent the digits 0 … 9.

         BCD    Gray
      0  0000   0000
      1  0001   0001
      2  0010   0011
      3  0011   0010
      4  0100   0110
      5  0101   0111
      6  0110   0101
      7  0111   0100
      8  1000   1100
      9  1001   1101
      *  1010   1111
      *  1011   1110
      *  1100   1010
      *  1101   1011
      *  1110   1001
      *  1111   1000

      * = unused code values
      Gray code: only 1 bit differs between adjacent values.

  11.  Calculate the weighted average of the following values; show all work:

                  	Value	Frequency
                    70	  200
                    80	  100
                    90	  700

        Divide each frequency by 1000, and their sum is 1.0, so 70×.2 + 80×.1 + 90×.7 = 85

  12.  At Queens College, grade point averages use the number of credits for each
       letter grade as the weights and the following table to relate letter grades to
       values:

                  	Grade	Value
      							A+	  4.0
      							A	    4.0
      							A-	  3.7
      							B+	  3.3
      							B	    3.0
      							B-	  2.7
      							C+	  2.3
      							C	    2.0
      							C-	  1.7
      							D+	  1.3
      							D	    1.0
      							F	    0.0

        What is the GPA of a student who has received A- in 3 courses, B+ in 2
        courses, and B in 5 courses, if each course was 3 credits? Show all work.

          9×3.7 + 6×3.3 + 15×3.0 = 98.1
          98.1 /(9+6+15) = 3.270

  13.  What would be the GPA of the student in the previous question if he had
       failed a 1-credit course in addition to receiving the grades listed in the
       question?

          98.1/(9+6+15+1) = 3.164

  14.  Show the terms needed to calculate how many bits would be needed to record 10
       sec of CD-quality music (stereo). That is, do not do the calculation, but show
       what numbers would be multiplied together to get the answer.

          44,000 samples per second × 10 seconds × 2 channels × 12 bits per channel

  15.  How many bits in 64 KB? Show all work.

          64 = 2^6
           K = 2^10
           B = 2^3
        64KB = 2^19 bits
             = 524,288 bits

  16.  A disk spins at 10,000 RPM. How long does it take to make one revolution? Answer
       in seconds, using the correct unit of measure to give a “normal” value with the
       integer part between 1 and 999.

       10,000 RPM / 60 = 166.667 RPS (revolutions per second) = 0.006 seconds per
       revolution = 6 msec.

  17.  How long would it take to transfer a 250 MB program from disk to main
       memory if the initial latency is 5 msec and the bandwidth of the channel
       between the disk and main memory is 600 Mbps? Show all work.

       250 MB = 2000 Mb

       2000Mb/600Mbs = 3.333 sec transfer time
                     + 0.005 sec latency
                     -------
                       3.338 sec

  18.  How long would it take to execute one million instructions if the average
       number of clock cycles per instruction is 2.2 and the clock speed is 3 GHz?
       Show all work.

          sec/program = instructions/program × clocks/instruction × seconds/clock
                      = 10^6 × 2.2 × 1/3 × 10^-9
                      = 0.0007333 sec
                      = 733.3 microseconds

  19.  “Computer A is twice as fast as computer B.” What does that mean in terms
       of how long it takes the two computers to execute a program?

          Computer A requires half as much time to execute the program compared to Computer b.

  20.  “Computer A is 100% slower than Computer B.” Turn that into a meaningful
       statement, if you can. If you cannot, explain why not.

          My best guess would be to interpret "is 100% slower" to mean "requires
          100% more time." 100% more time would mean twice as much time, so
          Computer A is apparently half as fast as Computer B.
          
          But that's just a guess. When comparing ratios, it makes more sense to talk about
          the ratio of the slower time divided by the longer time, and it is ambiguous what
          the times involved in a "times slower" sentence mean.
