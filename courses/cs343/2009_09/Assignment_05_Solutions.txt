CS-343 - Fall 2009  Assignment 5 - Vickery Solutions

Jump Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

  1.    How long does it take to fetch the instruction?
     10 PC Read
    100 Instruction Read; Calculate PC+4
    ---
    110 psec
 
  2.    How long does it take the Control Unit to decode the instruction?
     50 Control Unit
    ---
    160 psec

  3.    Which takes longer: calculating PC+4 or fetching the instruction?
        PC+4 and fetching the instruction are exactly coterminous.

  4.    When is the Jump Address valid?
    110 psec after the clock pulse (see item #1)

  5.    When would it be safe for the next clock pulse to occur?

     10 psec after Control unit generates the Jump signal: the time for the
        mux input to the PC to change state.

    110
     50
   + 10
    ---
    170 psec after the clock edge.


Branch Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

  1-2   Same as Jump Analysis
    110 psec

  3.    When is the BTA valid?
    100 psec after instruction and PC+4 are available
    ---
    210 psec

  4.    When is the A operand valid?
    100 psec after the the instruction is available (register read)

  5.    When is the B operand valid?
    110 psec after the instruction is available (register read + mux);
        control unit is overlapped with this.

  6.    When is the ALU function code valid?
    100 psec after the instruction is available (control unit + ALU control)

  7.    When is the Z output of the ALU valid?
    200 psec after #2 + max(#4, #5, #6)
    ---
    420 psec

  8.    When would it be safe for the next clock pulse to occur
     10 psec after the Z output is valid (plus the AND gate)
    ---
    430 psec

R-Type Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------
  1-2   Same as above
    110 psec

  3-6   When is the ALU Result valid?
    420 psec (Same as Branch Analysis for Z, above.)

  7.    When is the WR Reg input to the register file valid?
     10 psec after the instruction was available. (not critical)
    ---
    120 psec

  8.    When is the Write Data input to the register file valid
     10 psec after the ALU Result became valid: MemToReg mux delay,
        in parallel with the PC input mux delay.
    ---
    430 psec

  9.    When would it be safe for the next clock pulse to occur?
    100 psec after the WR Reg and WR Data inputs to the register
        file are valid.
    ---
    530 psec


Store Word Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

  1-2   Same as above
    110 psec

  3-6   In this case, the inputs to the ALU are valid 10 psec earlier
        than for R-type and Branch instructions: i.e, 210 psec after
        the clock edge. Because ALUSrc is 1 (after 160 psec), the B
        input to the ALU comes from the SignExtImm value that was
        available as soon as the instruction fetch completed (110 psec),
        and arrival of the Read Data 2 value from the register file
        at the 210 psec point will have no effect on the output of the
        ALUSrc mux. So all the inputs to the ALU (A, B, and func) are
        valid after 210 psec, and the result is valid at the 410 psec
        point.
    410 psec

  7.    When is MemWrite control signal valid?
    160 psec (not critical)

  8.    When would it be safe for the next clock pulse to occur?
    100 psec after the data memory address is valid.
    ---
    510 psec


Load Word Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------

  1-7   Same as for Store Word
    410 psec

  8.    When is the WR Reg input to the register file valid?
    120 psec (Same as R-Type #7; not critical.)

  9.    When is the Write Data input to the register file valid?
    110 psec after the memory address is valid (mem read + MemToReg mux)

  10.   When would it be safe for the next clock pulse to occur?
    100 psec after the memory data is available at the register file
    ---
    620 psec

  The longest clock period is 620 psec = 620 * 10^-12 sec
  The maximum frequency is 0.0016129 * 10^12 Hz = 1.6129 * 10^9 Hz = 1.6129 GHz
