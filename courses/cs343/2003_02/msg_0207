There is a web page with the solutions for Assignment 2, and there is
a link to it on the course schedule page.  Please let me know if you
spot any typos in the solutions.

Assignment 3, which will be due February 19, is not ready yet.  (The
college will be closed on 2/12 for Lincoln's Birthday and on 2/17 for
President's Day.)  See you Monday.
