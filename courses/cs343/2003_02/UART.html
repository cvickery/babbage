<h1>UART Design and Programming</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>UART stands for "Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter."  For
  our purposes, it is a relatively simple device that illustrates the
  the nature of device controllers (DCs) in general.</p>
  
  <p>A UART acts as the interface between an I/O bus and a serial
  device, such as a mouse or modem, which communicate with
  a computer one bit at a time.  On a PC, there are two UARTs that
  connect to the COM1 and COM2 ports on the back of the computer.</p>
  
  <p>The job of a UART is to accept bytes of data from the CPU 8 bits
  at a time (in parallel) and to transmit them one bit at a time
  (serially) to whatever device is plugged into its connector on the
  back of the computer.  At the same time, it receives data bits
  serially from the device, which it assembles into bytes that the CPU
  reads in parallel.</p>
  
  <p style="text-align: center"><img src="./UART_1.png" alt="UART and
  CPU"></p>
  
  <p>Internally, a UART has several different registers that the CPU can
  read and write.  The following table lists just a few of them.  The
  left column lists the addresses the CPU uses to access these registers
  for a UART being used for COM1 in a standard PC.</p>
  
  <table border=1 cellpadding=5 align=center width=90%>
  <tr>
    <th>Address
    <th>Name
    <th>Function
    
  <tr>
    <td>0x3F8
    <td>RBR
    <td>Read Buffer Register.  The CPU reads data bytes from this
    register.
    
  <tr>
    <td>0x3F8
    <td>THR
    <td>Transmitter Holding Register.  The CPU writes data bytes to this
    register.

  <tr>
    <td>0x3F9
    <td>IER
    <td>Interrupt Enable Register.  The CPU writes a byte to this
    register to tell the UART when to generate interrupts.  Individual
    bits within the byte indicate whether to generate an interrupt when
    the RBR is full, when the THR is empty, or when an error condition
    is detected.

  <tr>
    <td>0x3FA
    <td>IIR
    <td>Interrupt Identification Register.  The CPU reads this register
    to find out why the UART generated an interrupt.

  <tr>
    <td>0x3FB
    <td>LCR
    <td>Line Configuration Register.  The CPU writes bytes to this
    register to configure parameters like baud rate (the speed at which
    bits are sent and received) and parity (error checking) options.

  <tr>
    <td>0x3FD
    <td>LSR
    <td>Line Status Register.  The CPU reads from this register to
    find out whether the RBR is full, whether the THR is empty, or
    whether an error condition has been detected.

  </table>

  <p>This table is far from complete, but it is accurate as far as it
  goes.  The registers described here give us enough to work with so we
  can see how a Device Controller works.</p>
  
  <p>To understand how a UART operates we also need to introduce two
  additional registers that are not in the table, and which the CPU
  cannot access directly.  These are the shift registers connected to
  the R<sub>x</sub> and T<sub>x</sub> wires.  The R<sub>x</sub> shift
  register (R<sub>x</sub> SR) is an 8 bit register that receives
  incoming serial data.  When 8 data bits have arrived, the
  R<sub>x</sub> SR is transferred in parallel into the 8-bit RBR. 
  While waiting for the CPU to read from the RBR, the R<sub>x</sub> SR
  can start receiving bits from the next input byte on the
  R<sub>x</sub> line.  Likewise, the there is a T<sub>x</sub> shift
  register (T<sub>x</sub> SR) that gets loaded from the THR in
  parallel, and then shifts the bits out over the T<sub>x</sub> wire
  one at a time.  While the T<sub>x</sub> SR is transmitting a byte,
  the CPU can write another data byte to the THR.</p>

  Registers"></p>

<h2>Software Layers</h2>

  <p>The descriptions of the registers in the table above used phrases
  like, "the CPU reads ..." and "the CPU writes ".  Statements like
  this means that some software, called a <i>Device Driver</i> executes
  the CPU's <i>in</i> and <i>out</i> ISA-level instructions.  For
  example, the Intel Architecture instruction <i>inb 0x3F8</i> would
  read a byte from the RBR of the COM1 UART into the CPU's "AL"
  register.</p>
  
  <p>Each Device Controller attached to the I/O Bus has its own Device
  Driver in the operating system.  As the figure below indicates, the
  Device Driver is the lowest of several layers of software involved in
  I/O operations.  At the top of the figure, a program (this could be a
  C or C++ program) has set up an array of bytes named <i>inBuf</i> and
  calls a function to read a string of characters into the array.  We'll
  assume that the string the program reads consists of characters a user
  types on a keyboard that is connected to the R<sub>x</sub> input line
  of a UART.</p>
  
  <p>The <i>fgets()</i> function is part of the C or C++ Runtime
  Library that gets linked to all C/C++ programs.  The library
  functions manage their own buffer of data.  If there are enough data
  bytes available in the library buffer, the call to <i>fgets()</i> is
  just a quick function call that copies the requested string from the
  library buffer to <i>inBuf</i>, and the user's program spends
  virtually no time at all making the function call.  But if there are
  not enough bytes in the library buffer to satisfy the call to
  <i>fgets()</i>, it calls <i>read()</i>, which is an Operating System
  Call that goes through several layers of software in the OS until
  finally some code extracts bytes from the Device Driver's "typeahead
  buffer" shown in the lower part of the figure.  When the device
  driver reads a byte from the RBR, it puts it into the tail of the
  typeahead buffer FIFO (first-in, first-out queue).  This buffer is
  called a "typeahead" buffer because the user can type characters
  before any program tries to read them, and they will be kept here
  until a <i>read()</i> system call consumes them and passes them back
  up to the library's buffer.  But if the typeahead buffer doesn't have
  a complete string in it when the <i>read()</i> function is executed,
  the program will be blocked until the user types enough characters
  for the Device Driver to put into the typeahead buffer for the
  <i>read()</i> function to complete.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center"><img src="./UART_3.png" alt="Software
  Layers"></p>

  <p>The boundary between the Runtime Library and the Operating System
  is an important one.  The input and output instructions that Device
  Drivers execute are "privileged" instructions that will cause the CPU
  to generate a fault (a hardware-generated exception) if code in the
  library tries to execute them.  Switching the CPU from non-privileged to
  privileged mode is a very time-consuming operation compared to a
  simple function call, a topic (hopefully) covered in your Operating
  Systems course.  The Runtime Library is designed to minimize the
  number of system calls a program has to make as much as possible.</p>

<h1>Device Driver Designs</h1>

  <p>The material in the following sections supplements the equivalent
  material in section 8.3 of the textbook on pages 308 through 313.  The
  idea is that these topics might be easier to understand if they are
  related to the concepts of Device Controllers, which are missing from
  the textbook.</p>

<h2>Polled ("Programmed") I/O</h2>

  <p>Before reading from the RBR, the device driver must read from the
  LSR to determine if there is a new byte available there yet or not.  A
  simple way to program a device driver it to code an endless loop that
  looks something like this:</p>
  <pre>
        char  lsr;
        char  rbr;
        char  typeahead[100];
        int   nextPut = 0;
        for ( ;; )
        {
          lsr = inbyte( 0x3FD );
          if ( (lsr & 0x01) != 0 )
          {
            rbr = inbyte( 0x3F8 );
            typehead[ nextPut++ ] = rbr;
          }
        }
  </pre>

  <p>There are several things to say about the above code.  The first
  is that it is written in C/C++, where the size of a <i>char</i> is
  one byte.  (In Java, a char is two bytes.)  The second is that it
  assumes there is a function or macro named <i>inbyte()</i> that takes
  an I/O address as an argument, and returns a byte that it reads from
  that address.  The third is that the sample code assumes that the bit
  in the rightmost position of the LSR (0x01) gets turned on by the
  UART's control logic every time the R<sub>x</sub> SR fills up and is
  transferred to the RBR, and that this bit gets turned off when the
  CPU reads from the RBR.  Fourth, the typeahead array needs to be
  implemented as a "bounded buffer," which means that all the code for
  making <i>nextPut</i> wrap around to the beginning and all the logic
  for producer-consumer synchronization would need to be added in a
  real Device Driver.  Again, that's a topic for your Operating Systems
  course to cover.</p>

  <p>The endless loop in this code is called a "polling loop."  The
  device driver asks the device controller ("polls the device
  controller") by reading the LSR to find out if there is a new data
  byte to read, and reads the byte if there is.  Whether there is
  anything to read or not, the code then just goes back and polls the
  LSR again immediately.  This coding technique dedicates all the CPU's
  fetch-execute cycles to polling and reading the Device Controller,
  which leaves no time for the CPU to execute anything else. 
  (Including the consumer side of the producer-consumer relationship!) 
  A modified version of this polling technique might actually be
  appropriate in a situation where a simple CPU is dedicated to
  processing data from a high-speed source such as a laboratory
  instrument.  But in general, it is too restrictive for general
  purpose computing.</p>

<h2>Interrupt-Driven I/O</h2>

  <p>Instead of constantly polling the Device Controller, the Device
  Driver can configure the Device Controller to send a special signal
  to the CPU whenever the LSR changes in an "interesting." way. 
  (Interesting means, for example, when a new byte is loaded into the
  RBR from the R<sub>x</sub> SR but not when the CPU reads from the
  RBR, even though both events cause the LSR to change.)  This signal
  is called an <b>I</b>nterrupt <b>R</b>e<b>Q</b>uest (IRQ).  An Intel
  processor has just one IRQ wire going into it, which can be thought
  of as a separate wire among the control wires of the I/O bus.  (A
  separate device called a Programmable Interrupt Controller handles
  the management of different IRQs coming from the various Device
  Controllers in the system.)</p>

  <p>Instead of dedicating all the CPU's execution cycles to polling
  Device Controllers, the operating system can scheule other programs to
  run while a program is waiting for I/O.  The CPU fetch-execute cycle
  we looked at in Chapter 6 is modified so that the CPU checks the
  status of the IRQ line just before each instruction fetch.  If it is
  true, the CPU writes the contents of all the registers, including the
  <i>psr</i> (which contains the condition code bits) into a reserved
  area of memory, and fetches the next instruction from the code in the
  device driver that reads the LSR, which by definition will indicate
  either that the RBR is ready for reading, the THR is ready for
  writing, or that an error has occurred that requires some sort of
  recovery action.  This part of the Device Driver that gets called by
  the CPU itself in response to an IRQ is called an <i>interrupt
  handler</i> or an <i>interrupt service routine (ISR).</i>  When the
  ISR finishes polling and reading or writing the Device Controller
  registers, it executes a "return from interrupt" instruction, which
  signals the CPU that it can resume the interrupted program by
  loading all the registers from the reserved area of memory and
  fetching the instruction addressed by the <i>pc</i> register.</p>

  <p>Managing interrupts from multiple Device Controllers and scheduling
  multiple programs to use the CPU in the intervals between interrupts
  are, yet again, topics for your Operating Systems course.</p>
 
<h2>Direct Memory Access</h2>

  <p>If you look at the polling loop code above and think about what is
  happening, you can see that each byte of data gets read into the CPU
  and then written out from the CPU to memory, requiring two bus cycles
  each.  (Because the program uses the <i>lbr</i> variable in memory
  there are actually two overhead bus cycle that could be eliminated by
  writing:
  <p class="indent">
      typeahead[ nextPut ] = inByte( 0x3F8 );
  </p>
  <p>A good compiler would optimize the first version of the code to
  eliminate the extra cycles.)</p>
  
  <p>For a low-speed controller like a UART, the overhead of moving data
  from the Device Controller to the CPU and from the CPU to memory is
  not worth worrying about.  But devices like disk drives can place an
  unnecessarily heavy load on the system if every byte being read from
  the drive has to cause an I/O interrupt and two bus cycles to get into
  a memory buffer.  The solution is to design the disk drive's device
  controller so it can be operated in Direct Memory Access (DMA)
  mode.</p>

  <p>A DMA-capable device controller has registers to which the CPU can
  write the address of the beginning of a buffer in memory and it's
  size.  After writing the address and size values into these
  registers, the CPU writes a value to another register in the controller
  that tells it to start a DMA transfer.  The controller then writes
  the data directly into the memory buffer as it arrives from the disk
  drive, and only sends one IRQ to the CPU when the entire transfer has
  completed.  The efficiency gained is the elimination of half the bus
  cycles due to transferring the bytes to the CPU, and the elimination
  of almost all the interrupt processing.  The bus, however must be
  designed to arbitrate between the CPU and the device controller,
  since both will be trying to use the bus at the same time. The CPU
  can be fetching instructions from one part of memory while the disk
  controller is trying to write data to another part of memory using
  the same bus, but only one bus transfer can actually occur at a
  time.</p>
  
  <p>As with all the rest of the material in this web page, extending
  this description of DMA transfers to writing as well as to reading
  functions is left as an exercise for the student.(!)</p>
