The grades for Exam 1 are posted on the Check Grades web page.

The exam averages for the three sections of CS-343 that I am teaching
ranged from 76 to 79, with no significant differences among the three
sections.  The lowest score was 31, and the highest was 100.  The
distribution of letter grades (grouping A+, A, and A- together, etc.)
across all three sections was:

 Grade Range   Number
  A (90-100)    23
  B (80-90)     26
  C (70-80)     17
  D (60-70)     15
  F (00-60)     11

You need a grade of C or better in this course to use it as part of
the CS major and/or to use it as a prerequisite for other courses in
the department.  That means a course average of 73 or better.  (An
average between 70 and 72 is a C-, not a C.)  This exam will count
about one third of your course average.

Also, the web page for Homework Assignment 5 is on the course schedule
web page now.
