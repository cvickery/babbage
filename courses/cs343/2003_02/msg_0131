  Welcome to CS-343 for the Spring 2003 semester.  By receiving this
  email, you know that I entered your address into my mailing list for
  the course all right.  But check that this message has your name at
  the beginning and let me know if it doesn't; it's possible that I
  could have put your email address next to someone else's name in my
  mailing list by mistake.

  Also, you should go to the course web page and check your grades.
  The code word you sent me should work, and you should see that I
  recorded Homework Assignment #1 as "ok."  Let me know if there's
  anything wrong with this.

  Finally, Friday evening I updated the web page for your Homework
  Assignment #2, which is due Wednesday.  I fixed one typo, and added
  another question.

  I hope you enjoy the semester,
  Dr. Vickery
