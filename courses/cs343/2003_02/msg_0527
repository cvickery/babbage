  There is a mistake on the "Course Administration" web page
  for CS-343 about how the course average is calculated.  Each
  exam counted 33% of your course average, not 33.3% as the web
  page said.  So the three exams together counted 99% of your
  grade, and the proportion of the homeworks that you submitted
  (between 0.00 and 1.00) counted the other 1%.

  There was also a discrepancy between what you saw on the web
  for the second exam compared to what was actually recorded.
  Because of the curve for that exam, your score was actually a
  floating-point number, not the integer value that was
  displayed.  That means that if the fractional part of that
  score was over 0.5, you saw a score that was slightly higher
  than the score that was used to compute your average, and if
  the fractional part was less than 0.5, you saw a score that was
  slightly lower than what was actually used to compute your
  average.  It didn't seem right to mislead the people with the
  higher fractional scores, so I manually adjusted their scores
  in the spreadsheet to match the integer value shown.  However,
  I left the fractional part for scores where it helped.  The
  result is that a couple of people now have the next higher
  grade for the course than they did when I sent out the
  announcement of unofficial grades the other day.

  That's all for CS-343 this semester!

  The new Hardware Lab course has been scheduled for 6-8 pm on
  Mondays and Wednesdays in the fall.  I'll send out a course
  description to everyone now taking 343 after I finish my other
  grading for this term.

  Have a great summer!!
