<h1>CS-343 Computer Architecture</h1>
<h2>Spring 2003</h2>

<h1>Course Administration</h1>
</center>


<h2>Class Meetings</h2>

<p>All my sections meet on Mondays and Wednesdays.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Section 10MDA meets from 10:30 to 11:45 am in SB B-141.
  <li>Section 1MA3 meets from 1:30 to 2:45 in am SB B-141.
  <li>Section E6MBA meets from 6:30 to 7:45 pm in SB D-133.
</ul>

<p>You must attend <b>only</b> the section for which you are actually
registered.  There are several reasons for this:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The sections will proceed at their own pace.  I plan to cover
  the same material in all my sections, but different sections will
  inevitably get out of sync, so attending the wrong section will
  cause you to miss material.

  <li>There is not enough room in the classroom to provide seats for
  more than the actual number of students registered.

  <li>During the first five weeks, I will be taking attendance to comply
  with university regulations.  If you attend the wrong section, you
  won't get counted present.

</ul>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Most office hour business can be handled by email.  My address is
<a href="mailto://vickery@qc.edu">vickery@qc.edu</a>.  Be sure to
include "CS-343" in the subject line of every message you send me, and
be sure to include your name in the body of each message.</p>

<p>If you want to see me in person, I will be available in my office,
Science Building room A-222, for half an hour after each class.  If
those times are not convenient for you, you may make an appointment to
meet with me at another time.</p>

<h2>Textbooks</h2>

<p>There is one textbook for the course:</p>

<p class="block">
    Murdocca, Miles J. and Heuring, Vincent P.<br>
    <i>Principles of Computer Architecture</i><br>
    Prentice Hall, 2000<br>
    ISBN 0-201-43664-7
</p>


<p>We will be covering material from Appendix A and chapters 7, 8, and
10.  Reading assignments are on the <a href="./index.html">Course
Schedule</a> web page.</p>

<h2>Other Material</h2>

<p>You will be using two or three pieces of free software for this
course; you will need a PC to run them.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="../Circuit_Maker">CircuitMaker</a>  You may have used
  this software to draw and simulate logic circuits in CS-240.  If not,
  you will need to download and learn to use it from the web page
  listed here.  Runs on Windows only.

  <li><a href="../ARC_Simulator">ARC Simulator</a>  This is a Java
  program that simulates the operation of the ARC processor developed in
  Chapter 6 of the textbook.  You will need to have Java installed on
  your computer to use the simulator.  Runs on any system with Java
  installed.

  <li><b>WEB Pack</b>  Xilinx Inc. provides a free set of software tools
  for designing, simulating, and programming FPGAs.  But the software is
  quite large (~60 MB) and complex to learn, so I'm not sure we will be
  able to include it in the course this semester.  I can burn the
  software onto a CD if you want to use it and don't have the bandwidth
  to download it directly from Xilinx.
</ul>

<h2>Homework, Quizzes, and Exams</h2>

<ul>

  <li><p>There will be several homework assignments, but they will
  count only 1% of your course grade.  That is, if there are ten
  homework assignments, each one will count 0.1% of your course
  average.  Submitting an assignment on time gives you full credit for
  it, no matter whether your answers are correct or not.</p>

    <p class="block">  You must submit your own homework solutions,
    but you are free to work on the homework assignments with anyone
    you wish. The idea is to use the homework as a way to reinforce
    the material in the course, not as a test of your knowledge.  I
    will record whether or not you hand in homeworks by the assigned
    due dates, but I will not evaluate your homework in any way.
    Instead, I will send the solutions to you by email after the
    assignment due date.</p>
    
    <p class="block">I encourage you to use the "Discussion Board"
    facility at <a href="http://online.qc.edu">QC Online</a> to ask
    questions about the homework assignments.  I also encourage you to
    answer other people's questions there: helping others is a great
    way to study the material.

  <li><p>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  Each exam
  will count 33.3% of your course average.  Each exam will cover
  approximately 1/3 of the course (see the <a
  href="./schedule.html">Course Schedule</a> web page for dates).  The
  final exam will <i>not</i> be cumulative unless I announce otherwise
  beforehand.</p>

  <p>If your lowest exam score is ten points or more below your middle
  exam score, its weight will be reduced by 10% and the weights of the
  other two exams will be increased by 5% each.</p>

</ul>

<h2>Discussion Board</h2>

  <p>The Blackboard system at online.qc.edu, which you used to access
  this web page, provides a Discussion Board that I encourage you to
  use to discuss issues related to this course.  Feel free to post
  questions about the homework assignments there, for example.  But if
  you offer help on the homework, help the requestor figure out how to
  answer the problem; don't just give the answer.</p>

  <li>Section 10MDA meets from 10:30 to 11:45 am in SB B-141.
  <li>Section 1MA3 meets from 1:30 to 2:45 in am SB B-141.
  <li>Section E6MBA meets from 6:30 to 7:45 pm in SB D-133.

<h2><a href="./10MDA/check_grades.html">Check Your Grades: Morning
Section (10MDA)</a></h2>

<h2><a href="./1MA3/check_grades.html">Check Your Grades: Afternoon
Section (1MA3)</a></h2>

<h2><a href="./E6MBA/check_grades.html">Check Your Grades Evening
Section {E6MBA)</a></h2>

  <p>You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework,
  quizzes, and exams from one of the links above. To use this facility,
  you will need to enter a "code word."  The code word is like a
  password, but it is not as secure as a real password because you must
  tell me what it is in order to set it up.</p>

  <p class="block">Never send a real password to anyone, not even a
  professor!</p>

  <p>See <a href="./Assignments/Assignment_01.html">Homework
  Assignment 1</a> for details.</p>  (There are links to all homework
  assignments on the <a href="./index.html">Course Schedule</a> web
  page.)

  <p>Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.</p>
