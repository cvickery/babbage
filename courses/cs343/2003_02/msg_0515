  I've finished the web page on the UART device controller that I
  mentioned in yesterday's class.  There is a link to it from the
  course schedule page.

  The material on this web page supplements the assigned reading in
  Chapter 8, and is "fair game" for questions on the final exam.

  The final exam will be all multiple choice questions, I think.  I
  haven't finished writing it, and it's possible you might have to
  draw a diagram or two, but I don't think so.  And ther definitely
  won't be any essay questions.

  Good luck on all your exams!
