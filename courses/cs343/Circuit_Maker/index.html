<h1>Getting Started With Circuit Maker</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div class="whitebox">

  <p>In this course, we will be using the free student edition of a
  commercial program, CircuitMaker, to design and simulate logic circuits. 
  You can also get a copy of the student version of CircuitMaker from the
  course web site using this link: <a
  href="./circuitmaker_student.exe">Download CircuitMaker from this course's
  web site</a>.  Note that this software is avaialbe only for student use on
  their own computers; it is not available for use on college computers. 
  The file you download (3,400,151 bytes) is a self-installing package for
  Windows; just click on it to start the installation process.  Let me know
  if you do not have access to a computer on which you can install this
  software.</p>

</div>

<a name="help"></a>
<h2>Using the Program</h2>

  <p>The program is very well designed, but it is not something that you
  can just pick up and start using without some instruction.  That's
  because it assumes you already know how to design digital logic, and
  does not provide real tutorial material.</p>

  <p>What follows are some pointers to help you get started and to help
  you avoid some common problems.  There is also help that comes with
  the program, but it tends to be sketchy.</p>

<div class="whitebox">

  <ol>

    <li><p>The first thing to realize is that CircuitMaster can be used
    to design and simulate both analog and digital signals.  (Wherever
    you see "Spice" in the help system, it's talking about analog
    simulation.)  You can build your circuit without concern for this
    fact, but when you simulate it (run it), you must be sure to do so
    in digital mode.  If you don't, you'll get a cryptic message,
    probably telling you that you need a ground node "before a valid
    spice netlist can be generated".  To avoid this problem click on the
    toolbar button with the symbol for a transistor on it; it's exactly
    in the middle, 12 buttons in from both ends of the toolbar.</p>

    <p>Just get in the habit of clicking on the transistor button (it
    turns into an AND gate) everytime you start running CircuitMaker. 
    Better yet, set up CircuitMaker with your favorite options,
    including setting the simulation mode to digital, while working on
    the default circuit, "UNTITLED.CKT."  Then save UNTITLED.CKT (just
    type Control-S), and those options will automatically be in effect
    the next time you run CircuitMaker.</p>

    <p class="indent">If you get any error messages when
    you try to simulate your circuit, read the above paragraphs!</p>

    <li><p>If you care about the neatness of your diagrams, select
    <i>Grid</i> under the Options menu, and select the "Snap to grid"
    option.  I personally find it distracting to display the grid
    itself, but that's a choice you can make from the same menu.</p>

    </li><p>Use the Wire Tool (the toolbar button that looks like a plus
    sign) to connect inputs and outputs together.When you want to add a
    wire, click on one connection point, and move the mouse with the
    mouse button released.  That way the wire will go in a straight line
    in the direction you move the mouse.  Click again and you can move
    90 degrees from the direction you were moving in before.  You should
    have "Options -> Quick Connect" selected so the connection points
    are highlighted as you get near them.  Alternatively, you can hold
    down the mouse button and drag the end of the wire to the connection
    point, and CircuitMaker will automatically square up the lines
    between the two points; but the lines will not be very well
    organized if you do this, possibly going through the middle of some
    gates and/or lying on top of other lines.</p>

    <li><p>Use the <i>Devices</i> menu to select gates, etc. to add to
    your circuit.  Many simple gates and devices are listed on the
    Hotkey submenu without the need to browse through device and parts
    lists.</p>

    <li><p>A common input device is the digital logic switch, which
    alternates between outputting 0 or 1 each time you click on it.  You
    can type a lower-case 's' "Hotkey" to get one, or look for it in
    Hotkeys2 under the Devices menu, or select browse from the Devices
    menu, and select Digital -&gt; Power.</p>

    <li><p>The Hex Keypad (Hotkey: 'H') device is very useful when you
    need to set several inputs at once.  It has four outputs that you
    can control by typing a hex digit while the keypad is selected.  Or
    click on it to make it step up by one.</p>

    <li><p>The complement of the Hex Keypad is the Hex Display (Hotkey:
    'h'), which shows the states of up to four wires as a hexadecimal
    digit.</p>
    
    <li><p>The simplest clock source is the Pulser device.  Ignore the
    inputs, and just use either output (one is the complement of the
    other) as your clock signal.  See <a href="#sequencer">the data
    sequencer item below</a> for a more powerful (but more complex)
    alternative.</p>

    <li><p>A few shortcut keys can speed your work up considerably:
      <ul>
        <li>Alt-W turns the cursor into the crosshair so you can place
        wires.
        <li>Alt-A turns the cursor into an arrow so you can point at
        wires or gates to move them around, etc.
        <li>Alt-D turns the cursor into a lightning bolt so you can
        delete items from your diagram.
      </ul>

    <li><p>You can simulate your circuit one step (propagation delay) at
    a time, or let it run at "full speed."   Either way, you can use the
    probe tool (the 8th button from the right end of the toolbar, next
    to the button that has an inverter on it) to look at the logic value
    of any part of your circuit.  The probe will show H ("high"), L
    ("low"), or Z (indeterminate) as you make it hover over various
    parts of the circuit.</p>

    <p>Better yet, turn on the trace option (under Simulation menu, or
    press F11).  With this option on, the wires are colored to show
    their logic state and you don't need a probe.</p>
    
    <li><p>If the simulation runs too fast for you to see what's
    happening, you can slow it down using Simulation -> Digital Options
    menu to select a speed between values of 1 to 30.  This is just an
    ordinal scale; the units don't have real meaning.</p></li>

    <li><p>You will probably want to look at the waveforms for various
    parts of the circuit as you run your simulations.  Use F12 to turn
    this option on, or press the toolbar button to the right of the one
    with the inverter on it.  The waveforms are displayed in a separate
    window, so select "tile" from the Window menu to get them both to
    show on the screen.</p></li>

    <li><p>You won't be able to look at waveforms unless you select some
    signals to look at first.  (The F12 key won't do anything and the
    toolbar button will be greyed out.)  The most common way to add
    signals to the waveforms window is to attach the Scope tool to the
    wires you want to look at.  Type captial T to get a Scope tool, or
    select it from the Hotkeys2 menu under the Devices menu.  To give
    meaningful names to your waveforms, double-click on the scope tool
    and type in the name you want to use.  (The default name, "TPn"
    stands for "Test Point number <i>n</i>.)</p></li>

    <li><p>You can move waveforms up and down by dragging their names in
    the waveforms window.  The white boxes to the left of the names are
    used for setting breakpoints.  You can learn how to use breakpoints
    from the on-line help.</p></li>

    <li><p><a name="sequencer">Another way</a> to get a clock signal to
    generate it using a <b>Data Sequencer</b>.  Type captial G to get
    one, or browse to it under Digital/Instruments under the Devices
    menu.  Here's how to set it up so that pin 1 on the right side can
    be used as a clock signal:</p>

      <ol class="la">

        <li><p>Double click on the device, and you will get an "Edit
        Data Sequencer" dialog box.  First of all, resist the temptation
        to turn on the "Use External Clock" option; it generates values
        at the proper rate for simulation (one propagation delay per
        step) all by itself.  Edit the first 8 rows of the "Address -
        Data" box so that addresses 1, 2, 3, 4 contain 00, and addresses
        5, 6, 7, 8 contain 01. Set the Start and Stop Addresses to 1 and
        8 respectively.</p></li>

        <li><p>When the simulation runs, the sequencer will output 0 on
        output No. 1 for four propagation delays, then will output 1 on
        the same output pin for another four propagation delays.  The
        process repeats as long as the simulation runs.  Connect a scope
        tool to the output to add this waveform to your waveform
        window.</p></li>

        <li><p>This device can be used to generate any sequence of
        arbitrary 8-bit values, which makes it useful for testing
        certain complex circuits.</p></li>

    </ol></li>
