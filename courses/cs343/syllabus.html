<h1>CS-343 Computer Architecture</h1>
<h2>Syllabus</h2>

<hr>

  <p>All reading assignments, except links to web pages, are in the
  text for the course, <u>Computer Organization and Design, <i>Third
  Edition</i></u> by D. Patterson and J. Hennessy (Morgan Kaufmann,
  2004).</p>

  <p>The first printing of the book has quite a few typographical and
  other errors (<i>errata</i>).  Many of these will be corrected in
  successive printings.  The <a
  href="http://www.mkp.com/companions/1558606041">companion web site for
  the book</a> has an "official" errata list. I have also compiled my
  own list <a href="./errata.html">here</a>.
