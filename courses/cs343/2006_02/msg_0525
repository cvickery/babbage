
  The grades for CS-343 are posted now.  Once again, the class did not
  do well on the exam.  I've been wrestling with the curve for a
  couple of days now, and this is what I finally did:  There were 37
  questions, and everyone missed at least 8.  So I put in an
  8-question curve.  That is, I multiplied the number of questions
  right by 100/29 instead of 100/37.  How many curve points you got
  depends on how many questions you got right; the average number of
  points was 17.5 points, giving an average grade on the exam of 80.8
  instead of 63.3.

  Then I checked the homework grades: there were 8 assignments, and I
  assigned a value of 2 for each "ok" and 1 for each "late" or "not ok".
  Although the maximum score possible was 16, the highest anyone got
  was 15.  Ultimately, I divided your homework score by 13 and
  multiplied by 10 for 10% of your course grade.  Thus, if you got more
  than a 13 for your homeworks, you actually got more than 10 points.

  Bottom line: There were 3 A's, 3 B's, 7 C's, and 2 D's in the
  course. (A = 90-100, B = 80-89, C = 70-79, D = 60-69).

  I'm genuinely disappointed in the grades, and welcome any
  suggestions you wish to send me to try to make the course turn out
  better in the future.  But looking at the amount of material
  mastered (based on exam performance) I couldn't justify inflating
  the grades any more than I did.
