
  The grades for Assignment 4b and the First Exam are posted, but not
  the grades for Assignment 4a (yet).

  The exam grades were disappointing.  They ranged from a low of 32 to
  a high of 96.  I gave a ten point curve (with a score limit of 100),
  and the curved score is what is posted.  After the curve, the mean
  and median score were both 77; there were 5 grades in the A (90 to
  100) range, 3 in the B range, 3 in the C range, 4 in the D range,
  and 2 F's.
