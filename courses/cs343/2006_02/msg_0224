  Greetings!  Despite your name appearing above, this is a mass
  mailing to everyone in CS-343.  If that's not your name above, let
  me know so I can fix up my mailing list!

  Some of you have noticed that Assignment 3 is posted on the course
  web page now.  I'll be going over the basics of sequential circuits
  in class but probably won't have time to go over the assignment
  carefully.  So I want to point out:
  
  (1) If you haven't completed Assignment 2 yet, you really need to do
  so despite the lateness.  Assignment 3 is another circuit design
  project that you won't be able to complete if you haven't done the
  ALU Slice project first.

  (2) If you haven't been studying Appendix B of the textbook, you're
  going to have a terrible time trying to do these assignments.  I
  think most people are on top of things okay. But if you are behind,
  this is probably the last chance you will have to get caught up in
  the course.

  See you in class ... and on the Discussion Forum!

  Dr. Vickery
