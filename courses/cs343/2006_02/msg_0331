

  There is a web page describing the SPIM Assignment at
  http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs343/SPIM_Assignment.  The due
  date will be Friday April 7.

  I fixed up my driver code so it should be a bit more robust than the
  version I demonstrated in class today.

  Use the course Forum if you have questions or problems.  I'll be
  checking there regularly.
