
  There is a copy of the first exam (of three) from the Spring 2005
  term available on the web site.  You need a user name and password
  to access it:

    User name:  cs343
    Password:   architecture

  Remember, this exam is intended only to provide you with an idea of
  the kinds of questions I ask, not to serve as a study guide.  For
  one thing, we covered different material this year compared to a
  year ago.

  The direct URL to the exam is:

  The first exam for this semester will be this Friday, the 17th.
