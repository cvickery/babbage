  If your check the course web site now you will find some material to
  help you prepare for the exam on Thursday.  I've finished working on
  the web page covering the state machine design we did in class last
  week.  I've proofread it, but suspect there are still typos in it,
  so if anything looks wrong or is unclear, please let me know.  (Be
  sure to put CS-343 in the subject line of your message or I probably
  won't see it.)

  There is also a link to last semester's first exam.  Do _not_ use
  that as a "study guide," just as an indication of the types of
  questions I have asked in the past.  Please note: I will NOT be
  providing answers to last year's exam questions.  When I've done
  that in the past, some people have spent their time learning those
  answers and then done terribly on the exam as a result.

  See you Tuesday,
  Dr. Vickery
