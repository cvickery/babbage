<h2>5.1</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

      <p>Combinational logic only: a, b, c, h, i</p>
      <p>Sequential logic only: f, g, j</p>
      <p>Mixed sequential and combinational: d, e, k</p>

</div>

<h2>5.2</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

      <p>a. RegWrite = 0: All R-format instructions, in addition to lw ,
      will not work because these instructions will not be able to write
      their results to the register file.</p>

      <p>b. ALUop1 = 0: All R-format instructions except subtract will
      not work correctly because the ALU will perform subtract instead
      of the required ALU operation.</p>

      <p>c. ALUop0 = 0: beq instruction will not work because the ALU
      will perform addition instead of subtraction (see Figure 5.12), so
      the branch outcome may be wrong.</p>

      <p>d. Branch (or PCSrc) = 0: beq will not execute correctly. The
      branch instruction will always be not taken even when it should be
      taken.</p>

      <p>e. MemRead = 0: lw will not execute correctly because it will
      not be able to read data from memory.</p>

      <p>f. MemWrite = 0: sw will not work correctly because it will not
      be able to write to the data memory.</p>

</div>

<h2>5.3</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

      <p>a. RegWrite = 1: sw and beq should not write results to the
      register file.  sw ( beq) will overwrite a random register with
      either the store address (branch target) or random data from the
      memory data read port.</p>

      <p>b. ALUop0 = 1: lw and sw will not work correctly because they
      will perform subtraction instead of the addition necessary for
      address calculation.</p>

      <p>c. ALUop1 = 1: lw and sw will not work correctly.  lw and sw
      will perform a random operation depending on the least significant
      bits of the address field instead of addition operation necessary
      for address calculation.</p>

      <p>d. Branch = 1: Instructions other than branches (beq) will not
      work correctly if the ALU Zero signal is raised. An R-format
      instruction that produces zero output will branch to a random
      address determined by its least significant 16 bits.</p>

      <p>e. MemRead = 1: All instructions will work correctly. (Data
      memory is always read, but memory data is never written to the
      register file except in the case of lw .)</p>

      <p>f. MemWrite = 1: Only sw will work correctly. The rest of
      instructions will store their results in the data memory, while
      they should not.</p>

</div>


<h2>5.13</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

      <p>From Figure 5.18, the MemtoReg control signal looks identical
      to both signals, except for the don't care entries which have
      different settings for the other signals. A don't care can be
      replaced by any signal; hence both signals can substitute for the
      MemtoReg signal.</p>

      <p>Signals ALUSrc and MemRead differ in that sw sets ALSrc (for
      address calculation) and resets MemRead (writes memory: can't have
      a read and a write in the same cycle), so they can't replace each
      other. If a read and a write operation can take place in the same
      cycle, then ALUSrc can replace MemRead, and hence we can eliminate
      the two signals MemtoReg and MemRead from the control system.</p>

      <p>Insight: MemtoReg directs the memory output into the register
      file; this happens only in loads. Because sw and beq don't produce
      output, they don't write to the register file (Regwrite = 0), and
      the setting of MemtoReg is hence a don't care. The important
      setting for a signal that replaces the MemtoReg signal is that it
      is set for lw (Mem->Reg), and reset for R-format (ALU->Reg), which
      is the case for the ALUSrc (different sources for ALU identify lw
      from R-format) and MemRead ( lw reads memory but not
      R-format).</p>
