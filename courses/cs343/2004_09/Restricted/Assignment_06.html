<h1>CS-343 Assignment 6 Solutions</h1>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
<div class="whitebox">

  <ul>
    <li><b>depth:</b> The number of stages in a pipeline.</li>
    <li><b>latency:</b> The time it takes for an instruction to emerge
    from a pipeline after entering it.</li>
    <li><b>throughput:</b>  The rate at which instructions are
    completed.</li>
    <li><b>bubble:</b>  A pipeline stage that is doing no useful work.</li>
    <li><b>stall:</b> The situation when one or more pipeline stages
    repeat the same operation while waiting for a control or data hazard
    to clear.</li>
    <li><b>structural hazard:</b> A limitation on parallelism due to
    lack of hardware resources, such as arithmetic units or
    interconnection pathways.</li>
    <li><b>data hazard:</b>  A dependency between the generation of a
    result and its use that must be accounted for in the design of a
    pipeline.</li>
    <li><b>control hazard:</b>  The possible execution of incorrect
    instructions due to branch and jump instructions in a pipelined
    datapath.</li>
    <li><b>reordering:</b>  Changing the sequence in which instructions
    are executed compared to the sequence in a program.  May be done by
    either a compiler or in hardware to reduce or eliminate data and
    control hazards.</li>
    <li><b>result forwarding:</b>  A technique for reducing or
    eliminating data hazards in a pipelined design in which a result
    is passed directly back to an earlier stage without waiting for the
    instruction to pass completely through the pipeline.</li>
    <li><b>delayed branch:</b>  A technique for reducing or eliminating
    control hazards in a pipelined design in which the instruction
    following a branch instruction is always executed regardles of
    whether the branch is taken or not.  Instruction reordering (see
    above) is used to fill this "delay slot" with productive work
    whenever possible, but if this fails a <i>nop</i> (no-operation)
    instruction has to be used to fill the slot.</li>
    <li><b>prediction:</b>  A technique for deciding which fork
    following a branch instruction to feed into the pipeline in an
    attempt to reduce pipeline stalls.</li>
    <li><b>speculative execution:</b>  A technique in which both forks
    following a branch are executed in parallel, and the unused fork is
    discarded once the result of the branch condition has been
    determined.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
  <ul>
    <li>5 GHz</li>
    <li>It would be five times (400%) faster.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
  <ul>

    <li><b>IF/ID</b>: 62 or 64 bits: Instruction (32) and PC+4 (32 or
        30)</li>

    <li><b>ID/EX</b>: 114 bits: WB (2), M (2), EX (4), Read data 1&amp;2
    (64), Address/Immediate (32), and <i>rt</i>&amp;<i>rd</i> (10)</li>

    <li><b>EX/MEM</b>: 72 or 74 bits: WB (2), M (2), Branch target (30
    or 32), Zero bit from ALU (1), ALU result (32), and writeback
    register number (5)</li>

    <li><b>MEM/WB</b>: 71 bits: WB (2), Mem data (32), ALU result (32),
    and writeback register number (5).</li>

  </ul>
</div>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<div class="whitebox">
  <p>These two figures, and Figure 6.33 as well, do not show the
  connection from the register file to the top Mux of the ALU.</p>
