  <p><b>Question 1.</b>  The <i>lw</i> instruction specifies
  <code>alpha($t0)</code> as the effective address, but
  <code>alpha</code> was assigned to memory address 0x10010000, which
  does not fit in the 16-bit Address field of a <i>lw</i> instruction. 
  So the assembler generated three instructions to compute the effective
  address in register $1 (also known as $at, the "assembler temporary"
  register).  The <i>lui</i> instruction has the leftmost 16 bits of the
  address 0x10010000 as its immediate operand (the rightmost 16 bits of
  the <i>lui</i> instruction); this 16-bit value gets loaded into the
  leftmost 16 bits of $at, and the rightmost 16 bits of $at are set to
  zero.  Since the address that alpha represents ends with 0x0000, the
  complete address of alpha has been loaded into $at by the <i>lui</i>
  instruction.  If the rightmost 16 bits of the address alpha represents
  were not all zeros, the assembler would have generated an <i>ori</i>
  instruction to put the correct value into $at bits 0:15.</p>

  <p>The second instruction is an <i>addu</i> (add unsigned) to add the
  contents of $8 (which is $t0, the register I used as the index into
  the alpha array) to $at.  The assember generated an unsigned add
  because that's what <i>lw</i> instructions do: the value in the
  Address field of the instruction (bits 0:15 of the instruction) are a
  signed value, but the contents of <i>rs</i> ($t0 in this case) are
  unsigned.  What's signed and what's unsigned is backwards from what
  you might intuit from an expression like "<code>alpha($t0)</code>"
  where you would think the array address (alpha) would be unsigned and
  the subscript (register $t0) would be signed.  But it makes sense when
  you think of the "Address" field of the instruction actually being a
  (signed) offset rather than the base address of the array.</p>

  <p>Finally, the assembler generated a conventional <i>lw</i>
  instruction using the complete effective address in $at for the
  <i>rs</i> register and zero for the offset.</p>

  <p><b>Question 2.</b>   The <i>li</i> instructions were turned into
  <i>ori</i> instructions with $zero (register $0, the pseudo-register
  that can't be changed and which always provides the value 0x00000000)
  as the <i>rt</i> register.  The assembler could have generated
  <i>addi</i> instructions, also with $zero for the <i>rt</i> register,
  with the same effect.</p>

  <p><b>Question 3.</b>  The <i>blt</i> instruction generated a
  <i>slt</i> instruction followed by a <i>bne</i>.  That is, the
  assembler used an <i>slt</i> instruction to compare the two registers,
  leaving the value 0 (false) or 1 (true) in register $at to indicate
  the result of the comparison.  Then the <i>bne</i> conditionally
  branched back to the top of the loop if the comparison was true.</p>
  
  <p>The SPIM assembler and simulator calculated the branch target
  address by subtracting the address of the target instruction
  (0x00400030) from the address of the <i>bne</i> instruction
  (0x0040048), a difference of negative 18 in hexadecimal or -24 in
  decimal.  But the difference between the addresses of two instructions
  will always end with two binary zeros, so the architecture specifies
  that the target address  field of the branch instructions drops those
  two bits and leaves the difference in word addresses rather than the
  difference in byte addresses in the instruction.  Thus, the
  hexadecimal code for the instruction is 0x1420fffa, rightmost sixteen
  bits are 0xFFFA, and the decimal value of this is -6, which is -24
  divided by 4.</p>

  <p>As discussed in class, there is a discrepancy between how the SPIM
  software handles branches and how they are done in Chapter 5.  Since
  the address of an instruction is provided by the PC register, the
  hardware calculates the branch target address by adding the address
  field of the instruction (sign extended and shifted left two places)
  to the PC.  The datapath in Chapter 5 of the book calculates the
  branch target address using the value of the PC after it has been
  incremented by 4 and thus points to the instruction <i>after</i> the
  branch instruction, but the simulator and assembler use the address of
  the branch instruction itself.  In class I used the terms "PC+4" and
  "PC" to talk about this difference.</p>

  <p><b>Question 4.</b>  38 clock cycles.  Each instruction takes
  exactly one clock cycle to execute.  There are three <i>li</i>
  instructions before the loop, and seven instructions inside the loop
  (three for the <i>lw</i>, an <i>add</i>, an <i>addi</i>, and two for
  the <i>blt</i>.  The instructions inside the loop get executed 5 times
  each.</p>
  
  <p><b>Question 5.</b>  Assuming the ALU control logic is extended so
  that an ALUOp input value of 11<sub>2</sub> causes the ALU function
  code to be based on the opcode field of the instruction instead of the
  func field, as discussed in class, the following will work:</p>
