<h2>Assignments</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

  <h3>Initial Background Assignments:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Read chapters 1 and 2 of the textbook on your own.  In addition
    to the background material in chapter 1, study chapter 2 well enough
    to understand the MIPS assembly and machine language.  But you do
    not need to read sections 2.7 through 2.20 for this course.</li>
    <li>Study all of Appendix B.</li>

    <li>If you are not familiar with CircuitMaker yet, read my <a
    href="../Circuit_Maker">Introduction to CircuitMaker</a> web page,
    download the software, and practice using it to construct and
    simulate a simple combinational logic circuit, such as a single full
    adder built from AND, OR, and Invert gates.</li>

    <li><b>Optional, but useful:</b> Read and do the exercises in what's
    currently available of "<a
    href="../Background_Material.pdf">Chapter 0</a>" from a text
    that I'm working on.  Any feedback you supply to me would be
    appreciated.  And it should provide you with a good review of
    material you <i>should</i> already be familiar with.</li>

<h2>Administrivia</h2>

<div class="whitebox">
  <ul>
  <li><b>Class Schedule</b>

    <p>The class is scheduled to meet Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6:30
    to 7:45 in SB A-103, with the following exceptions:</p>

      <ul>

        <li>There will be no class on Thursday, September 16 because
        the college will be closed for the Rosh Hashanah holiday.</li>

        <li>There will be <b>no class on Thursday, October 7</b>.  We
        will make up this missed class by extending the other class
        meetings of the term by three minutes each.</li>
        
        <li>The college will follow a Thursday class schedule on
        Tuesday, November 16.  But that won't affect us because our
        class meets on both Tuesdays and Thursdays.</li>

        <li>Tuesday December 14 follows a Wednesday schedule at the
        college. Our last class meeting therefore will be Thursday,
        December 9.</li>

        <li>The <b>final exam</b> is scheduled for <b>Thursday December
        16</b> from 6:15 to 8:15 PM.  Contact the Registrar's Office
        immediately if this is in conflict with any of your other
        exams.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><a href="../syllabus.html"><b>Course Syllabus</b></a>

      <ul>

        <li>This is the first semester we are using the text listed in
        the syllabus.  Be sure to get the <i>third edition</i> of this
        book, which is significantly different from the previous two
        editions.  Many homework assignments will come from the text,
        and you won't have access to them without a copy.</li>

        <li>A copy of the text will be placed on reserve in the library,
        but this may take some time because the book was published less
        than a month before the start of classes.</li>

        <li>The book is available from the QC Bookstore, as well as
        online.  For example, it is listed on Amazon.com for about
        $65.</li>

        <li>The links to last semester's exams in the syllabus will be
        of very limited use to you because a different textbook was used
        last semester, making the sequence of topics covered as well as
        the actual material within each topic totally different from
        this semester.  About the only way they might be useful is if
        you want to see what types of exams I give in general.</li>

        <li>The three <b>exams will each count 33% of your course
        grade</b>.  The number of homework assignments you submit will
        determine the other 1%.  Homework solutions will be posted
        immediately after the assignments are due, so late homeworks
        won't be accepted.</li>

      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><a href="./check_grades.html"><b>Check your grades for the
      course</b>.</a>
      <p><i>Once a grade for an assignment or an exam has been posted
      for one week it becomes permanent even if you discover an error
      after that.  So be sure to check that all exams and homeworks have
      been posted correctly as soon as they are available.</i></p>
