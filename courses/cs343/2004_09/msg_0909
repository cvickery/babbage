  Welcome to CS-343!

  By receiving this message, you know that I've added your email
  address to my mailing list for the course correctly.

  Note that messages I broadcast to the mailing list will have your
  name and the date in the body of the message.  So, personal as it
  may seem, messages that look like this are really standard messages
  that I'm sending to everyone in the course.

  You should put CS-343 as the first six characters of the Subject of
  all messages you send to me (not just assignments) to make sure your
  messages don't get consumed by my spam filter.  Be sure to
  capitalize the C and the S and to put a hyphen between the S and the
  3.

  And I'll use this opportunity to let you know that the web page for
  Assignment 2 is up now.  There is a link to it from the course web
  site.

  Dr. Vickery
