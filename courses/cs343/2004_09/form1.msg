  I made a mistake on the answer key for your form of the exam; it
  might either increase or decrease your grade.  If you send me
  the answers you gave for questions 2-11, I'll check how it affects
  you.  Or, you can just bring your scantron sheet to class next
  Tuesday.

  My apologies,
  Dr. Vickery
