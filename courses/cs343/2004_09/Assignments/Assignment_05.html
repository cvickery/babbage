<h1>CS-343 Assignment 5</h1>
<h2>Fall 2004</h2>

<h2>Due October 26</h2>
<div class="whitebox">

    <p>Your assignment is to write a MIPS assembly language program that
    adds up the integers in a 5-word array and writes the sum to the
    console.  Here is a skeleton assembly language file you can start
    with:</p>

    <pre>
              .globl    main
              .data
      alpha:  .word     [put five "interesting" integers here]
      
              .text
      main:   [write your code here]
      
      # Exit program
              li      $v0, 10
              syscall
              .end
    </pre>

    <p>Use pseudo-instructions to make your code easier to write.  For
    example, use <i>li</i> ("load immediate") to initialize registers,
    and <i>blt</i> ("branch less than") for the test at the end of the
    loop.</p>

    <p>Test your program using the SPIM simulator to make sure it works
    correctly.  Examine the code window carefully and make sure you
    understand all four columns contents fully.  (Help:  The first
    column contains the memory address inside square brackets, the
    second column contains the memory contents, the third column gives
    the assembly language representation of the instructions generated
    by the assembler with pseudo-instructions converted to real
    instructions and with register names converted to register numbers,
    and the fourth column contains the assemly language statements you
    wrote.</p>

    <p>Once your program is working and you have studied the code
    section of the SPIM window, do the following:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Tell what the <i>lw</i> pseudo-instruction at the top of the
      loop expands to, and explain what those three instructions do.</li>
      
      <li>Tell what instruction <i>li</i> turns into, and tell another
      real instruction the assembler could have used to accomplish the
      same thing.</li>
      
      <li>Explain the code generated for the <i>blt</i> instruction. 
      Explain why the address field of the <i>bne</i> instruction is
      different for columns 2 and 3 of the code window.  Tell exactly
      how the branch target address is computed for this
      instruction.</li>
      
      <li>Exactly how many clock cycles will it take to run this program
      from the time the instruction at main is executed to the time that
      the loop exits?  That is, ignore the four instructions for
      printing the results and exiting the program.</li>
      
      <li>Extend Figure 5.22 of the textbook by adding a columns for the
      following I-Format instructions:  <i>addi</i>, <i>andi</i>,
      <i>ori</i>, <i>slti</i>.</li>
      
      <li>Write the pseudocode for a function that that implements the
      control unit of the single-cycle MIPS processor developed in the
      first part of Chapter 5.  The argument passed to this function is
      a 32-bit integer with the value of the IR.  The result returned by
      the function is a "control word" with bits 8:0 set to the values
      of <i>RegDst</i>, <i>ALUSrc</i>, etc. for that instruction.  (See
      below).</li>
      
      <li><b>Optional:</b>  Translate your pseudocode into a real
      program and run it with column 2 of your SPIM code window as input
      values.  Here's what my version produced:</li>

    <p><b>Legend:</b>  The signal names are abbreviated to keep the
    lines short.  A stands for ALU, M stands for Mem, Rg stands for Reg,
    Rd stands for Read, Wr stands for Write, Ds stands for Dst, and Jmp
    stands for Jump (see below).  A value of '?' for a signal means that
    the instruction can't be handled by the datapath designed in the
    book; it would need additional features.  And a value of 'X' (there
    are none in the sample output above) means the value of the signal
    doesn't matter, but a real controller would have to generate either
    a 1 or a 0 in place of the X.</p>

    <p><b>Confessions:</b>  I captured the SPIM simulator's code window
    in a text file, and edited it so each line contained just columns 2
    (the address) and 3 (the assembly language) of one instruction, and
    my program prints this line as it reads it.  My program outputs a
    value for the Jump control signal developed just after Figure 5.22
    in the book.  The <i>syscall</i> instructions look like R-type
    instructions to my program, but that's not very meaningful.  And the
    immediate format instructions won't work unless the datapath is
    modified to get the correct function code into the ALU; just setting
    ALUOp to 10<sub>2</sub> won't actually work. (How would you have to
    change the datapath to handle the immediate format
    instructions?)</p>
