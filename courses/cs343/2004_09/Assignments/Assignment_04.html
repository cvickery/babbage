<h1>CS-343 Assignment 4</h1>
<h2>Fall 2004</h2>
</center>
<h2>Due October 14</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

  <p>Answer the following Exercises from the end of Chapter 5: <b>5.1,
  5.2, 5.3, and 5.13.</b></p>
  
  <p>Type your answers into a plain-text email message, and send it to
  either vickery##babbage.cs.qc.edu or vickeryqc##gmail.com by midnight
  of the due date.  (I'm using the gmail account as a backup for my
  babbage account these days; please submit the assignment to just one,
  not both.)  Be sure to include your name and 4-digit student ID at the
  <i>beginning</i> of your mail message.  Be sure the Subject line of
  your email is <b>CS-343&nbsp;Assignment&nbsp;4</b> capitalized and
  spaced exactly as shown.</p>

</div>

<h3>Optional Assignment</h3>

<div class="whitebox">

  <p>Do any of exercises 5.8, 5.9, 5.10, and 5.11.  Submit your answers
  on paper in class by <b>Tuesday, October 19</b>.  Each one you answer
  reasonably correctly will count as an extra homework assignment so you
  can possibly get more than 1 point for homeworks in your course grade.
  (If you submit 110% of the required homework assignments you would get
  1.1 points instead of 1.0 for that part of your course grade.)</p>
