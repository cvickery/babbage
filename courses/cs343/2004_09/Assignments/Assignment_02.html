<div class="whitebox">
  <p>Here is a logic circuit designed using CircuitMaker that is
  supposed to be a 4-bit counter that cycles through the values 0x0
  through 0xF on successive clock pulses.  There are four flip-flops
  labeled A<sub>3</sub> .. A<sub>0</sub>, a clock generator (on the
  left), and a hexadecimal display that shows the state of all four
  flip-flops.  But it only counts from 0 to 3 before going back to 0
  again.  Add more AND and OR gates to make it count all the way up to
  0xF before going back to zero.</p>
  
  <p><b>Note:</b>  You will have to reconstruct the entire circuit since I'm
  providing only a drawing of the circuit, not the actual CircuitMaker
  file.</p>
  
  <p>After you have completed your circuit and tested it using
  CircuitMaker (be sure to step through it one step at a time), save the
  .ckt file and email it to me as an attachment to your message.  The
  subject line of your email must be <b>CS-343 Assignment 2</b>, which
  must be capitalized and spaced exactly like that in order to be
  accepted.  Include your name and 4-digit student ID number in the body
  of your message.</p>
