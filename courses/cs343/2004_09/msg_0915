  I updated the CircuitMaker help page today.  I don't plan to give
  more CircuitMaker assignments this semester, but I'd appreciate it
  if you'd look at the updated page and let me know if you see any
  typos and/or have suggestions for improvements.  Both next
  semester's students and I would appreciate it.

  Also, I've posted my solution to Assignment 2.

  But I haven't put up assignment 3 yet.  I'll send another email when
  I do.

  See you next week,
  Dr. Vickery
