<h2>Introduction</h2>

<div class="whitebox">

  <p>As a review of state machine design for the first exam, we are
  implementing the design of a controller for a datapath.  The problem
  is based on an exercise that CS-345 students are doing this semester
  using actual hardware.  For this web page, I've modified the problem a
  little compared to how it was presented in class.</p>
  
  <p>The datapath consists of an arithmetic unit that can compute the
  sum of some numbers (it's not specified where the numbers come from),
  and push the sum into a 4-stage queue.  As sums exit the queue, they
  are displayed on a pair of seven segment displays.  Here's a rough
  diagram of the datapath:</p>

  <img src=datapath.png alt="Datapath Diagram" />
  <p class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 1.</b>  The datapath to be
  controlled.</p>

  <p>There are two signals that control the datapath: "add-and-shift"
  (<i>aas</i>) and "enable-displays" (<i>enb</i>). When <i>aas</i> is
  true, the datapath computes a new sum and shifts it into the queue. 
  When <i>enb</i> is true, the seven-segment displays show the value of
  the current value coming out of the queue; otherwise they are
  dark.</p>
  
  <p>There are two pushbuttons that control the operations of the
  datapath, B1 and B2.  When B1 is pressed, the datapath does a single
  add-and-shift regardless of how long the button is pressed.  B1 has to
  be released and pressed again to cause another add-and-shift operation
  to take place.  The seven-segment displays remain dark until the queue
  has filled up.  That is, until B1 has been pressed four or more times.
  Pressing B2 resets the device so that the displays go dark until the
  user presses B1 four more times.  Pressing B2 should reset the summing
  circuit too, but that is not part of our design.  (The datapath could
  be designed to reset the sum to zero when it is told to turn off the
  displays.)</p>
  
  <p>The controller also has two LEDs (light emitting diodes) it can
  turn on or off, L1 and L0.  The two LEDs indicate, in binary, which
  stages in the queue are currently occupied: When the LEDs are
  00<sub>2</sub>, it means that either the queue is empty, or that only
  stage 0 is occupied with a sum.  When the LEDs are  01<sub>2</sub>,
  stages 0 and 1 both contain sums. 10<sub>2</sub> means stages 0, 1,
  and 2 all contain valid sums, and 11<sub>2</sub> means that all four
  stages (0, 1, 2, and 3) contain valid sums.  The controller makes
  <i>enb</i> true so that the seven-segment displays light up only when
  stage 3 contains a valid sum.</p>

  <p>Here is a diagram showing the inputs and outputs of the
  controller:</p>
  
  <img src=controller.png alt="Controller Diagram" />
  <p class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 2.</b>  Controller inputs and
  outputs.</p>

</div>

<h2>The Design</h2> 

  <p>Remember, we are designing just the controller, not the datapath
  for this device.  So everything from here on has to do only with the
  design of the finite state machine (FSM) that acts as the Controller
  in Figure 2.</p>

<div class="whitebox">

  
  <p>As Figure 2 indicates, the controller has two external inputs, B1
  and B2, and four external outputs, L1, L0, <i>enb</i>, and <i>aas</i>.
  Before constructing the state table, we need to figure out how many
  states there will be.  In this particular example, there is a sequence
  of states, much like the counter examples we did before.  There have
  to be three states for each B1 press: one when B1 is pressed, a second
  while waiting for the button to be released, and a third while waiting
  for B1 to be pressed again.  Figure 3 shows how three states would be
  used to detect a press and release of B1, with the middle state used
  to generate a true value for <i>aas</i> for exactly one clock cycle no
  matter how long B1 is held.</p>

  <img src="edge_machine.png" alt="Button press detector" />

  <p class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 3.</b>  Three states used to
  detect the rising edge of B1 and to assert the <i>aas</i> output for
  exactly one clock period regardless of how long B1 remains true. 
  During State_0 the machine is waiting for B1 to go true.  When it
  does, the machine goes into State_1 for exactly one clock period,
  during which it asserts <i>aas</i>.  The machine then goes into
  State_2 where it waits for B1 to go false.  When B1 goes false, the
  machine goes to another state, where it waits for B1 to go true
  again.  (The next state after State_2 would be State_0 if this was the
  entire controller.)  The timing diagram below the state diagram shows
  the relationships between the inputs (Clock and B1), three signals
  that indicate the present state, and the value of the <i>aas</i>
  output.</p>

  <p>The timing diagram in Figure 3 is especially important to
  understand because it shows how state transitions always happen at
  the edge of a clock pulse.  We'll come back to the signals marked with
  the state names (State_0, State_1, State_2, ...) after we know how
  many different states our controller will need.  The following table
  gives a verbal summary of each state:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Description
      <th>Outputs
      
    <tr>
      <td>Initial state, waiting for first B1 press.  Return here any
      time B2 is pressed.
      <td>All off.
      
    <tr>
      <td>B1 pressed: Stay here for one clock pulse.
      <td>Assert <i>aas</i>, filling Stage 0 of the queue.  Both LEDs
      off.

    <tr>
      <td>Wait for B1 to be released.
      <td>All off.

    <tr>
      <td>Wait for B1 to be pressed a second time.
      <td>All off.

    <tr>
      <td>B1 pressed: Stay here for one clock pulse.
      <td>Assert <i>aas</i>, filling Stage 1 of the queue.  Assert L0.

    <tr>
      <td>Wait for B1 to be released.
      <td>Continue asserting L0.

    <tr>
      <td>B1 released: Wait for B1 to be pressed a third time.
      <td>Continue asserting L0.
      
    <tr>
      <td>B1 pressed: Stay here for one clock pulse.
      <td>Assert <i>aas</i>, filling Stage 2 of the queue.  Assert L1,
      but not L0.

    <tr>
      <td>Wait for B1 to be released.
      <td>Continue asserting L1.
      
    <tr>
      <td>B1 released: Wait for B1 to be pressed a fourth time.
      <td>Continue asserting L1.
      
    <tr>
      <td>B1 pressed: Stay here for one clock pulse.
      <td>Assert <i>aas</i>, filling Stage 3 of the queue.  Assert both
      L1 and L0 as well as <i>enb</i>.

    <tr>
      <td>Wait for B1 to be released.
      <td>Continue asserting L1, L0, and <i>enb</i>.

    <tr>
      <td>B1 released: Wait for B1 to be pressed again.
      <td>Continue asserting L1, L0, and <i>enb</i>.
 
  </table>

  <p>The bottom three states repeat every time B1 is pressed again. 
  Counting the rows, we see that we need 13 states.  (Not the 16 states
  I said would be used in class on 9/23.)  For anywhere between 9 and 16
  states, we need four "state flip-flops" to hold the encoded state. 
  We'll call these four flip-flops S<sub>3</sub>, S<sub>2</sub>,
  S<sub>1</sub>, and S<sub>0</sub>, and we'll name our states State_0,
  State_1, ... State_C, where the hexadecimal digit at the end of each
  state name matches the binary value represented by the settings of the
  four state flip-flops in that state.  At the end of this web page
  there is a section on "<a href="#one-hot">one-hot encoding</a>" that
  can be easier to implement than the design being developed here.  But
  for now, we'll use four flip-flops to represent which of the thirteen
  states is active at any time.</p>
  
  <h3>State Diagram</h3>
  
  <p>When designing a state machine, you have to be sure to account for
  all input possibilities when showing the transition arcs.  In this
  exercise, there are two input buttons, so we have to account for
  2<sup>2</sup> = 4 possibilities: ~B1^~B2, ~B1^B2, B1^~B2, and B1^B2.
  (I'm using '~' for NOT, '+' for OR, and '^' for AND.)</p>

  <img src="./arc_labeling.png" alt="Labeling FSM arcs" />
  <p class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 4.</b>  Three states with all arcs
  explicit.</p>
  
  <p>Figure 4 shows the same three states as Figure 3, but with all arcs
  drawn in and labeled.  The design says that pressing B2 at any point
  resets the controller, no matter whether B1 is pressed or not.  In our
  design, State_0 will be the state that the FSM returns to when B2 is
  pressed.  Start by noticing that both State_1 and State_2 have an arc
  back to State_0 marked "B2" to meet this design requirement.  In the
  full state diagram below (Figure 5), these arcs are drawn in red and
  not labeled to help reduce the clutter of the diagram.</p>
  
  <p>Looking at State_0 in Fig. 4, you can see two arcs coming out of
  it, one labeled ~B1+B2 and the other B1~B2.  In English, they say to
  return to State_0 on every clock pulse if B1 is not pressed or if B2
  is pressed, and to go to State_1 if B1 is pressed and B2 is not
  pressed.  By DeMorgan's Law, ~B1+B2 is ~(B1^~B2), so the two arcs
  together specify ~(B1^~B2)+(B1^~B2).  Since ~x+x = 1, the two arcs cover
  all four possible combinations of values for B1 and B2.</p>
  
  <p>For State_1, there are again two arcs exiting from the state, one
  labeled B2 and the other labelled ~B2, so again all four possible
  combinations of values for B1 and B2 are covered.  (In this case, the
  value of B1 doesn't matter.)  And for State_2, there are three arcs:
  B2, B1^~B2, and ~B1^~B2.  Since B2 alone covers both B1^B2 and ~B1^B2,
  all four combinations are again covered.</p>
  
  <p>We will adopt a common convention for our state diagrams: We won't
  draw the arc that loops back into a state (if one exists).  However,
  if the arcs that exit a state don't cover all possible combinations of
  input variables, such an arcs is implied to exist and will be used by
  the FSM whenever one of the unspecified input combinations happens. 
  (A common variation on this convention is to draw the loopback arc and
  to label it "else," but we'll just not draw it at all.)</p>

  <p>So, with all that background in place, here is the <b>state
  diagram</b> for our controller:</p>

  <img src="state_diagram.png" alt="State Diagram" />

  <p class="figure_caption" style="width:700px"><b>Figure 5.</b> State
  diagram for the controller. The green arrow going into State_0
  represents an initial transition that we assume occurs automatically
  when power is applied to the FSM.  The red arcs should all be marked
  "B1", but those labels are omitted to reduce clutter.  Wherever the
  outgoing arcs from a state do not account for all four possible
  combinations of values for the two input variables B1 and B2, there is
  an implcit feedback loop into the state that is taken for all the
  missing combinations.  For this diagram, such feedback arcs would
  apply for all states except 1, 4, 7, and A.</p>

  <p>This leads to a complete state table with the following
  headings:</p>
  <table>
    <colgroup span="6" style="background-color:#ffffcc"></colgroup>
    <colgroup span="4" style="background-color:#ccffcc"></colgroup>
    <colgroup span="4" style="background-color:#99ccff"></colgroup>
    <tr>
      <th colspan=2>Inputs
      <th colspan=4>Present State
      <th colspan=4>Next State
      <th colspan=4>Outputs
    <tr>
      <th>B2
      <th>B1
      <th>S<sub>3</sub>
      <th>S<sub>2</sub>
      <th>S<sub>1</sub>
      <th>S<sub>0</sub>
      <th>S<sub>3</sub>
      <th>S<sub>2</sub>
      <th>S<sub>1</sub>
      <th>S<sub>0</sub>
      <th>L1
      <th>L0
      <th><i>aas</i>
      <th><i>enb</i>
  </table>
  
  <p>Unfortunately, there are six variables on the input side (B1, B2,
  and the four state flip-flops), which means the full table will have
  2<sup>6</sup> = 64 rows, which we can't reasonably expect to fill in
  manually, to say nothing of minimizing the next state and output
  functions.  You should be able to do it if you had to, but it would be
  too big a chore to be a worthwhile way to spend one's time.</p>

  <h3>Output Logic</h3>

  <p>We start by taking advantage of the fact that we always design Moore
  Machines in this course.  That is, the outputs depend only on the
  present state, which means we can ignore B1 and B2 when determining
  the values of L1, L0, <i>aas</i>, and <i>enb</i>.  That reduces the
  number of inputs to 4, giving us a 16-row table to work with:</p>

  <table>

                    text-align:   left;

                    margin-left:  4em;">

  <p>The bottom three rows of this truth table have X's for the output
  variable values.  That's because the controller never actually enters
  any of these states, so we indicate that we don't care what the values
  are for those combinations of inputs.  The X's are entered into the
  Karnaugh Maps, just like the 1's and 0's in the other rows.  Where
  they occur, they may be included in a circle (treated as 1's) if that
  helps make the circle larger, thus helping the minimization.  But they
  don't have to be included in any circle (treated as 0's) if that helps
  the minimization by eliminating extra circles.  Remember, each circle
  in a Karnaugh map corresponds to an AND gate in the final circuit. 
  The larger the circle (the more squares included), the smaller the
  number of inputs to the corresponding AND gate.  And, of course, the
  fewer circles there are, the fewer the number of AND gates needed.</p>

  match the circles in the maps.</p>

    <h3>Next State Logic</h3>
    
    <p>Rather than wrestle with the full 64-row truth table for
    generating
    the next state values that will connect to the D inputs of the four
    flip=flops, we will use a 4x16 decoder to generate a separate signal
    for each state.  Three of the decoder outputs are unused, as shown
    in Figure 7.</p>

    <p class="figure_caption"><b>Figure 7.</b>  Decoding the state
    flip-flops to produce individual signal wires for all the
    states.</p>

    <p>The next step is to note all those states for which each state
    flip-flop is true.  For example, S<sub>0</sub> is true in all the
    odd-numbered states (State_1, State_3, State_5, etc.).  Likewise,
    S<sub>1</sub> is true in states State_2, State_3, State_6, State_7,
    etc.; S<sub>2</sub> is true in states State_4, State_5, State_6,
    State_7, etc.; S<sub>3</sub> is true in states State_8, State_9,
    State_A, State_B, and State_C.  If this isn't clear, just write out
    the four bit binary numbers from 0000<sub>2</sub> through
    1100<sub>2</sub> and observe which flip-flops are ones for each
    row.</p>
    
    <p>Now we can generate the next state equations for the four state
    flip-flops by examining Figure 5 and pretty much reading off the
    values.  For S<sub>0</sub> we look at all the arcs going into the
    odd-numbered states. remembering to include those feedback loops
    that aren't shown in Figure 5.  AND together the state each arc
    comes from along with the label on the arc, then OR all the AND
    terms together.</p>

    <p>The process of actually grinding the equations out is very
    tedious, but we can start the process to see what it looks like. 
    For example, to generate the D input for S<sub>0</sub> we would look
    at all the odd numbered states in Figure 5:</p>
    <ul>
    
    <li>State_1 is the first odd numbered state, and it has an arc
    coming from State_0 labeled B1^~B2, so one AND term is
    (State_0^B1^B2).  As the caption for Figure 5 mentions, State_1 is
    one of the states with no feedback loop, so this one AND term covers
    all the ways the controller can enter State_1, and becomes one of
    the terms in the equation for S<sub>0</sub>:
    <div class="whitebox">
    S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;<u>State_0^B1^B2&nbsp;</u>+&nbsp;...
    </div></li>

    <li>State_3 is the next odd numbered state, and it has an arc
    labeled ~B1^~B2 coming into it from State_2.  Examining the two
    arcs going <i>out</i> of State_3 in Figure 5 tells us that there
    must be a feedback loop for for the case when the button values are
    ~B1^~B2.  (The B2 arc handles B1^B2 and ~B1^B2, and the other arc
    handles B1^~B2, leaving the fourth input possibility, ~B1^~B2,
    uncovered.)  So analyzing State_3 adds two terms to the equation for
    S<sub>0</sub>, which now looks like this:
    <div class="whitebox">
    S<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;State_0^B1^B2&nbsp;+&nbsp;
    <u>State_2^~B1^~B2</u>&nbsp;+&nbsp;<u>State_3^~B1^~B2</u>&nbsp;...
    </div></li>

    <li>Now repeat similar steps for the other odd-numbered states, and
    you'll end up with a big sum of products expression for the D input
    for S<sub>0</sub>.</li>
    
    <li>Now repeat the above steps for the other three state
    flip-flops.</li>
    
  </ul>

  <p>There will be some algebraic minimizations that can be done by
  hand, but the message is clear: The next state logic for this
  controller is a big piece of work!  <i>But</i> the procedure should
  make <i>some</i> sense to you.</p>

  <h3><a name="one-hot">One Hot Encoding</a></h3>

  <p>The design approach above is intuitively appealing.  The number of
  flip-flops is minimal: <i>ceil( log<sub>2</sub>(N) )</i> for N states.
  The output logic is easy to generate, and the overhead of putting in a
  decoder to help generate the next state values actually gets "folded
  into" an actual design when software tools are used to generate the
  combinational logic.  And the relationships among the state diagram
  and the state table are straight-forward.</p>
  
  <p>There is an alternate approach that is often used, called "one hot
  encoding."  In this approach, there is a separate flip-flop for each
  state (13 instead of 4 for the controller we're using for our
  example).  It's called "one hot" because the controller has to be
  built so that exactly one flip-flop is true ("hot") at a time.  With
  the encoded design and a decoder it's automatic that exactly one of
  the State_<i>x</i> signals will be true at a time.  With a one hot
  design, once the bugs are out, the same thing will be true.</p>
  
  <p>The disadvantage of the one hot approach is that now we have to
  come up with 13 equations for flip-flop inputs instead of just 4.  The
  advantage is that these equations are much simpler:</p>
  
  <div class="whitebox">
    <p>State_0 = B2&nbsp;+&nbsp;State_0^~B1</p>
    <p>State_1 = B1^~B2^State_0</p>
    <p>State_2 = ~B2(State_1&nbsp;+&nbsp;State_2^B1)</p>
    <p>State_3 = ~B1^~B2(State_2&nbsp;+&nbsp;State_3)</p>
    <p>State_4 = B1^~B2^State_3</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>State_C = ~B1^~B2(State_B&nbsp;+&nbsp;State_C)</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>The above equations are specific to the particular example we are
  working on, but it will generally be the case that this design trades
  off a larger number of equations for the relative simplicity of each
  one.</p>

  <p>Likewise, the output functions become simple.  They are just the
  sums (ORs) of states in which each one is true:</p>

  <div class="whitebox">
    <p>L0 = State_4 + State_5 + State_6 + State_A + State_B +
    State_C</p>
    <p>L1 = State_7 + State_8 + State_9 + State_A + State_B +
    State_C</p>
    <p>aas = State_1 + State_4 + State_7 + State_A</p>
    <p>enb = State_A + State_B + State_C</p>
  </div>
  
  <p>If we were doing Mealy machine design, these equations would have
  B1 and B2 literals in them as well.  But we aren't, so we don't, and
  we're done!</p>

  <h3>Next State Logic: Conclusion</h3>
  
  <p>Which design approach should you use?  For this course the answer
  is "always use the encoded approach."  You will be tested on your
  ability to lay out the columns of the state table properly and to
  generate the next state and output functions, at least in principle,
  based on this design approach.</p>
  
  <p>But in the real world, if you were designing a state machine by
  hand, you'd probably use the one-hot approach.  And if you used a
  high-level tool such as a hardware description language (HDL) like
  Verilog or VHDL you would have tools available that would help you
  produce a good one hot design.  And if you use a hardware
  implmentation language (HIL) like Handel-C, the compiler will generate
  all your state machines for you!</p>
</div>

<h2>Handel-C Code</h2>

  <p>Here is what a Handel-C program would look like for our controller.
   Handel-C looks a lot like C or Java.  But when you declare variables,
   you have to tell how many bits they use.  And all the statements
   inside a <i>par</i> block get executed simultaneously.</p>
 
    <p>This code compiles, but doesn't really run because there is no
    mechanism here to change the values of B1 and B2.  But it gives you
    an example of a "program" that can be compiled into the gates and
    flip-flops of a state machine.</p>
