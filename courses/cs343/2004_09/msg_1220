  I've finally posted the grades for CS-343.  You can check
  yours from the course web page.

  About the final exam:  First of all, there were two
  correct answers to the question about latency: the latency
  doesn't change when you use a pipelined design, AND the
  latency expressed as a number of clock cycles increases by
  the depth of the pipleine.  I scored the exams to give
  credit for both answers, and my apologies for the
  confusion.  (But why didn't anyone point out the problem
  during the exam?!)

  Exam scores were low, so you will see two Exam 3 scores
  when you look at your grades, the raw score is the
  percentage of the 46 questions that you answered
  correctly, and the other Exam 3 score is what you got
  after I applied the curve.

  Also, you could have completed more than 100% of the
  homeworks; I divided the number submitted by 6 instead of
  7.  But remember, your course average is just the average
  of your three exam scores for 99% of the grade plus 1%
  based on the proportion of the homeworks you submitted.

  Finally, I'll mention that the translation from course
  average to letter grade is a mechanical process spelled
  out in the College Bulletin.  (But subject to rounding.
  For example, the Bulletin says 93-97 is an "A" but I take
  that to mean 92.5 to 96.5.  And I adjust the other grade
  ranges similarly.)

  Let me know immediately if you see that I've recording
  anything incorrectly for you.

  Good luck in your other courses, and best wishes for the
  holidays.
