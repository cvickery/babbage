  Reminder:  Assignment 7 was due on Dec 7th.  I had it right on the
  assignment page, but the course web page had a typo saying it
  wouldn't be due until the 17th.   So I'll accept it any time until
  the final exam.  Meantime, I've posted the answers.  If you haven't
  handed it in yet, you won't get credit for cutting and pasting my
  answers into your own homework!

  The final exam will be on the 16th in our regular classroom.  But it
  will start at 6:15 instead of 6:30, and won't end until 8:15 instead
  of 7:45.  Despite the longer amount of time available for the exam,
  it will be similar in length to the other two exams, and will count
  the same as they did.

  See you next week,
  Dr. Vickery
