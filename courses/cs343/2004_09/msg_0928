  It should be obvious from what I've said in class, but I
  want to be explicit:  The exam will cover chapters 1, 3,
  4, and Appendix B, with an emphasis on the topics actually
  covered in class.  Until just now, the course web page
  said chapters 1-4 and didn't mention Appendix B, and that
  wasn't right.

  Good luck on Thursday!
