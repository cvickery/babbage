  	<h1>CS-343 Assignment 2<br/>
    Due February 17</h1>
    <div id="content">
      <h2>Reading Assignment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
        	Sections 1-6 of Appendix C of the textbook, continued. We are skipping around some in class, and
          have already covered section C.6 in class even though we have not completed the design of the ALU yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember, if you studied some assembly language other than MIPS in your prerequisite for this course 
          (or if you 
          did, but your MIPS skills are rusty) study Sections 1-10 of Chapter 2 of the textbook. You will need to
          comfortable with this material when we finish Appendix C.
        </li>
        <li>
        	The textbook mentions (but does not cover) minimization, which is important for this assignment.
          There are many tutorials available on the web; the one I prepared is 
          <a href="../../Minimize/index.xhtml">Minimizing Boolean Functions</a>, which you should read before
          doing this assignment.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assignment To Hand In</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
        	This assignment requires you to draw schematic diagrams for logic networks. Unfortunately, we have
          not started using the software that we have available for creating these schematics, so you will
          have to draw your diagrams on paper and bring the assignment to class with you on the due date.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be sure to put your name on your assignment paper so I know who submitted
          it.
        </p>
        <p>There are sixteen possible functions of two boolean variables:</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <ol>
          <li>
          	How many possible functions of three boolean variables are there?
          </li>
          <li>
            How many four variable functions are possible?
          </li>
          <li>
            What is the expression that relates the number of input variable to the number of
            possible boolean functions?
          </li>
          <li>
            For each of the sixteen two-input functions:
            <ol>
              <li>Draw a Karnaugh Map to minimize the function</li>
              <li>
                Using only AND, OR, NOT, 0, 1, and wires, draw a schematic diagram that implements each
                minimized function. (For 0 you may use the symbol for ground; for 1 you may use “Vcc.”
                Or you can simply use 0 and 1 as input values where you need them.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Examine each function, and where the function has a name, tell what the name is. For example,
                the name of Y<span class="subscript">1</span> is “AND.” Y<span class="subscript">2</span>
                Y<span class="subscript">4</span>, Y<span class="subscript">11</span>, and
                Y<span class="subscript">13</span> are the only four that you might not be able to name.
                (In formal logic they are variants of “implication.” a implies b if a is false or b is true:
                function Y<span class="subscript">13</span>.)
              </li>
