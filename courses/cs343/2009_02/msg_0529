  I expect to post the grades for the course later this evening.

  In the meantime, there are several logic kits that have not been returned to
  the department office yet. If you have one, please return it immediately. If
  you have one but cannot return it to the college right away, please let me
  know so I will at least know its status.

  Thanks,
  Dr. Vickery
