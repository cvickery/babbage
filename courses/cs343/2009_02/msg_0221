  This is the first message I'm sending to CS-343 students using my
  mailing list this semester, so please let me know: if your name is
  spelled incorrectly above; if this message got to you but you are not
  registered for CS-343; or if you did not receive this message!

  The web page for Assignment 2 is finally ready; there is a link to it
  from the course schedule page. The due date is Thursday.

  The first exam in the course is scheduled for Tuesday, March 3.

  Let me know if you missed the user name and password for the course
  discussion board and exam archive, which I gave out in class.

  Dr. Vickery
