  I've had requests to postpone tomorrow's exam until Thursday. Although the
  snow is giving you an excellent opportunity to spend more time studying (!),
  it is also preventing most people from working on Assignment 3.

  So I'm postponing the exam and changing the due date for Assignment 3 to
  Thursday. There will be a regular class tomorrow (unless the college closes
  again, which is unlikely); I'll answer questions about the assignment, and
  start going over the first post-exam topic: design of the MIPS register file.

  Keep warm!
