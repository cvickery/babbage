  Three pieces of business:

  1.  Course evaluations are being done online this
  semester. This is a Big Deal because it means that
  potentially there will be a lot more information out there
  for providing both faculty feedback (we really do look at
  this stuff) and helpful information for potential
  students. Did you know that the results of past
  evaluations (the bubble-sheet forms) are already available
  online at http://courses.qc.cuny.edu?

  The period for doing evaluations this semester is from
  November 24 through December 11. You get entered into a
  raffle for each course you evaluate (free on-campus parking,
  bookstore credits, free campus food, and movie tickets are
  the prizes). They keep track of whether or not you do your
  evaluations (so you can evaluate only the courses you are
  registered for and you can't evaluate the same course
  twice), but otherwise it's totally anonymous.

  So log in to http://www.qc.cuny.edu/courseevaluation right
  away and give your feedback on all the courses you are
  taking this semester.

  2. Assignment 5 is finally ready; there is a link to it on
  the course schedule page now. Due date is next Tuesday.

  3. Happy Thanksgiving!
