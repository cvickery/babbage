  Assignment 6, which also tells what parts of chapters 6-8
  will be covered on the final exam, is posted on the web
  site now.

  Also, please note that the cutoff date for doing course
  evaluations has been extended to the last day of classes.
  Please take the time to do your evaluations: it helps your
  fellow students, it helps the faculty, and you get a
  chance win an iPod or other prize for each of your courses
  that you evaluate. http://www.qc.cuny.edu/courseevaluation
