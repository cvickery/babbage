There are two parts of the course web site that require you
to give a user name and password: the Exam Archive and the
Discussion Board. (There are links to both near the top of
the Course Schedule web page.) In both cases, the user name
is vickery-student and the password is Fall2008. Both are
case sensitive. If you want to post messages on the
Discussion Board, you will also need to create a user
account, which is a separate matter from just being able to
access the Board. Let me know if you have any questions or
if anything doesn't work.
