  I've posted tentative grades for the course. They are
  "tentative" because I still need to check them over to
  make sure I haven't made any scoring errors before
  submitting them to the registrar.

  In general, people did not do well on the final exam, and
  I ended up applied a curve: There were 44 questions, but I
  counted each one wrong as only 2 points; then I subtracted
  from 106 instead of 100. This gave a class average of 72,
  which was still low compared to the class averages of 84
  and 77 on the first two exams. When you look at your
  grades online, you will see a row marked "E3 X" -- that's
  how many questions you missed (out of 44) on the final
  exam; I gave partial credit wherever possible, so those
  numbers are shown to two decimal places.

  There is an "Assignments" row that tells what percentage
  of the assignments you completed. It was possible to score
  over 100% here because Assignments 3a and 3b were extra
  credit, and a grade of "good" counted extra too. The
  average score on assignments was 84%.

  I've also shown your class rank on each of the three exams
  and overall. The lowest rank was 20 for the first exam,
  but for the other two exams and for the course, the lowest
  rank was 19.

  For your course grade, assignments counted 10%, and each
  exam counted 30%. Converting course grades to letter
  grades is a mechanical process dictated by the college's
  grading policy.

  Overall, there were 3 A's, 6 B's, 6 C's, 3 D's, and 1 F.

  Best wishes to everyone for a Happy New Year,
  Dr. Vickery
