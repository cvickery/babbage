<p>Computer memories are typically built with capacities that are
powers of two  because it makes address decoding more efficient than
using decimal values.  Because 2<sup>10</sup> (1,024) is approximately
equal to 10<sup>3</sup> (1,000),  the prefixes orginally adopted for
the various powers of ten have also been  adopted for the
approximately-equivalent powers of two. That is why there are  two
"Exponent" columns and, correspondingly, two "Decimal Value"
columns.</p>

<p class="block">But note that disk memories do not follow this
convention. A 1 gigabyte disk  would contain just 1,000,000,000 bytes,
not 1,073,741,824 bytes. Cynics would  claim that disk manufacturers
are overstating their drives' capacities compared  to main memory
manufacturers. But it's also true that there is nothing in the 
organizational structure of disks that would suggest using powers of
two, the  way there is for main memory.</p>

<p>Because of the confusion over whether a particular prefix refers to
a power of two or not, the International Electrotechnical Commission
(IEC) adopted a distinct set of prefix names for the power of two
quantities.  For example, a "gibi" ("gigabinary") is used for
2<sup>30</sup> and "giga" is reserved for 10<sup>9</sup>.  However,
these binary prefixes are not widely used yet, and the power of ten
prefixes continue to be used widely in both decimal and binary
contexts.  The NIST gives a <a
href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">full list of the
binary prefixes</a> and tells how to pronounce them.</p>

<p>You do not need to memorize the exact decimal values of the binary
powers of two.</p>

<p>Fractional binary numbers do not typically use the scientific
prefixes the way the integer values do, and thus are not listed
here.</p>

<p>In this course the most common use of fractional decimal numbers
will be when discussing units of time.  Thus, one nanosecond is one
billionth of a second, which is 1&nbsp;*&nbsp;10<sup>-9</sup> second. 
Remember the reciprocal relationship between numbers with positive and
negative exponents:  A clock with a frequency of one Gigahertz has a
period of one nanosecond.  A clock with a 2 nanosecond period has a
frequency of 0.5 Gigahertz, which is 500 Megahertz.</p>
