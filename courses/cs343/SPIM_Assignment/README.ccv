
The assignment is for the students to write a subroutine that adds up
an arbitrary number of words of memory:
  $a0 Address of first word
  $a1 Number of words
  $v0 Sum returned

I supply driver.s, which reads lines from the console until EOT (^D)
and then calls their routine and diplays what they think the sum is.
