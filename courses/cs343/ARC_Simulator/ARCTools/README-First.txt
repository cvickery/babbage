This directory contains all the files needed to run the Java versions of
the ARC Assembler, Disassembler, and Simulator, along with an examples
directory containing some sample ARC programs.

These programs are Java applications, generated by jdk1.1.3.
In order to run these applications, the Java 1.1 runtime environment
must be installed and PATH and CLASSPATH environment variables set
appropriately.  See the Java documentation for your specific platform
for details.

Because Java was designed to be platform-independent, these programs
should run on any computer that has a Java Runtime Environment installed.
Java Runtime Environments available for a number of platforms,
including Windows 95, Windows NT, SunOS, Solaris, Linux and several other
Unix variants, and the Macintosh.  There are, however, several differences
in the behavior of Java applications when run on the various platforms.  

For information on supported platforms, and to download the Java Runtime
Environment for your platform, see http://www.javasoft.com.  For the


Quick Start for Unix and PC users: 

cd to the directory containing the ARCTools jar
file, and type

java -classpath ARCToolsv1.x.x.jar ARCTools.ARCSim

where x.x represents the current version of the tools. For example
at the time of this writing the current version is ARCToolsv1.2.5.jar

Unix users should set their CLASSPATH variable to this path.
Windows users of the JDK may do likewise. Windows users of the Java JRE
should invoke

jre -classpath path/to/this/directory/ARCToolsv1.x.x.jar ARCTools.ARCSim

Where x.x represents the current version of the tools. For example
at the time of this writing the current version is ARCToolsv1.2.5.jar
