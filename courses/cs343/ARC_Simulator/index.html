<h1>The ARC Simulator</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The authors of the textbook have provided a Java program to simulate
the ARC processor.  You can enter assembly language statements, and the
simulator will translate them into machine language, and you can then
simulate the execute of the machine language program, observing the
changes in memory and registers as each instruction is executed.</p>

<p>To use the simulator, you must have the Java runtime environment
installed on your computer.  You need to be able to run the Java
compiler by typing the <i>java</i> command at a DOS prompt before
trying to use the simulator.</p>

<h2>Downloading and Running the Simulator</h2>

<p>Once you have Java working, you can click on <a
href="./arc_tools.zip">this link</a> to download a zip file that
you should save to your hard disk.  Unzip the file into a convenient
directory, and you will get two subdirectories, one called ARCTools,
and the other called Examples.  The ARCTools dirctory contains the
simulator in a jar file, and several README text files that you will
have to study to learn how to use the simulator.  The Examples
directory contains sample assembly language programs you may try with
the simulator.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The version of the jar file has changed from 1.2.5 to
1.2.8 as of February 2004.  Be sure you use the newer version.  The old
version is also included in the zip file in case you want to work with
it.  There are improvements in the newer version, but it does not handle
all the op codes that the old one did.</p>

<p>If you have Java 1.2 or later installed on your
computer, you can just double-click on the jar file to run the
simulator.  Or, from a command line you can enter:</p>

<p class="indent"><i>java -jar ARCToolsv1.2.8.jar</i></p>

<p>If you are running an earlier version of java, you will
have to use the command given in the README-ARCSimulator.txt file to
run it:</p>

<p class="indent"><i>java&nbsp;-cp&nbsp;ARCToolsv1.2.8.jar&nbsp;ARCTools.ARCSim</i></p>

<p>Also, I have edited the Example files so they are formatted a bit
more nicely than the originals (I changed tabs to spaces so the code
would line up properly), and I changed some of the code so it ends
with a "halt" instruction instead of a "jmpl" that would work only if
the code had been invoked as a subroutine.  But the examples remain
undocumented.</p>
