  As some of you have discovered, I posted the grades for
  CS-343 last night. I still have to check them over again
  before submitting them to the registrar, but I expect that
  these are the final grades for the course.

  There were six required homework assignments, which
  counted 2 points each, for 12% of the course grade. But
  you could actually get more than full credit for those
  assignments: a score of "good" counted as 2.5 points
  instead of 2.0. A score of "not ok" counted as 1. The
  other 88% of your course grade was the average of your two
  exam grades; if you did the optional assignment and the
  score on it was better than the average of the two exams,
  that 88% was the average of the two exams and the optional
  project.

  By and large, the class did well: 6 A's, 2 B's, 3 C's, and
  2 D's.

  Best wishes for a Happy New Year and good winter break!
