  For those of you working on the optional project, here is
  a change in the requirements: Getting the clocking right
  for the register file is "tricky" (see below). So I am now
  saying you do not have to get your register file working
  perfectly before moving on to try other modules. If it is
  not working perfectly, you can simply substitute my
  Verilog implementation back into the design when you start
  working on other parts. But I will expect to find a Step_3
  directory so that I can evaluate the work you did do on
  that part of the project.

  "Tricky" means that operating the CPU clock from Key0
  produces very slow clock pulses that are not synchronized
  with the 27 MHz FPGA clock. The trick is getting exactly
  one brief clock pulse delivered to the alt3pram you used
  in your register file each time RegWrite (which is
  synchronized with the CPU clock) goes true. Sorry, but I
  don't have a quick and reliable fix that I can distribute.

  Good luck, and happy holidays!
