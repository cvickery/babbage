  Exam grades are posted, but not course grades yet; I
  haven't graded the optional projects yet.

  There were 36 questions on the exam. You could get partial
  credit for some of the questions. The "E2 Errors" row
  shows how many questions you missed out of 36, with the
  class range going from 2.1 to 14.7. I computed the exam
  scores as (E2E-2)/0.36, where E2E is your "E2 Errors".
  This gave an exam average of 81.5. There were 3 A's, 4
  B's, 4 C's, and 2 D's on the exam.

  I'll send another email when the final grades are ready.
