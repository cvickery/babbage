  A student in the class has come up with a solution to the
  Register File problem, which involves reworking the
  alt3pram that we used as the basis for the register file.
  He writes:

  1.  In the megawizard, instead of one clock bring two
      clocks (Key_0 and FPGA)
  2.  Select multiple clock options separate for read and
      write
  3.  Connect CPU_Clock to write alt3 clock; connect
      FPGA_Clock to read alt3 clock.
  
  This is certainly a lot simpler than the approach I was
  working on. Thanks!
