  1. There is a list of exam topics posted on the course web
  site. Rest assured, there is no way that every topic can
  actually be tested in a two-hour exam. (But I'll try!)

  2. The zip file for the optional project had a problem in
  the top-level symbol file because of an incompatibility
  between the Quartus version I am using and the one
  installed in the lab. I've uploaded what I think is a
  fixed version just now. (Monday evening.)

  3. The pictures Smitha took at the end of the last class
  are on the course web site now, too.  Thanks Smitha!
