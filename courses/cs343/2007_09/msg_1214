  If you are interested in borrowing a DE1 to take home
  while working on the optional assignment, let me know by
  return email. If there are enough of them on hand to meet
  the demand, I will instruct the CS Dept. office to let
  them out to the people who respond.

  Note that you will be responsible for replacing the unit
  ($150) if it gets lost or broken while you have it, and
  you will not get a grade for the course until it is
  returned.
