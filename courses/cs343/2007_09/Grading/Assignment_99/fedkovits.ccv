  Found four project directories, named Optiona, Optional,
  Optional Assignment, and Optional Assignment2.

  Optional has ALU without register file, but the ALU always
  generates zeros.

  Optional Assignment2 has ALU and Register File, but Key0
  is not connected to anything, so the device cannot be
  tested.

  The ALU, despite its non-functionality, looks basically
  correct.

  Project score: 85
