<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>The purpose of this page is to give you some practice with the
concepts and variables involved in storing physical-world stimuli as
digital information.  These variables include <I>transducers</I>,
<I>analog/digital and digital/analog conversion</I>,
<I>quantization</I>, and <I>encoding</I>.</P>

<DL>
    <DT>Transducer

    <DD>A device that converts energy from one form to another.  For
    example, a microphone is a transducer that converts sound waves in
    the air into voltages that are proportional to the sound pressure
    level of the sound waves.  The voltage that comes from a microphone
    is called an <I>analog signal</I> because its level continuously
    varies as a direct analog to the intensity of the sound pressure
    level strking the microphone.<p>

    Similarly, a loudspeaker or earphone is a transducer that converts
    analog voltages into sound waves.<p>

    <DT>Analog to Digital (A/D) Converter

    <DD>An electronic device that converts continuously varying
    voltages on a wire (such as the output of a microphone) into binary
    numbers.<p> <center><IMG src="AD_CONV.gif" alt="A/D
    Converter"></center> (This diagram comes from <A
    href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/">The Techweb
    Encyclopedia</A>.)<p>

    The exact format of the binary information that comes out of an a/d
    converter differs from device to device.  But you can think as the
    a/d converter as a black box with one wire that brings the analog
    voltage into it and with <I>n</I> wires coming out of it, which
    continuously carry voltages representing binary ones and zeros. 
    The converter discriminates among 2<sup><I>n</I></sup> voltage
    levels on the input wires, and always outputs the appropriate
    <I>n</I>-bit number representing the present input voltage.<p>

    <I>For Example:</I> Assume an A/D converter is designed to handle
    analog voltages that vary between -1.0 and +1.0 volts and that
    it has two wires for the binary outputs.  This means that it would
    differentiate among four different input voltage levels as
    follows:<p>

    <CENTER><TABLE CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1 WIDTH=200 >
    <TH>Analog voltage in
    <TH>Binary number out
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">-1.0 to -0.5
      <TD ALIGN="center">0&nbsp;0
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">-0.5 to 0.0
      <TD ALIGN="center">0&nbsp;1
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">0.0 to +0.5
      <TD ALIGN="center">1&nbsp;0
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">+0.5 to +1.0
      <TD ALIGN="center">1&nbsp;1
    </TABLE></CENTER><p>

    Although both the input and outputs of an A/D converter are
    electrical voltages, the input voltage varies continuously in time,
    whereas the voltages of the output wires always have just one of
    two different values, one of which represents a binary zero and the
    other of which represents a binary one.<p>

    <DT>D/A Converter
    <DD>A digital to analog converter, as its name implies, converts
    binary numbers into analog voltages that are proportional to the
    magnitude of the binary number at its input.  Note that a D/A
    converter doesn't generate a continuously varying voltage; it
    generates one of 2<sup><I>n</I></sup> voltages, depending on the
    value of the <I>n</I>-bit binary number input to it.

    In this diagram, the waveform on the right is only a crude
    approximation of the original analog signal, on the left.  This
    page deals with the parameters that affect how well the waveform
    coming out of the D/A converter approximates the one going into the
    A/D converter.<p>

    <DT>Quantization
    
    <DD>The term quanization refers to the use of discrete values to
    represent continuous variables.  For digital quantization, the two
    variables are the two axes of an analog sound wave. The X axis is
    time, and the Y axis is voltage.  Both of these axes must be
    divided into discrete values in order to store the analog signal in
    digital form.<p>

    The time axis is divided by a process called <I>sampling</I>: The
    output of the A/D converter is recorded at periodic intervals.  The
    time between samples is called the <I>sampling interval</I>, and
    its reciprocal (the number of samples per second) is called the
    <I>sampling frequency</I> or rate.  The higher the sampling rate,
    the finer-grained the quantization, and the more accurately
    temporal changes in the input signal can be recorded.<p>

    The granularity of the voltage axis depends on the number of bits
    that the A/D converter uses to encode voltages.  In the example
    given above, the A/D converter had two output wires, giving
    2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 voltage ranges for the quantization
    granularity.  The more bits output by the A/D converter, the
    smaller the quantization granularity, and the more accurately the
    signal's intensity can be approximated.<p>

    <DT>Encoding
    
    <DD>In the case we are considering, encoding refers to how binary
    numbers are assigned to analog voltage ranges, a process performed
    by the A/D converter.  Assume that the total possible range of input
    voltages is divided into 2<sup><I>n</I></sup> equal-sized intervals,
    and assume that the lowest interval maps to a value of zero, the
    highest interval maps to the value 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1, and
    that intermediate intervals map to corresponding intermediate
    values.  The table above is an example of this type of encoding.

<H2>Audio Sampling Laboratory</H2>

It's only a "virtual laboratory," but you can run a program that
simulates conversion of a sine wave from analog to digital and back
while observing the effects of the sampling rate and bits per sample on
the shape of the output waveform.  You'll need to have the current
version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) or Java Runtime Environment
(JRE) to run the program.  Current versions of Windows come with the
necessary software already installed.  If you don't already have it,
you can get it for free from [&nbsp;<a HREF="http://java.sun.com">Sun
Microsystems</A>&nbsp;].  You will have to sign up for the Java Developer
Connection before you can download their software, but that's free
too.<p>

Once you have Java installed, [&nbsp;<a HREF="AudioSampling.jar">click
here</A>&nbsp;] to download a file named <B>AudioSampling.jar</B>, and
save the file in some directory (folder) on your hard drive.  Then
start a "Command Prompt" window and change to that directory using the
<I>cd</I> command.  To run the program, give the command:<BR>
<PRE>
  java&nbsp;-cp&nbsp;AudioSampling.jar&nbsp;AudioSampling
</PRE>

You can specify initial values for the signal frequency, sampling rate,
and bits per sample at the end of the command line.  For example, if
you want to start with a sampling rate of 8 KHz, add "rate=8" at the
end of the line.  The quotation marks are optional, but you need them
if you put any spaces around the equal sign.  Use bitspersample to
specify the number of bits per sample, and use frequency to specify the
signal frequency.  You can abbreviate the keywords if you don't want to
type them out.<p>

When the program runs, you can adjust the sampling rate and the bits
per sample using the slider controls at the bottom, using either the
mouse or the arrow keys.  You can also re-size the window at any
time.<p>
