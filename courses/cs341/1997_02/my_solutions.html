  <DT>1.  <B>February 7</B><DD>Exercises 2.14, 2.15, 2.16, 2.17, 2.18, 2.19.<p>

<pre>
  2.14  Multiply the CPI for each instruction class by its relative
        frequency (per cent divided by 100), and sum the results.
        The answers are 2.80 for <i>Mbase</i> and 2.45 for <i>Mopt</i>.
      
  2.15  MIPS = instr / sec / 1,000,000
             = (clk / sec) * (instr/clk)
             = 50 / 2.80 = 17.86 for <i>Mbase</i>
             = 60 / 2.45 = 24.49 for <i>Mopt</i>

  2.16  Execution time = instr * cpi / cps Both machines execute the same
        number of instructions, so you can use any value for <i>instr</i>,
        such as 1.  Likewise, it doesn't effect the relative performances
        if we divide the cps by a million, so:

        Time for <i>Mbase</i> is 1 * 2.80 / 50 = 0.056 sec
        Time for <i>Mopt</i>  is 1 * 2.45 / 60 = 0.041 sec
      
        The ratio is 1.37, so <i>Mopt</i> is 37% faster.

  2.17  Multiply each of the CPI terms by its new frequency, and sum.  The
        answer is 2.51.

  2.18    2.51 / 50 = 0.05015
        0.056 / 0.05015 is 1.117, so <i>Mcomp</i> is 11.7% faster.

  2.19  CPI for <i>Mboth</i> is 2.1875 (See 2.17).  So execution time for
        <i>Mboth</i> is 2.1875 / 0.0365.  Divide this into execution time
        for <i>Mbase</i> to get 1.536, so <i>Mboth</i> is 53.6% faster
        than <i>Mbase</i>.

<pre>

  3.19  for (i = 0; i <= 100; i++) a[i] = b[i] * c;

        There are many correct solutions.  This one assumes the authors
        really meant the loop to go for 101 iterations.  It also assumes
        that the value of <i>i</i> does not have to be kept during the
        loop, so we can just compute successive values of 0, 4, 8, etc.
        for the index into the two arrays.
      
              add   $15, $0, $0         # Register 15 will be i * 4
        loop: slti  $1, $15, 404        # 404 is 4 * 101
              beq   $1, $0, exit
              lw    $8, 2000($15)       # b[i]
              add   $8, $8, $16         # + c
              sw    $8, 1500($15)       # a[i] =
              addi  $15, $15, 4         # i++
              j     loop
        exit:
        
        There are seven instructions in the loop, and one outside it, so a
        total of 707 + 1 = 708 instructions will be executed.
        
        Two of the instructions make data references (lw and sw), and
        each is executed 101 times, so there are 202 data references.

  3.20  A)  The table says that 33% of the instructions make data
        references in <i>gcc</i>, and we know that 100% of the
        instructions are fetched into the cpu by accessing memory,
        so 33 / 133 = 0.248 (24.8%) of all memory accesses are for data.

        B)  All memory accesses to fetch instructions are reads, and 2/3
        of the 33% of the data references are reads, so the percentage
        of all memory access that are reads is 22 / 133 = 92%

  3.21  A)  41 / 141 = 29.1%
        B)  27.3 / 141 = 19.3%

  <DT>3.  <b>February 21</B><DD>Translate the instruction "<code>beq
  3,4,somewhere</code>" to hexadecimal.  Assume the instruction is at
  decimal address 1020 and that the label "<code>somewhere</code>"

<pre>
    Since the PC register will have been incremented by four when the
    instruction is executed, the target address will be 996 - 1024 =
    -28, which must be divided by four to convert the distance from
    number of bytes to number of words between the target and the PC.

  <DT>4.  <B>February 28</B><DD>Exercises B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B10, B11,
  B12.<p>
<pre>

  B1.  First, note that there are 2^n entries, not 2n.  The proof is
  that each input can take on two values, so the truth table has to
  list all combinations, which is 2x2x2x ... x2.
  B2.  Covered in class
  B3.  This is a sixteen row truth table.  Each row must contain an even
  number of 1s, which you do by making the output 0 or 1 as necessary.
  The sixteen outputs, in order, are: 0110 1001 1001 0110, which is the
  same as the exclusive or of four variables.
  B4.  Use the sum of products implementation technique described in
  class.  There should be 8 AND gates with a fan-in of 4 each, plus one
  OR gate with a fan-in of 8.
  B5.  Because of Figure B.6 in the book, this could look just like
  your answer to B4 and still be "correct."  Better would be to make a
  diagram like Figure B.7 with eight horizontal lines in the AND plane,
  8 vertical lines connecting the AND plane and the OR plane, and one
  horizontal line in the OR plane.
  B6.  A   B   ~A  ~B   ~(AB)  ~A+~B  ~(A+B)  ~A~B
       0   0    1   1     1      1       1      1
       0   1    1   0     1      1       0      0
       1   0    0   1     1      1       0      0
       1   1    0   0     0      0       0      0
                          ^-same-^       ^-same-^
  B10.  The trick is that ~(A+A) is the same as ~A.  That is, you can
  make an inverter out of a NOR gate.  Then you can use these inverters
  made out of NOR gates and DeMorgan's Theorem to construct the AND and
  OR gates.
  B11.  ~(AA) is ~A too, so you can do the same thing as B10.
  B12.  You can use the constants zero and one as data inputs to a
  multiplexor.  If you put zero into the one input, one into the zero
  input, and a data value into the S input, you will have an inverter.
  If you put zero into the zero input, A into S, and B into the one
  input, you will get AND.  A OR B is A into S, B into zero, and one
  into one.

  <DT>5.  <B>March 25</B><DD>Do Exercise 4.1.  Translate 1.23 into a
  single-precision IEEE-794 floating-point number.<p>

       Unsigned integer:  2,414,854,144
       Floating-point:    -1.873 * 2^(-96) = -2.364 * 10^(-29)
       1.23:              0x3F9D70A4 (last bit is rounded up)

  <DT>6.  <B>March 28</B><DD>Implement a ~S ~R latch using four NAND
  gates.  Draw a "truth table" to describe its operation, and draw a
  timing diagram to illustrate its behavior.<p>

<pre>
  We went over this one carefully in class on April 4.

  <DT>7.  <B>April 11</B><DD>Complete the design of a 32M x 12 memory
  system using 8M x 4 SRAM ICs that was begun in class on April 8.<p>

<blockquote><code>

    You should have a matrix of four rows and three columns of SRAM
    ICs. There are 25 Address lines; 23 go to each of the SRAMs, the
    other two go to a 2x4 decoder, whose outputs go to the CS inputs of
    all the SRAMS in a row.  See the <A HREF= "../memory_system">Memory
    System Design</A> web page for an example of how to label
    everything.
