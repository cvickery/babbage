<H1 align=center>CS-341 Assignments, Spring 1997</H1>

<B>Note:</B>  Homework assignments for this course are graded, which
means that you must hand in your own work.  It's all right to talk with
others about the assignments, but you must do the exercises yourself. 
The rule to follow is that there must be no exchange of written
(electronic or otherwise) solutions between people.  Failure to abide by
this policy will result in failure in the course!<p>

Homework assignments are due on the date indicated, but will be accepted
for "late" credit until the next class after the due date.  I use the
following grades for homework:<BR>

<PRE>
    <B>Good</B>   4 points
    <B>OK</B>     3 points (full credit)
    <B>Not OK</B> 2 points
    
    <B>Late</B>   Subtract 1 point from above
</PRE>

At the end of the term, I will sum all your homework grades and compute
an average that will count approximately 10% of your course average.<p>
