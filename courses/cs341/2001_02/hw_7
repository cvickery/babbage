Here are the solutions for Homework 7.
Dr. Vickery


  7.  Inputs D1, D2, D4, and D7 are all connected to the plus side of
  the power supply (logic 1), and the other inputs are all connected to
  ground (logic 0).

  8.  The idea is that you can use any three of the variables as control
  intputs to the multiplexor, let's say variables A, B, and C.  Then
  each of the 8 inputs of the multiplexor will represent two rows of the
  truth table, one where D is zero and one where D is one.  These row
  pairs will either have output values of 0 and 0 (put 0 into the
  corresponding input of the multiplexor), 0 and 1 (put D into the
  corresponding input), 1 and 0 (put ~D into the corresponding input)
  or 1 and 1 (put 1 into the corresponding input.)  For the problem
  given, and using A, B, and C as the controls, the inputs to the
  multiplexor, starting with input number 0, would be: D, 1, 0, 1, ~D,
  ~D, 0, and D.

  9.  Build a decoder with two control inputs, and connect the input
  line as a third input to each of the four AND gates.

  10. Use two OR gates.  The output of one is the low-order bit; it is
  connected to inputs 1 and 3.  The output of the other one, the
  high-order bit has its inputs connected to inputs 2 and 3.  Input 0 is
  not used.

  11. There will be four AND gates, with input fuses blown to generate
      the four minterms, ~ABC, A~BC, AB~C, and ABC.  These four AND
      gates will be connected (through four un-blown fuses) to one OR
      gate, which will generate the output value.
