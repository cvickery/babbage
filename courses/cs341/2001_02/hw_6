Chapter 3

  1.  Choices a, d, and e are all possible.

  2.  Point to one of the roads and ask, "If I were to ask the other
  gang if this is the road to Disneyland, what would they say?"  If the
  answer is no, he should take the road; if the answer is yes, he should
  not take it.  Try constructing a truth table showing all four
  combinations of right/wrong road and liars/truth-tellers.

  3.  With three variables, the truth table has 8 rows, so a function
  can be described by an 8-bit number.  Thus 256 functions exist.  With
  n variables, the truth table has k=2^n rows, and there are 2^k
  functions.

  4.  Here is the truth table:
                 _       _
      P  Q | PQ PQ (PQ)+PQ
      -----|--------------
      0  0 |  0  0     0
      0  1 |  0  0     0
      1  0 |  0  1     1
      1  1 |  1  0     1


  5.  Use one NAND gate to combine the two inputs, then connect the
  output of that gate to both inputs of a second NAND, which will act
  as an inverter, giving the complement of NAND, which is AND.

  6.  By DeMorgan's Law:
  
      __       _
       _   _   _   _
      AB = A + B = A + B
