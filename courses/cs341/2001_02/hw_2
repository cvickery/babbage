Here are the solutions for Homework 2.
Dr. Vickery

  1.  The datapath is 20 nsec long.  The reciprocal of 20 *10^-9 is 
  0.05 * 10^+9, which is 50 * 10^6.  (Always keep the exponent a
  multiple of three.)  That's 50 million instructions per second, or 50
  MIPS.

  2.  The program counter tells where in memory the next instruction is
  to be fetched from.  If it isn't incremented, the computer will fetch
  and execute the same instruction forever.  The only exception would be
  a branch or subroutine call instruction.

  3.  You cannot say anything for sure.  If computer 1 has a
  five-stage pipeline, it can issue up to 500 million
  instructions per second.  If computer 2 is not pipelined,
  it cannot do any better than 200 million instructions per
  second.  Thus, without more information, you cannot say
  which is faster.  And this is assuming that both machines
  have the same instruction set, which is not explicit in
  the question.
  
  6.  A pipeline processor is better.  Array processors are useful only
  if the problem contains inherent parallelism.

  7.  The monastery resembles Figure 2-7 (the ILLIAC-IV
  type), with one master and many slaves.
  
  9.  A pixel requires 6+6+6=18 bits (because log2 of 64 is 6), so a
  single visual frame is 18*10^6 bits.  With 10 frames per second (the
  reciprocal of 100 msec) , the gross data rate is 180 Mb (megabits)
  per second.  However, the brain's processing rate is many orders of
  magnitude slower than this.  As an experiment, try watching the
  random noise on a color television when no station is broadcasting
  and see if you can memorize the color bit pattern for a few minutes.

  13. 268,435,456 is exactly 2^28.  Since addresses are expressed as
  binary numbers, a 28-bit is exactly right for addressing all the bytes
  of this memory.  An easy to remember number like 250,000,000 is not an
  even power of two, so any binary addressing scheme would have to use
  enough bits to access the next power of two above that (i.e.,
  268,435,456), so there would be addresses that wouldn't hold any
  memory, which is not efficient.

  34.  It says: I LOVE YOU.  Note that the period at the end and the
  spaces between the words are all part of the message.
