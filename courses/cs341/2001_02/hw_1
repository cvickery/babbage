Chapter 1 

  1.  A translator converts a program from one language to
  another.  An interpreter carries out a program instruction
  by instruction.  A virtual machine is a conceptiual
  machine; one that does not exist, but which may be
  simulated.

  2.  An interpreter executes a program by fetching the
  first instruction, carrying it out, then fetching the
  next one, and so on.  A translator first converts the
  original program into an equivalent one in another
  language, and then runs the new program.

  5.  You lose a factor of n at each level, so instruction
  execution times at levels 2, 3, and r are k*n, k*n^2, and
  k*n^3, respectively.
  
  12. According to Moore's law, next year the same chip will
  have 1.6 times as many transistors (Figure 1-8).  This
  means that the area of each transistor will have to be
  reduced to 1 / 1.6, or 0.625 the area of this year's
  transistors.  Since the are changes with the square of the
  diameter, the diameter of next year's transistors must be
  0.625^0.5 = 0.79 microns.
