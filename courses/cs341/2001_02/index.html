<H2>Use QC Online</H2>

Course material is available through QC Online this semester.  To
access the material, you will need a "Vanguard" account, which will
give you access to QC Online.  QC Online is a web host which runs course
management software called "Blackboard," so you will hear the terms QC
Online and Blackboard used interchangeably.<p>

To get started, go to [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://vanguard.qc.edu">http://vanguard.qc.edu</A>&nbsp;], where
you can sign up for a student account on the college's Vanguard system.
<B>Note:</B> You will have to use a computer on the Queens College
campus to register for your Vanguard account.  Follow the directions
given there, and you will get a username and password, which can then be
used to access your Vanguard account from anywhere on the Internet.<p>

Once you have your Vanguard account, visit [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://online.qc.edu">http://online.qc.edu</A>&nbsp;], and log in
using the username and password for your Vanguard account.  <I>You must
then click on the "Personal Information" tab and do two critical
things:</I>

<OL>

  <LI>Change your password to a secure one that you can remember
  without writing it down.  It would be both unethical and illegal to
  let anyone else access your account. In fact, you are liable for
  anything someone else does using your account until you notify OIT
  that someone has taken your password, so be sure to keep it as
  secure as you possibly can.

  <LI>Edit your personal information and change your email address from
  "nobody@qc.edu" to the real email address where you want me to send
  supplementary course material during the semester.  If you change
  your email account during the term, be sure to update it on QC
  Online.

</OL>

You will not have access to critial material for this course if you do
not set up your QC Online account properly.  Once you have it set up,
you should see CS-341 in the list of courses for which you are
registered.  Go there to start accessing the information.<p>
