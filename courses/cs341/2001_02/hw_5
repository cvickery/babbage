  9.  A pixel requires 6+6+6=18 bits (because log2 of 64 is 6), so a
  single visual frame is 18*10^6 bits.  With 10 frames per second (the
  reciprocal of 100 msec) , the gross data rate is 180 Mb (megabits)
  per second.  However, the brain's processing rate is many orders of
  magnitude slower than this.  As an experiment, try watching the
  random noise on a color television when no station is broadcasting
  and see if you can memorize the color bit pattern for a few minutes.

  10. There are 4 nucleotides, so it takes 2 bits to determine which one
  occurs at any one place.  There are 3 * 10^9 nucleotides in a DNA
  molecule, so there are 2 * 3 * 10^9 bits of information, about 6
  gigabits.  Divide that by 100,000 to get 60,000 bits per gene.

  14. From 0 to 9 the codes are 0000000 1101001 0101010 1000011 1001100
  0100101 1100110 0001111 1110000 0011001.  Using the algorithm given in
  the book, the bits would be numbered:
  
      P1 P2 D3 P4 D2 D1 D0
      C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7
  
  P1, P2,  and P4 are parity bits, while D3 through D0 are data bits.
  C1 through C7 are the corresponding codeword bit names.  P1 is the
  exclusive or of D3, D2, and D0 because those codeword positions (3, 5,
  and 7) all have a the bit with value 1 set in their binary
  representations.  P2 is the exclusive or of D3, D1, and D0 because 3,
  6, and 7 all have the bit with a value of 2 set in their binary
  representations.  P4 is the exclusive or of D2, D1, and D0 because 5,
  6, and 7 all have a 4 in their binary representations.

  16. We'll assume that parity bits occupy positions 0, 1,
  2, 4, and 8, etc.  This means that our codewords will have
  lengths of 2^n instead of 2^n -1. (The book omits the
  parity bit in position 0, which accounts for the
  difference.)  This affects the results very little.

      5   32         27                15.6%

      7   128        121                5.5%
      8   256        248                3.1%
      9   512        503                1.8%
      10  1024       1014             > 1.0%

  The point is that the overhead becomes insignificant for
  large codewords, making Hamming Codes especially good for
  situations where there are lots of data bits and only
  single or double-bit errors are likely to occur.

  26.  Each frame contains 345,600 pixels, or 1,036,800 bytes of
  information.  At 30 frames per second, the rate per second is
  31,104,000 bytes/sec.  In 133 minutes this amounts to
  2.482*10^11 bytes.  The disk capacity is 3.5*2^30 which is about
  3.758*10^9 bytes.  We are off by a factor of 66, so the compression
  has to be 66X.

  28.  The electron beams must visit 1024x768x75 pixel positions per
  second. This is a total of 58,060,800 pixels.  The reciprocal of this
  is 0.0000000172, which is 17.2 nsec per pixel.

  31.  Each ASCII code requires 7 bits.  Add one bit for
  parity, making 8, plus one start bit and one stop bit
  because it is asynchronous transmission, and a total of 10
  bits have to be transmitted per character.  The speed of
  the modem is irrelevant; the point is that only 7 of each
  ten bits transmitted actually contain data, so the answer
  is 70%.
