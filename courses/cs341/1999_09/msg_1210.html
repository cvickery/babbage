<H1>End of Term Information</H1>

<OL>

<LI>  I updated the web page for [&nbsp;<a HREF="Homework_7.html">Homework
7</A>&nbsp;] to include a copy of
the diagram for the extra question; basically what we did
in class on December 10.

<LI>  I don't have a real study guide for the final ready yet,
but I wanted to tell you the following things about the
exam:
<UL>
  <LI> It will be cumulative.  About half the exam will be on
  material covered before the last exam, and half will be on
  new material.
  <LI> Contrary to what I said in class today, I expect you to
  read through the end of Chapter 4.  But only a small
  percentage of the exam (less than 10%) will be on material
  that I did not have time to cover in class.
  <LI> I am planning to have about 60 multiple choice
  questions on the exam.
</UL>
<LI>  I plan to have the final exam count 40% of your course
average and the other two exams will count 30% each.  If
your grade on one of the exams is 10 points below your
average for the other two, then I will reduce the low exam's
weight by 10% and add 5% to each of the other two.
Translation from your course average to your letter grade in
the course is a mechanical process that I do according to
the college's policy about this.  But if you handed in
homeworks regularly and need just a few tenths of a point to
move to a higher grade, I'll do that this term.
