<B>Assignment:</B><p>

This assignment is due <B>May 1, 1998</B>.<p>

Draw the gates to implement a clocked D latch and to implement a
clocked D flip-flop (master-slave).<p>

Construct timing diagrams for both the latch and the flip-flop to
illustrate their behavior.  You are to make up a "interesting"
sequences of inputs and show the resulting outputs.  Be sure to
illustrate how the two differ in their timing with respect to the
clock, show how to turn them on and off, and anything else you think
would be interesting.<p>
