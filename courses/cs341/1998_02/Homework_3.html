<H3><B>Remember</B>, homeworks are graded, so you must do your own
work.  If you do not follow this policy, you will be given a failing
grade in the course, and risk college disciplinary action.</H3>

<B>Assignment:</B> Exercises 3.1 through 3.6<p>
Write your answers out on paper, and hand it in on the due date.<p>
<B>Recommended:</B> Fix Exercise 3.6 and run the code on the MIPS
simulator.  You will need to add a label, main, to the beginning and
to terminate the program with a <I>syscall</I>.  Here is a sample
program that illustrates comments, directives for data, and using
<I>syscall</I>.  For more details, see Appendix A of the book.

<PRE>

      #  Program to add two numbers

            .data       # Begin Data Segment
      num1: .word 123
      num2: .word 321

            .text       # Begin Code Segment
      main:
            lw  $t0, num1
            lw  $t1, num2
            add $s1, $t0, $t1

            li  $v0, 10 # "Exit" code for syscall
            syscall
            .end
