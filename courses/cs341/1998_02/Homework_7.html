<B>Assignment:</B><p>

This assignment is due <B>April 3, 1998</B>.<p>

Program the data sheet for a [ <a href="../pal16h8.html">PAL16H8</a>
] to implement a four-bit parallel adder.  I know,  the web page version
is useless.  I'll hand out legible copies in Tuesday's class.<p>

Assign all inputs and outputs to pins on the diagram, but you only
have to program two full-adders and show how they are connected.
