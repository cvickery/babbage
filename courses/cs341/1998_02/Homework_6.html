<B>Assignment:</B><p>

In the March 20 class, I started an exercise, which you are to
complete.<p>

Given this truth table (for which I gave the equivalent logic network
in class):<p>
<pre>
          a b c | Y
         -------+---
          0 0 0 | 0
          0 0 1 | 1
          0 1 0 | 1
          0 1 1 | 0
          1 0 0 | 1
          1 0 1 | 1
          1 1 0 | 1
          1 1 1 | 1
</pre>
<ol>

  <li>  Minimize the equivalent boolean equation using the technique
        shown in class (using the rule that says that a variable OR its
        complement equals 1).

  <li>  Convert the truth table to a Karnaugh Map, and minimize the
        Karnaugh Map.  Be sure this answer agrees with your first one.

  <li>  Draw the logic network (gates) that implements the minimized 
        form of the function.

</ol>
