<h2>Assignment 6</h2>

  Exercises <b>A.10</b> (<i>hint</i>: xor gives 1 if two bits are
  different), <b>A.13</b> (but use a 16 x 1 MUX and compute the
  majority function for five variables), <b>A.14</b>, <b>A.15</b>,
  <b>A.16</b>, <b>A.17</b>, <b>A.19</b> (but use a 4 x 1 MUX instead of
  a 16 x 1.  As orignally asked, the question wanted you to figure
  out that the fourth selector input would be tied to ground so the
  bottom 8 inputs become "don't cares."  Alternatively, you could have
  done it by putting the same sequence of zeros and ones into the
  bottom 8 inputs as you would put in the top 8, making the fourth
  selector a don't care.), <b>A.21</b>, <b>A.22</b>.
