<h2>Serial Multiplier Design</h2>
</center>
  Complete the design for the serial multiplier started in class on
  November 6.  The following paragraphs describe the design which is
  based on the multiplier shown in the text on pages 69-71.<p>
  
  There are two parts to the multiplier, the <i>datapath</i> and the
  <i>controller</i>.  The datapath consists of the registers <i>m, q,
  c,</i> and <i>a</i> plus the parallel adder.  The controller is a
  finite state machine that generates the signals to cause the datapath
  to perform the proper sequence of operations.<p>
  
  The multiplier There is one external input signal, called
 <i>start</i>, and an external output signal called <i>wait</i>.  In
 class I named <i>wait</i> with a bar over it to indicate that it is
 "active low."  That is, when it is zero it indicates that the rest of
 the datapath should wait for the multiplication to complete.  In this
 web page I'm leaving the bar out (because no way to draw one in
 html.)<p>

  As in the normal ALU design, there are also 4-bit external data inputs
  named A and B that, for multiplication, supply the multiplicand and
  multiplier respectively.  The <i>a</i> and <i>q</i> registers serve
  as external data outputs for the product.<p>

  Internally, there are four control signals: <i>initialize</i>,
  <i>add</i>, <i>shift</i>, and the value of <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>.  The
  first three are used to control the datapath of the multiplier, and
  the last one helps determine the state transitions of the
  controller.<p>

  <table align=center border=1 width=80%>

  <tr>
    <th>Control Signal
    <th>Datapath/Controller Operation
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center width=20%><i>initialize</i>
    <td>Load register <i>m</i> from the A inputs, load register <i>q</i>
    from the B inputs, and clear registers <i>c</i> (the single
    flip-flop that captures the carry out of the adder) and <i>a</i>.
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center width=20%><i>add</i>
    <td>Register <i>a</i> gets the sum of itself and register <i>m</i>.
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center width=20%><i>shift</i>
    <td>Shift registers <i>c</i>, <i>a</i>, and <i>q</i> (treated as a
    single 9-bit unit) to the right one place.  This can be either an
    arithmetic or logical shift (or even a circular shift) because the
    value of <i>c</i> will be overwritten by the result of adding in the
    following state.
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center width=20%><i>q<sub>0</sub></i>
    <td>Used to control whether to add or shift in the next state.

  </table>

<h2>Datapath Design</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Design a four-bit parallel adder suitable for use in this
  multiplier. Note that it does not have logic for subtraction or
  anything else.  Show how it connects to the <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, and
  <i>m</i> registers.

  <li>Design register <i>m</i> which is loaded from the A inputs when
  <i>initialize</i> is 1, and is unaffected by clock pulses otherwise.

  <li>Design register <i>a</i>, which is set to all zeros when
  <i>initialize</i> is 1, shifts right one place (as part of
  <i>c-a-q</i>) when <i>shift</i> is 1, which is loaded with the
  outputs of the adder when <i>add</i> is 1,and which is unchanged
  otherwise.

  <li>Design register <i>q</i>, which is loaded from the B inputs when
  <i>initialize</i> is 1, which shifts right one place (as part of
  <i>c-a-q</i>) when <i>shift</i> is 1, and which is unchanged
  otherwise.

  <li>Design the one-bit register <i>c</i>, which is set to zero when
  <i>initialize</i> is 1, which is set to 0 when </i>initialize is 1,
  shifts into <i>a<sub>3</sub></i> when <i>shift</i> is one, is loaded from
  the C<sub>4</sub> output of the adder when <i>add</i> is 1, and is
  unchanged otherwise.

</ul>

  Here is a shortcut that can make design of the datapath easier. 
  There are three variables that control the datapath,
  <i>initialize</i>, <i>add</i>, and <i>shift</i>, suggesting that
  there are eight combinations of inputs to consider.  But the three
  control signals are mutually exclusive: no more than one will ever be
  true at a time.  (You have to understand the operation of the
  multiplier, as described in the text, to see this.)  So the design of
  the datapath can be simplified by generating two intermediate control
  signals, which I'll call <i>x<sub>1</sub></i> and
  <i>x<sub>0</sub></i>, as follows:<p>

  <table align=center border=1 cellpadding=5>
  <tr>
    <th>init&nbsp;&nbsp;add&nbsp;&nbsp;shift
    <th>x<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;x<sub>0</sub>
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center>0&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;0
    <td align=center>0&nbsp;&nbsp;0
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center>0&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;1
    <td align=center>0&nbsp;&nbsp;1
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center>0&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;0
    <td align=center>1&nbsp;&nbsp;0
    
  <tr>
    <td align=center>1&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;0
    <td align=center>1&nbsp;&nbsp;1
  </table><p>

  You can use these two signals to control all the multiplexors for all
  the flip-flops in all the registers.  You just have to connect the
  correct source of data for each input of each multiplexor.<p>

<h2>Controller Design</h2>

  The purpose of the controller is to generate the values for the
  control inputs to the datapath, <i>initialize, add,</i> and
  <i>shift</i>, plus the external output, <i>wait.</i><p>

  I suggest you start implementing the control section with a 4-bit
  state register named <i>s</i>.  Connect the outputs of <i>s</i> to a
  decoder with outputs named <i>state<sub>0</sub></i>,
  <i>state<sub>1</sub></i>, ... <i>state<sub>15</sub></i>.  (The outputs
  numbered 9-15 won't be connected to anything because you need only 9
  states.)  The remainder of the control section design is to show how
  to produce the D inputs for each of the bits of <i>s</i> (the "next
  state"), as well as the internal inputs, <i>initialize</i>,
  <i>shift</i>, and <i>add</i>.  (You don't have to do anything about
  <i>q<sub>0</sub></i> because it is just the Q output of the rightmost
  flip-flop of register <i>q</i>.)<p>

  With all the forgoing material in mind, the behavior of the controller
  can be described as follows:<p>

  <table align=center border=1 width=80%>

    <tr>
      <th width=20%>State
      <th>Description

    <tr>
      <td align=center>0
      <td>The controller remains in this state, with <i>wait</i> equal
      to 1 ("deasserted") for as long as <i>start</i> is 0.  When start
      becomes 1, <i>wait</i> immediately goes to 0, <i>initialize</i>
      goes to 1, and on the next clock pulse, the controller goes into
      either state 1 or state 2, depending on the value of
      <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>1
      <td>During this state, the <i>add</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into state 2.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>2
      <td>During this state, the <i>shift</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into either state 3 or state
      4, depending on the value of <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>3
      <td>During this state, the <i>add</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into state 4.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>4
      <td>During this state, the <i>shift</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into either state 5 or state
      6, depending on the value of <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>5
      <td>During this state, the <i>add</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into state 6.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>6
      <td>During this state, the <i>shift</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into either state 7 or state
      8, depending on the value of <i>q<sub>0</sub></i>.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>7
      <td>During this state, the <i>add</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into state 8.

    <tr>
      <td align=center>8
      <td>During this state, the <i>shift</i> signal should be 1.  The
      next clock pulse puts the controller into state 0.

  </table><p>

Create a state table based on the above description, use it to
derive the logic equations for <i>wait</i>, <i>initialize</i>,
<i>shift</i>, <i>add</i>, and the D inputs for each bit of state
register <i>s</i>.  Then complete your design by implementing these
functions in your diagram for the entire multiplier.<p>

Note that <i>add</i> and <i>shift</i> follow the Moore state machine
model in that their values depend only on the state of the controller. 
But <i>initialize</i> and <i>wait</i> follow the Mealy model in that
their values depend both on the state of the controller and the values
of external inputs.  What would have been the effect of implementing the
controller as a pure Moore machine? (Answer: One more state would have
been needed, an overhead of anywhere from 12.5 to 20% added to the time
required to complete a multiply operation.)<p>

You do not have to draw a state diagram because the controller described
mixes Mealy and Moore behavior, making a state diagram difficult to
draw in a consistent fashion for all states and arcs.  (Challenge:
can you do it anyway?)<p>
