<H1>Audio Sampling Exercise</H1>
</center>
<H2>Introduction</H2>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to give you some practice with the
variables involved in storing physical-world stimuli as digital
information.  These variables include <I>transducers</I>,
<I>analog/digital and digital/analog conversion</I>, <I>quantization</I>, and
<I>encoding</I>.</P>

<DL>
    <DT>Transducer

    <DD>A device that converts energy from one form to another.  For
    example, a microphone is a transducer that converts sound waves in
    the air into voltages that are proportional to the sound pressure
    level of the sound waves.  The voltage that comes from a microphone
    is called an <I>analog signal</I> because its level continuously
    varies as a direct analog to the intensity of the sound pressure
    level strking the microphone.<p>

    Similarly, a loudspeaker or earphone is a transducer that converts
    analog voltages into sound waves.<p>

    <DT>Analog to Digital (A/D) Converter

    <DD>An electronic device that converts continuously varying
    voltages on a wire (such as the output of a microphone) into binary
    numbers.<p> <center><IMG src="AD_CONV.gif" alt="A/D
    Converter"></center> (This diagram comes from <A
    href="http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/">The
    Techweb Encyclopedia</A>.)<p>

    The exact format of the binary information that comes out of an a/d
    converter differs from device to device.  For now, think as the a/d
    converter as a black box with one wire that brings the analog
    voltage into it and with <I>n</I> wires coming out of it, which
    continuously carry voltages representing binary ones and zeros. 
    The converter discriminates among 2<sup><I>n</I></sup> voltage
    levels on the input wires, and always outputs the appropriate
    <I>n</I>-bit number representing the present input voltage.<p>

    <I>For Example:</I> Assume an A/D converter is designed to handle
    analog voltages that vary between -1.0 and +1.0 volts and that
    it has two wires for the binary outputs.  This means that it would
    differentiate among four different input voltage levels as
    follows:<p>

    <CENTER><TABLE CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1>
    <TH>Analog voltage in
    <TH>Binary number out
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">-1.0 to -0.5
      <TD ALIGN="center">0&nbsp;0
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">-0.5 to 0.0
      <TD ALIGN="center">0&nbsp;1
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">0.0 to +0.5
      <TD ALIGN="center">1&nbsp;0
    <TR>
      <TD ALIGN="right">+0.5 to +1.0
      <TD ALIGN="center">1&nbsp;1
    </TABLE></CENTER><p>

    Although both the input and outputs of an A/D converter are
    electrical voltages, the input voltage varies continuously in time,
    whereas the voltages of the output wires always have just one of
    two different values, one of which represents a binary zero and the
    other of which represents a binary one.<p>

    <DT>D/A Converter
    <DD>A digital to analog converter, as its name implies, converts
    binary numbers into analog voltages that are proportional to the
    magnitude of the binary number at its input.  Note that a D/A
    converter doesn't generate a continuously varying voltage; it
    generates one of 2<sup><I>n</I></sup> voltages, depending on the
    value of the <I>n</I>-bit binary number input to it.

    In this diagram, the waveform on the right is only a crude
    approximation of the original analog signal, on the left.  This
    exercise deals with the parameters that affect how well the waveform
    coming out of the D/A converter approximates the one going into the
    A/D converter.<p>

    <DT>Quantization
    
    <DD>The term quanization refers to the use of discrete values to
    represent continuous variables.  In this exercise, the two
    variables are the two axes of an analog sound wave. The X axis is
    time, and the Y axis is voltage.  Both of these axes must be
    divided into discrete values in order to store the analog signal in
    digital form.<p>

    The time axis is divided by a process called <I>sampling</I>: The
    output of the A/D converter is recorded at periodic intervals.  The
    time between samples is called the sampling interval, and its
    reciprocal (the number of samples per second) is called the
    sampling frequency or rate.  The higher the sampling rate, the
    finer-grained the quantization, and the more accurately temporal
    changes in the input signal can be recorded.<p>

    The granularity of the voltage axis depends on the number of bits
    that the A/D converter uses to encode voltages.  In the example
    given above, the A/D converter had two output wires, giving
    2<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;4 voltage ranges for the quantization
    granularity.  The more bits output by the A/D converter, the
    smaller the quantization granularity, and the more accurately the
    signal's intensity can be approximated.<p>

    <DT>Encoding
    
    <DD>In the case we are considering, encoding refers to how binary
    numbers are assigned to analog voltage ranges, a process performed
    by the A/D converter.  Assume that the total possible range of input
    voltages is divided into 2<sup><I>n</I></sup> equal-sized intervals,
    and assume that the lowest interval maps to a value of zero, the
    highest interval maps to the value 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1, and
    that intermediate intervals map to corresponding intermediate
    values.  The table above is an example of this type of encoding.

<H2>The Exercise</H2>

Assume that the input signal is a 1 KHz sine wave with a peak-to-peak
amplitude of 2.0 volts.  That is, the minimum voltage is -1.0
volts and the maximum voltage is +1.0 volts.  Construct tables like the
one given at the beginning of this page for the following combinations
of sampling rate and bits per sample:<p>

<CENTER><TABLE CELLPADDING=5 BORDER=1>
<TR>
    <TH>Sampling Rate
    <TH>Bits per Sample

<TR>
    <TD ALIGN="right">4 KHz
    <TD ALIGN="center">2

<TR>
    <TD ALIGN="right">4 KHz
    <TD ALIGN="center">4

    <TD ALIGN="right">4 KHz
    <TD ALIGN="center">8

<TR>
    <TD ALIGN="right">8 KHz
    <TD ALIGN="center">4

<TR>
    <TD ALIGN="right">16 KHz
    <TD ALIGN="center">8

</TABLE></CENTER><p>

Construct the table for one complete cycle of the sine wave. You can
write a program or a spreadsheet to generate the tables, if you
like.<p>

Draw a diagram showing the encoded waveform (like the right side of the
diagram above) for each row of the table.  Be sure to label both the X
and Y axes to show the scale for each graph.  You may generate these
diagrams by hand on graph paper, using a spreadsheet, or by writing a
Java program to draw the graphs.<p>
