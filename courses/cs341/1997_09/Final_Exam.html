<OL TYPE="a">

<LI>How many bits are there in each &quot;word&quot; of the memory system?  (<I>Hint: What is the ‘B’ in &quot;MB&quot;?)</LI>

<LI>How many bits of memory are there in the entire memory system?  Express your answer as a power of two, and show how you computed it.</LI>
<LI>How many bits of memory are there in each RAM IC?  Express your answer as a power of two, and show how your computed it.</LI>
<LI>How many RAM ICs will have to be combined to build the entire memory system.</LI>
<LI>How many address wires will go to the entire memory system?</LI>
<LI>How many address wires will go to each RAM IC?</LI>
<LI>How many rows of RAM ICs will be used to construct the memory system,?</LI>
<LI>How does this number of rows relate to your answers to parts  <I>f</I>  and  <I>g</I>  of this question?</LI>
<LI>Draw a block diagram (no gates) showing the structure of the decoder that would be used to implement this memory system.  Label all inputs and outputs to show where they would come from and where they would go to.</LI></OL>

<P>2.&#9;Assume that register 5 contains 0x12345678 when an instruction, &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier New">lw&nbsp;5,0xFFF6(5)</FONT>&quot; is executed.</P></DIR>

<LI>The operation code is 35<SUB>10</SUB>.  Translate this instruction into hexadecimal.  Show all work.</LI>
<LI>What would be the address of the word of memory loaded by this instruction.  Show all work.</LI></OL>

<P>3.&#9;Assume that registers PC, 5, and 6 contain the values 0x00040000, 100<SUB>10</SUB>, and 0x00000064 when an instruction, &quot;<FONT FACE="Courier New">beq&nbsp;5,6,0xFFF6</FONT>&quot; us executed.</P></DIR>

<LI>Draw the gate(s) to generate the value of the line labeled &quot;Branch.&quot;  Be sure to show where the inputs come from.</LI>
<LI>Explain the purpose of the AND gate in the diagram.  Tell <I>why</I> it is there, not just what its inputs and output are connected to.</LI></OL>
