<P>
1. Draw the gates to implement a multiplexor with three control
(selector) inputs.  Be sure to label all inputs and output(s)
meaningfully.
<P>
2. Draw a diagram that shows the design of position zero in the
32-bit MIPS ALU that was developed in Chapter 4 of the text. 
Be sure to label all inputs and outputs meaningfully.  Assume
there is no carry-lookahead logic.
<P>
3. Three of the inputs in your answer to Question 2 are used to
determine the operation the ALU performs.  List all eight combinations
of values for these three inputs, and tell what operation the
ALU performs for each one.
<P>
4. Give the binary or hexadecimal values of <I>all</I> the inputs
and outputs of the MIPS ALU when it adds -5 and +5.  Give  the
control inputs and condition code outputs in binary.  <I>G</I>ive
the operands and result in hexadecimal.  <I>Hints:</I> (1) The
second operand is 0x00000005.  (2) The result is zero.
<P>
5. (A) What do the terms &quot;carry generate&quot; and &quot;carry
propagate&quot; mean?<BR>
(B) Draw the gates to determine the values of carry generate and
carry propagate for position <I>i</I> of a carry-lookahead unit.
<BR>
(C) Give the formula for the C<SUB>2</SUB> output of a carry-lookahead
unit.<BR>
(D) What does carry-lookahead logic accomplish compared to a ripple
carry design?
<P>
6. (A) Draw the gates to implement an unclocked latch, a clocked
D latch, and a D flip-flop.  Label all inputs and outputs carefully.
<BR>
(B) What is the difference in the behavior of a clocked D latch
compared to a D flop-flop?
<P>
7. Draw bit<I><SUB>i</SUB></I> of Register<I><SUB>j</SUB></I>
of the MIPS register file, and show how it connects to the output
multiplexors of the register file.  Indicate the structure of
the multiplexors clearly (how many inputs, how many of them there
are, etc.), but don't draw any gates.
<P>
8. (A) Explain the problem that tristate gates solve and tell
how the &quot;third state&quot; solves it.<BR>
(B) Why are decoders often used in conjunction with tristate gates?
