<H1 align=center>Study Guide for Final Exam</H1>
The final exam will be Monday, December 22 from 1:45 to 3:45 in PH-276.<p>
Here is a list of topics to study for the exam.  You will find
information on each topic in either your text (Chapter 5 and Appendix
B), your class notes, or both.<p>
<ul>

  <li>RAM design.  (Be sure to check [<a href="../memory_system">my
  supplement</a>]) -- this was not fully tested on the second exam.

  <li>Review the instructions implemented in the Chapter 5 CPUs: lw/sw,
  R-type, beq, and j.  Be sure you know exactly how the effective
  address is calculated for lw/sw, beq, and j.

  <li>Single clock per instruction datapath and timing.

  <li>Control signals for the single clock per instruction design.

  <li>How to generate the control signals for the single clock per
  instruction design for each type of instruction.  How to decode the
  fields of the instructions.

  <li>Rationale for the multiple clock per instruction design.

  <li>Tradeoffs in going to the multiple clock per instruction design:
  reduced number of hardware units; increased complexity of the control;
  speed advantage.
  
  <li>State diagram for control of the multiple clock per instruction
  design.

</ul>

If you think of something I covered in class that's not on this list,
let me know and I'll add it to the list!<p>
