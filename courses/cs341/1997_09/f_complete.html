<H2 ALIGN=Center>NAND, NOR, and MPX are Functionally Complete</H2>

The assignment was to prove that two-input NAND, NOR, and MPX are
"functionally complete" by implementing AND, OR, and NOT using only the
gates specified. (Actually, a multiplexor isn't a gate, but the idea is
the same.)  They are called functionally <I>complete</I> because we know
we can implement <I>any</I> logic function using AND, OR, and NOT to
build a sum-of-products solution.
