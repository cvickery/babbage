The second exam will be Friday, November 21.<p>
Here is a list of topics to study for the exam.  You will find
information on each topic in either your text (Chapter 4 and Appendix
B), your class notes, or both.<p>
<ul>
  <li>Representing negative numbers: two's complement, one's complement,
  sign-magnitude, biased.
  <li>Addition and subtraction of two's complement numbers, including
  carry and overflow detection logic.
  <li>Construction of a 32-bit ALU for MIPS.
  <li>Carry Lookahead Logic.
  <li>Speed comparison of ALU with and without carry lookahead
  (propagation delays).
  <li>Gates, truth tables, and logic equations.
  <li>Algebraic and Karnaugh Map minimization.
  <li>Multiplexers, decoders, programmable logic devices (PLA, PAL,
  PROM).
  <li>RAM design.  (Be sure to check [<a href="../memory_system">my
  supplement</a>].)
</ul>

If you think of something I covered in class that's not on this list,
let me know and I'll add it to the list!<p>
