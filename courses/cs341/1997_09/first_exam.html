<H1 align=center>First Exam, Fall 1997</H1>
<P>
1. A computer executes a program that consists of 75% integer
instructions, 10% floating-point instructions, and 15% string
instructions.  The integer instructions all require 1 clock to
execute, the floating-point instructions require an average of
2.0 clocks to execute, and the string instructions require an
average of 4.0 clocks to execute.  The processor uses a 125 MHz
clock.
<OL>
<LI>How long is the clock period, in nanoseconds.
<LI>What is the average number of clocks per instruction for the
entire program.
<LI>How long would it take to run the program (in seconds) if
it has to execute a total of a billion instructions.
<LI>If there were a way to make the string instructions execute
in an average of 2.0 clocks instead of 4.0, what would the total
execution time be for the same program, in seconds.
<LI>What speedup does your answer to (1D) represent.
</OL>
<P>
2. 
<OL>
<LI>Tell the name and number of bits for each field of a MIPS
  <I>lw</I> instruction.
<LI>Tell how the MIPS CPU uses the contents of these fields to
compute the address of the memory word to be loaded.
<LI>You should have mentioned all but two of the fields in your
answer to (2B); Tell how the CPU uses these other two fields when
it processes a  <I>lw</I> instruction.
</OL>
<P>
3. 
<OL>
<LI>Tell the name and number of bits for each field of a MIPS
  <I>beq</I> instruction.
<LI>Tell how the MIPS CPU uses the contents of these fields to
compute the address of the next instruction to execute if the
branch succeeds.
<LI>Tell how the MIPS CPU determines the address of the next instruction
to execute if the branch fails.
</OL>
<P>
4. In a MIPS CPU, assume register 18 contains 0x7FFFFFFF and register
19 contains 0x80000000:
<OL>
<LI>Which register contains the numerically larger two's complement
value.
<LI>What will be the contents of register 17 after this instruction
is executed (answer in hexadecimal):<BR>
     <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">slt $17, $18, $19</FONT></TT>
<LI>Translate that instruction into hexadecimal.  Show all work.
<LI>What will be the contents of register 17 after this instruction
is executed (answer in both hexadecimal and decimal):<BR>
     <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">add $17, $18, $19</FONT></TT>
<LI>Tell the value of the carry out of the leftmost position when
the <TT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Courier New">add</FONT></TT> instruction
in (4D) is executed, and whether or not overflow occurs.
</OL>
<P>
5. Encode -7.6875 as an IEEE-754 single precision number.  Answer
in hexadecimal, and show all work.
