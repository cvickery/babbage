<H2>Introduction</H2>

The exam will cover material in sections 3.4 through 4.3 of the
textbook.  <I>But the emphasis will very much be on the material
covered in class rather than all the material in those sections of the
book.</I><p>

One way you should be prepare for the exam is to be sure you can answer
all the homework questions that have been assigned, including the
"virtual homework" (Exercises 1-5 from chapter 4) for which I emailed
out solutions.  What follows are some more sample questions, with
solutions.

<H2>Sample Questions</H2>

Assume you will be given copies of Figures 4-5 and 4-11 to use in
answering these questions.

<DL>

  <DT>What will be the address of the microinstruction with the label
  <I>iadd1</I>?

  <DD>0x60.  The operation code of the iadd instruction is 0x60 (from
  Figure 4-11), so that's the address of the first microinstruction in
  the sequence of microinstructions that will interpret iadd
  instructions.  The "1" at the end of "iadd1" tells you that this is
  the first microinstruction that will be executed for iadd
  instructions.<p>

  <DT>What will be the address of the microinstruction with the label
  <I>iadd2</I>?

  <DD>We don't know.  Although it's logically the next microinstruction
  after <I>iadd1</I> (the "2" at the end of "iadd2" tells you that), it
  could be at any location in control memory.  The answer 0x61 would be
  <I>wrong</I> because that is just one of many possible addresses
  that might be used.<p>

  <DT>Assume that <I>iadd2</I> is at control memory address 0x6E,
  translate the microinstruction at 0x60 into binary.
  <DD>001101110 000 00 11 0110 000001001 010 0100

  <BR>This question assumes you know that 0x60 is the address of the
  microinstruction at iadd1 (see above).  You would somehow have to be
  given the code for that microinstruction:
  "mar&nbsp;=&nbsp;sp&nbsp;=&nbsp;sp&nbsp;-&nbsp;1;&nbsp;rd".  The
  question tests whether you know that this microinstruction contains
  the address of iadd2 (0x6E) in its next_address field and can
  translate that hexadecimal value into binary.  Then it tests your
  ability to fill in the binary fields.  The first nine bits are 0x6E
  as a 9-bit binary number (001101110); the next three bits are 000
  because none of the jump options is being used; the next two bits are
  00 because no shifting is specified; the next two bits are 11 because
  you have to add to compute sp&nbsp;-&nbsp;1; the next four bits are
  0110 to disable A, enable B, invert a, and not increment so that you
  add sp to all 1's (negative 1 in two's complement); the next nine
  bits are 000001001 so the result will be loaded into both sp and mar;
  the next three bits are 010 to start the read ("rd") operation; and
  the last four bits are 0100 to select sp for the B bus.<p>

  <DT>Assume iload3 is at control memory address 0x28, translate this
  microinstruction into binary:
  "mar&nbsp;=&nbsp;h&nbsp;+&nbsp;cpp;rd;goto&nbsp;iload3
  <DD>000101000 000 00 11 1100 000000001 010 0110
  <BR>The next address field is 0x28 in binary (000101000); the jam
  bits are not set (00); the alu computes a+b (11 1100), the mar is
  the destination (000000001); there is a read operation (010); the cpp
  register goes to the b bus (0110).<p>

  <DT>Write a sequence of microinstructions that will interchange the
  values of the top two words of the stack.  <I>Note:</I>  In class I
  think I said that the stack grows downward in memory, but that's not
  true in IJVM, where you add 1 to the stack pointer when you push
  something onto the stack.

  <DD><code>mar = sp - 1; rd</CODE> //  Read second word from stack
  <BR><CODE>mar = sp</CODE> //  Make mar point to top of stack
  <BR><CODE>h = mdr; wr</CODE> //  Write second word to top of stack in memory
  <BR><CODE>mdr = tos</CODE> //  Prepare to write old top of stack value
  <BR><CODE>mar = sp - 1; wr</CODE> // Write old top of stack to second word
  <BR><CODE>tos = h</CODE> // Save new top of stack value in tos
  register.

  <BR>The tos register always has a copy of the top word of the stack
  in memory, which is why the last instruction is needed.  Note that
  the value of sp never changes in this sequence, even though two
  different words of memory are accessed using sp as the starting
  address.<p>

  <DT>Draw a diagram that shows how bit <I>i</I> of the sp register
  connects to the B and C busses.  Be sure to show where all control
  signals involved come from and where else they go.
  
  <DD>The idea is for you to show that output number 4 of the 4 x 16
  decoder in Figure 4-6 is used to enable a tristate buffer connecting
  the output of SP<SUB>i</SUB> to wire <I>i</I> of the B Bus and that
  this control wire also enables the other tristate buffers connecting
  the other 31 bits of SP to their corresponding wires of the B Bus. 
  In addition, you need to show that one of the nine wires in the C
  field of the microinstruction register (MIR) is used to enable the
  clock input to SP<SUB>i</SUB> by being ANDed with the clock; the
  output of this AND gate also goes to the clock inputs of the other 31
  flip-flops in SP.  (Alternatively, the control wire could go to 31
  other AND gates, but this would be wasteful.  Another alternative,
  mentioned briefly in class, would be to have a 2x1 multiplexor for each
  bit of SP which causes the bit to be loaded either from the output of
  the flip-flop or from the corresponding wire of the C bus.)
  <BR>The only gates you would draw for this question would be the
  tristate buffers and the AND gate(s) between the C bus and the SP
  bit; the flip-flop and decoder should be drawn as boxes.<p>

  <DT>What is the bandwidth of a 32-bit bus operating with a 100 MHz
  clock?
  <DD>3.2 Gbits per second.<p>
  
  <DT>Question 42 on page 202.
  <DD>Instead of responding to addresses with bit patterns that look
  like 11xxxxxxxxxxxxxx, the pio would respond only to addresses that
  look like 111xxxxxxxxx.  This means that addresses that look like
  110xxxxxxxxx will not be responded to by the pio, ram, or eprom.<p>

  <DT>What is the purpose of a device controller, such as a pio or uart?

  <DD>The status, control, and buffer registers in the device
  controller provide a mechanism for presenting a standard memory-like
  interface to the CPU bus, while providing device-specific signals to
  the actual device unit to be attached to the computer.  The cpu can
  write data in one bus cycle to the device controller and then do
  other processing while the device controller manages the actual
  transfer to the device. Important concepts are: (1) The addressing of
  the registers on the device controller just like addressing memory
  words (2) The memory-like speed of transfers between the cpu the
  device controller compared to the relatively slow transfers of
  information between the device controller and the i/o device, and (3)
  The use of interrupts by device controllers to tell the cpu when it
  has completed an i/o operation.
