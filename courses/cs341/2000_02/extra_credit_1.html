<H1>Extra Credit Assignment</H1>
</center>

<H2>Overview</H2>

You can add up to 10 points to your course average by writing a paper on
the topic of "Overclocking."  Your paper will be graded on a ten-point
scale.  However many points you earn, that number will be added to your
course average.  So even if you "fail miserably," you can add 1-2 points
to your average.

<H2>Grading Criteria</H2>

<B>All</B> of the following criteria will be used to determine your grade for
the assignment:

<UL>
  <LI>Technical accuracy and thoroughness.
  <LI>Organization and clarity of writing.
  <LI>English usage (grammar, spelling, and punctuation).
  <LI>Neatness!
</UL>

In addition, you must cite <U>all</U> the sources of information you
used to gather the information you used to write your paper.  Your
sources may be books, articles, web pages, manuals, or any other
published source of information you can find.  You will get no credit
if you fail to cite all your sources in a form that allows the reader
to access them.  That means you have to give publication information
for each source.  Publication information may be:

<UL>
  <LI>The author (if known), title, and URL of a Web page.
  <LI>The author and title of a magazine article, along with the name of the
  magazine and which issue ("December, 1999" for example).
  <LI>The author, title, publisher, year of publication, and page or chapter
  numbers of a book.
  <LI>The vendor (company) name, title, date, and page numbers of a
  manual.
</UL>

<H2>How to Proceed</H2>

If you decide to do this assignment, proceed as follows:

<OL>

  <LI>Gather Information

  <BR>Read as much as you can.  There are a couple of web pages listed
  below to get you started.  Search the web and the library to find
  additional information.  Read it all and think about it.<p>

  <LI>Make an Outline
  <BR>Decide how you are going to organize what you have learned.  The
  idea is to tell people what overclocking is, why it is important, how
  it is done, what problems might be encountered, etc.  Decide whether
  you are going to write a broad overview of the topic (a survey paper)
  or delve deeply into a sub-topic that you found particularly
  interesting.  Decide on the structure for your paper.  There should be
  four major sections: an introduction, the main body of the paper, a
  brief summary, and a list of references.<p>

  <LI>Write Your Paper

  <BR>Once you have the structure set up write the paper.  It is very
  important that you use your own words as you write the paper.  Just
  cutting and pasting from your sources does not contitute "writing a
  paper!"  It's all right to include brief quotes from your sources,
  provided you make the quotes accurate, make it clear that they are
  quotes either by putting them inside quotation marks or (for longer
  ones) indented from the rest of the text, <I>and</I> indicate which
  source you are quoting by putting the number of the source from your
  reference list in square brackets at the end of the quote.

  <BR>Each abbreviation and technical term you use should be defined the
  first time you use it in your paper, except for "really obvious"
  things, like Hz.  For example:  "The PCI (Peripheral Component
  Interconnect) bus was patented ..."<p>

  <LI>Print It! <BR>Be sure the first page has the title of your paper
  and your name under that, both centered at the top of the page. 
  Number the pages either at the top or bottom of each page.
  <BR>Do not produce a web page for this; write the paper using a word
  processor and give me a printed copy.<p>

</OL>

<H2>Initial References</H2>

These are all web sites you can use to start your search for information
about overclocking.  Note that the last two are CPU vendor sites; look
for information on "chipsets" there.<p>
