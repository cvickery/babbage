<H1>Alternate Extra Credit Assignment</H1>
</center>

<H2>Overview</H2>

You may do any one of Exercises 43, 44, or 45 from the end of Chapter 3
for extra credit.  You cannot get extra credit for doing more than one
of these exercises, and you cannot get extra credit for doing both one of
these exercises and the [&nbsp;<a HREF="extra_credit_1.html">overclocking
paper</A>&nbsp;].

<H2>Guidelines</H2>

Your program may be written in Java, C, or C++.  (Consult me first if
you want to use a different language.)<p>

For <B>Exercise 43</B> you have to come up with an unambiguous grammar
for the wiring list.  Each input may be either a single number between
1 and <I>i</I>, or a pair of numbers specifying the row and column of
the gate involved.  Likewise, each output may be either a single number
between 1 and <I>j</I>, or a pair of numbers specifying the row and
column of the gate involved.  Do whatever you wish to solve this
problem.  Here's an idea: Java's StringTokenizer could be used to
separate strings into tokens that are terminated by either whitespace
or an equal sign.  Then your input file could look like this:

<pre>
    I=5 M=3 N=2 K=4
    i=3 r=2 c=1
    r=1 c=2 k=3
    r=1 c=2 r=3 c=1
</pre>

The first line provides the parameters for the chip, and the next three
lines define three wires.  The first wire goes from input number 3 to
the NAND gate at row 2, column 1; the second wire goes from the NAND
gate at row 1, column 2 to output number 3; the third wire goes from
the NAND gate at row 1, column2 to the NAND gate at row 3, column 1. 
Do not limit your program to working with single-digit numbers.<p>

Test your program with some "interesting" wiring patterns.  Can you
build a full adder?<p>

For <B>Exercises 44 and 45</B>, use . for AND, + for OR, and ~ for
NOT.<p>

For Exercise 44, consider this approach: Examine the expression
to determine how many different variables there are, and generate a
vector containing each combination of 1s and 0s for one row of the truth
table, and pass one row of the vector, plus the string representation of
the function to a method that evaluates the expression for those values
and returns the result.  This means parsing the expression for each row
of the truth table, but that's easier than compiling the the
expression into executable code.<p>

For Exercise 45, the task is to convert the expression into sum of
products form, which can be done using the technique for generating the
truth table for the expression suggested above.  Use o's and x's to
represent unblown and blown fuses, respectively.  Don't worry about that
"line printer" reference, just have your program output a 24x50 matrix
of characters representing the fuse matrix going into the AND gates and
another matirx, 6x50, representing the fuse matrix going into the OR
gates.

<H2>Grading Criteria</H2>

Code must be properly formatted, fully documented, and carefully tested.
(You supply the test data, but I will use additional data for testing
too).  It's OK for more than one person to work on one of these
programs, but the extra credit earned will be split among the authors. 
(Unless you tell me otherwise, I will split the extra credit points
equally among all authors.)<p>

This extra credit assignement, like the overclocking paper, can add up
to ten additonal points for your course average.<p>
