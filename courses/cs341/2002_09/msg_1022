  I have posted your homework assignment for October 23 on the web.  I
  have added a second part to the assignment, which is to implement
  your carry lookahead unit using CircuitMaker.  Because this is such
  short notice, I am making the second part of the assignment
  optional.  But I recommend very strongly that you do it whether you
  have it ready in time for Wednesday's class or not.
