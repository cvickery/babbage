I have updated the course schedule to give you your current reading
assignment and a link to the ARC simulator, which you should download
and become familiar with.  If you don't have Java installed on your
computer, you may need to download and install the "Java Runtime
Environment" from java.sun.com.

Have a good weekend,
Dr. Vickery
