I'm writing because I'm not sure everyone realizes that the parallel
ALU design and carry-lookahead topics will be on Monday's exam, along
with the sequential circuits we have been covering more recently.

If in doubt, look at the course schedule to see what has been covered
since the first exam.

Good luck!
