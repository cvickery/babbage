I have put a copy of last semester's first exam up on the web.  There
is a link to it from the course schedule web page.

I think the course schedule web page gives a good summary of what
material will be on the exam next Wednesday.  I suggest you use the
Discussion Board to ask questions as you prepare for the exam; I will
monitor the discussion board and answer questions if no one else does
so first.
