I've updated the "Check Grades" information for the course to show all
grades recorded for you for the semester.  In addition, there is a row
that shows what score you will need on the final exam to get a grade
of C or better in the course.  (The college's grading standards say
you  need an average of 73 to get a C; I calculated the lowest exam
score that would give you a course average of 72.5, which rounds to
the needed 73.)

In calculating your course average, I assigned weights of 0.3, 0.3,
and 0.4 to the three exams, and if the lowest exam score is 10 points
or more below the middle one, reduced the offending score's weight by
0.1 and added 0.05 to the weights of the other two.  Then I computed
the proportion of homework assignments that you submitted (Using 7 as
the maximum, even though some people submitted 8), and if that
proportion, times 100, is greater than the weighted average of your
exam grades, I have counted that number as 2% of your course average.
Finally, I added one tenth of your quiz score to get your course
average.
