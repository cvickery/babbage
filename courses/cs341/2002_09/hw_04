The solutions to Homework 4 are posted on the web; there is a link to
them on the course schedule page.  In addition to the diagrams, the
solutions page has a link to a CircuitMaker file you can run to test
the circuits.  Be sure it ends up with a .ckt extension when you
download it.

Also, the sample exam's first question is correct when I look at it on
the web, but was messed up when some people printed it out.  The
question is supposed to say, "What is the 8-bit two's complement
representation of -108 base ten?"  (The subscript 10 at the end
printed on the same level as the first part of the number for some
people so it looked like -10810.)  The answer, by the way, is 1001
0100 in binary, or 0x94.  The answer to the second question, then, is
0110 1100 in binary, or 0x6C.
