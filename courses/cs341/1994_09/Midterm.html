<LI>What is the formula to determine the execution time of a program.
For each of the three terms in this formula, tell whether RISC
or CISC processors do a better job of minimizing the term.
<LI>If a program spends 25% of its running time doing integer
division, how much speedup would be achieved by adding hardware
that makes integer division run twice as fast?
<LI>How many bits are needed to provide addresses for a 128 KB
memory?
<LI>Describe the format of the MIPS <I>slt</I> instruction. Tell
the number of bits for each field, and what the instruction does.
<LI>Show the format of the MIPS <I>bne</I> instruction. Tell the
number of bits for each field, what the instruction does, and
how the branch target address is computed.
<LI>Show the format of the MIPS <I>jmp</I> instruction. Tell the
number of bits for each field, what the instruction does, and
how the branch target address is computed.
<LI>Draw the gates to implement a multiplexor with two control
inputs. Label all inputs and outputs.
<LI>Draw a diagram showing the internal structure of cell number
31 for the ALU designed in the textbook for a MIPS processor.
<LI>Tell the reason for implementing carry-lookahead logic. Give
the equations for carry generate and carry propagate and for C1
through C3.
<LI>Complete the given rows of the following truth table for the
four-bit parallel adder-subtracter designed in class. Answer on
this sheet. Notes: <I>a/s</I> is the add/subtract control (0 means
add), <I>c</I> is the carry out of the left-most bit, <I>v</I>
is the arithmetic overflow indicator, <I>n</I> is the negative
result indicator, and <I>z</I> is the zero result indicator. You
do not have to show the values for B' as we did in class.
