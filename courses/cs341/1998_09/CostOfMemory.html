The graph shows that in general, the cost per bit increases with the
capacity of the storage module, but not uniformly.<p>

There are a few points to observe about the structure of this graph,
aside from the information content:

<OL>

  <LI>The Y axis is used to represent the values computed from the
  numbers provided.  In general, the Y axis represents the <I>dependent
  variable</I>, and the X axis represents the <I>independent
  variable</I>.
  
  <li>The data points are connected with straight lines.  Unless you are
  doing "curve fitting," which means to develop a formula to represent
  the shape of the function, never use curved lines to connect data
  points.
  
  <li>The Unit size for the Y access is microcents per bit.  You were
  asked to calculate the cost in cents per bit, but you should scale the
  data so that the axis can be labeled with integer values.
  
  <li>The title of the graph conveys the overall content of the graph,
  and the axis labels give the units of measure used for the numerical
  values shown.
