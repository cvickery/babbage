<H3><B>Remember</B>, homeworks are graded, so you must do your own
work.  If you do not follow this policy, you will be given a failing
grade in the course, and risk college disciplinary action.</H3>

<B>Due Date:</B> October 30, 1998<p>

<B>Assignment:</B> Write the truth table for a full-adder, and then draw
the gates to implement one.  Draw one set of wires and inverters to
produce values for the literals A, ~A, B, ~B, C<sub>in</sub>, and
~C<sub>in</sub>.  Then use this part of the circuit, plus additional
gates, to generate values for both Sum and C<sub>out</sub>.  Use just
AND and OR gates to generate the two outputs.  (That is, don't use any
XOR gates for this homework.)
