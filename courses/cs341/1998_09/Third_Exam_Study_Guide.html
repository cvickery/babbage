<H1>Study Guide for Exam 3</H1>
<H2>December 22, 1998</H2>
</center>

The exam will cover the material in Appendix B, including latches,
flip-flops, register file design, and memory system design (using my
memory system design web page as a supplement).  It will also cover
Chapter 5 up through Section 5.4.<p>

There will be special emphasis on Figures 5.21, 5.33, 5.34, 5.42, and
5.43.  We also covered Figures C.3 and C.5 from Appendix C as well as
pages C-8 through C-13.

<H2>Sample Questions</H2>
<OL>
  <LI>Tell what values would be loaded into each of the registers of
  the multi-cycle design at the end of State 1.  Explain how each value
  is determined.
  <LI>An implementation of the MIPS datapath requires 2 nsec to access
  memory or to do an ALU/adder operation, and 1 nsec to read or write
  the register file.  Assume the following instructin mix: 24% loads,
  12% stores, 44% R-format instructions, 18% branches, and 2% jumps.
  Assuming that the multiplexors, control unit, PC accesses, sign
  extension unit, and wires have no delay, how long would the clock
  period be for the two designs developed in Chapter 5 (one clock per
  instruction and multiple clocks per instruction).  What would be the
  average CPI for the two designs?  Which design would be faster, and by
  how much?
  <LI>Draw a circuit that implements the "Sign extend" ovals in Figures
  5.21 and 5.33
