Computer Science 341
Exam 2

November 7, 1995

Since the last exam, we have covered Chapter 3 and the following chapters
of the text:

  Chapter 4, sections 4.1 through 4.7
  Appendix B, pages B-1 through B-25; B-33-B-35.

  As promised in class, this exam will *not* cover the the ways in which
  various branch instructions calculate their target addresses.  That
  will be covered on the final exam.  However, you are responsible for
  basic MIPS instruction formats and the relationship between assembly
  code and machine instruction fields.

  Also, the test will include some but not all of the material from
  Appendix B that was covered in class on November 3.  You are
  responsible for decoders, but not for programmable logic from that
  class.
