Examination Topics
Computer Science 341
Exam 1
September 29, 1995

The exam will cover all of chapters 1, 2, plus sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3,
and 4.8.  The exam will also cover material dealt with in class that
does not appear in the parts of the text listed here.

Homework exercises provide a model for the types of quesions that will
be asked.  Also, you may use lynx (or other Web browser) to look at a
couple of previous exams that I have given for this course (but not
specifically this material) at http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341.

Here is a list of topics we have covered so far:

Processor Structure: datapath, control, memory.
CPU/memory interactions (read/write, address/data/control)
State Transitions (high-level language statements, machine/assembly
	language instructions, register-transfer operations).
Clock pulses cause register-transfer state transitions.

Physical units of magnitude (giga, mega, kilo and their corresponding
power of two near-equivalents (30, 20, 10); milli, micro, nano, pico).
Converting between period and frequency.

Encoding Information in Binary
  Arbitrary information (days of the week, faces of a die, etc.)
  Audio information (sampling rate, bits per sample)
  Visual information (number of pixels, bits per pixel; CRT control)
  Numeric Information
    Fixed-Point
      Unsigned
      Signed
        Two's Complement
        Biased
    Floating Point
      IEEE-754 single precision
      IEEE-754 double precision
  Two's complement arithmetic
    Carry
    Overflow
