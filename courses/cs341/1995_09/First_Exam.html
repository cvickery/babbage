1. Tell the number of bits needed to encode the members of the
following information classes:
<UL>
<LI>The faces of a die
<LI>The days of the week
<LI>Any unsigned integer between zero and 255<SUB>10</SUB>
<LI>Any signed integer between -1024<SUB>10</SUB> and +1023<SUB>10</SUB>
<LI>The address of any byte in the memory of a computer with as
much as 4GB of memory
</UL>
<P>
2. Give the IEEE-754 single and double precision representations
of +85.3125<SUB>10</SUB>.  Answer in hexadecimal.  Show all work.
<P>
3. A. What is the decimal value of 0xFFFD if it is a 16-bit two's
complement number?
<P>
 B. What would be the 32-bit representation of the same value?
(Answer in hexadecimal)
<P>
4. Give the 8-bit two's complement representations of the decimal
numbers +64 and &#173;25.  Answer in hexadecimal.
<P>
5. For each of the following arithmetic sums, write the binary
equivalent of each operand and the result using two's complement
representation.  Each operand and result is to use exactly four
bits.  Mark a zero or one in each box in the Carry and Overflow
columns to indicate the value of the carry out of the leftmost
position and whether there is arithmetic overflow (1) or not (0).

6. Assume that the interface between a CPU and a memory consists
of 24 address wires, 8 data wires, and three control wires named
<I>read, write,</I> and <I>wait.</I>
<OL>
<LI>Use complete English sentences to tell the sequence of events
that would take place for the CPU to read the contents of memory
address 0x1234.  For each step, tell whether the CPU or the memory
performs the step and which wires it controls.
<LI>Same as (a) for writing 0x3F into the byte at address 0x01000.
<LI>If the memory access time is 350 nanoseconds and the CPU clock
rate is 100 MHz, how many wait states will the processor incur
for each memory access?  Show all work.
</OL>
<P>
7. A program is run on two different computers.  On computer A
the program requires 100,000 instructions, the average cycles
per instruction is 2.0, and the Clock rate is 100 Mhz.  On computer
B the program requires 20,000 instructions, the average cycles
per instruction is 10.0, and the clock rate 75 MHz.  Which computer
is faster, and by how much?  (The instruction counts are dynamic,
not static.)  Show all work.  <I>Bonus:</I>  Which computer uses
a RISC processor?
<P>
8. Engineers can make their company's new processor either perform
floating-point operations twice as fast or perform string operations
1.2 times faster compared to the current processor they are selling.
 They did a survey of their customers and established that the
average program spends 5% of the time doing floating-point operations,
and 30% of the time doing string operations.  Assume it costs
the same amount of money to implement either optimization but
that they can't do both for some reason.  Which one should they
do?  Show all work.
