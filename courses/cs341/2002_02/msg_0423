I have posted the grades for your second exam.  When you check your
grade, you will also find a value for something called "Need for C,"
which is the minimum grade you will need to score on the final exam in
order to receive a grade of C in the course.  The score listed there
is my best guess at this point; I can't guarantee that my grading
formula won't change some at the end of the term.  But it should be
quite accurate.
