</center>

<h2>Class Meetings</h2>

Tuesdays, and from 10:00 to 10:50 AM on Fridays.<p>
Section E6TPA meets from 6:00 to 7:15 PM on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  At

<h2>Office Hours</h2> Most office hour business can be handled by
email.  My address is vickery at qc dot edu.  Be sure to include
"CS-341" in the subject line of every message you send me, and be sure
to include your name in the body of each message.<p>

If you want to see me in person, I will be available in my office,
Science Building room A-222, for half an hour after each class for the
day section, and by appointment for half an hour before class for the
evening section. I will also be available Tuesday and Thursday
evenings from 8:45 to 9:10, but I may be in SB D-133 instead of my office
then.<p>

<h2>Textbooks</h2>

There is one textbook for the course:

  <tr>
    <td>

    Murdocca, Miles J. and Heuring, Vincent P.<br>
    <i>Principles of Computer Architecture</i><br>
    Prentice Hall, 2000<br>
    ISBN 0-201-43664-7<p>

</table></center>

  We will be covering material from chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and
  Appendices A and B.  Reading assignments are on the [&nbsp;<a
  href="./schedule.html#schedule">Course Schedule</a>&nbsp;] web page.

<h2>Homework and Exams</h2>

<ul>
  <li>There will be several homework assignments, but they will count only 5%
  of your course grade.  That is, if there are ten homework assignments, each one
  will count 0.5% of your course average.<p>

  You must submit your own homework solutions, but you are free to work
  on the homework assignments with anyone you wish; the idea is to use
  the homework as a way to reinforce the material in the course, not as a
  test of your knowledge.  I will record whether or not you hand in
  homeworks by the assigned due dates, but I will not evaluate your
  homework in any way.  Instead, I will send the solutions to you by
  email after the assignment due date.<p>
  
  <li>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  The two
  midterms will count 30% each, and the final will count 35%.  Each
  exam will cover approximately 1/3 of the course (see the [&nbsp;<a
  href="./schedule.html">Course Schedule</a>&nbsp;] web page for
  dates), and the final exam will include some reveiw material from
  earlier parts of the course (about 15% of the exam).<p>

  If your lowest exam score is ten points or less below your middle exam
  score, its weight will be reduced by 10% and the weights of the other
  two exams will be increased by 5% each.<p>
</ul>

<h2>Check Your Grades</h2>

  You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework and exams
  at the <i>Check Grades</i> link from your section's course schedule.
  To use this facility, you will need to enter your student ID
  number and a "code word."  The code word is like a password, but it
  is not as secure as a real password because you must tell me what it
  is in order to set it up.  (<b>Never send a real password to anyone,
  not even a professor!</b>)  See the link to <i>Homework Assignment
  1</i> on your section's course schedule for details.<p>

  Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.
