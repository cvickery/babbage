I have posted the final exam and course grades for CS-341 on the web.

I curved the final exam scores by ten points(!), so the highest score
was over 100; the class average was about 82.

Overall, in the two sections of CS-341 I taught, there were 11 A's, 14
B's, 9 C's, 7 D's, and 4 F's in the course.

I hope you have a great summer,
Dr. Vickery
