<h1>Exercise A-29</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>
Design a circuit that produces a 1 at the Z output when the input X
changes from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0, and that produces a zero at all
other times. ... Show the state transition diagram, the state table,
state assignment, and the final circuit using MUXes.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

We will use two state flip-flops, S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>0</sub>. 
S<sub>0></sub> will represent the most recently received value of X, and
S<sub>1</sub> will represent the previous value.  The state table looks
like this:<p>

Note that I have adopted the non-standard convention of labeling the
arcs "X/Z", where Z is the output value in the state the arc comes
<i>from</i> rather than the state the arc goes <i>to</i>.  This
convention makes it easier to design the circuit as a <i>Moore
Machine</i>, in which the output value depends only on the current
state.<p>

Using this convention, we can construct a state table looks like the
following:

<pre>
        Present External |  Next    External
         State   Inputs  |  State   Outputs
        ------------------------------------
         S<sub>1</sub>  S<sub>0</sub>    X      |  D<sub>1</sub> D<sub>0</sub>      Y
        ------------------------------------
         0   0     0     |  0   0      0
         0   0     1     |  0   1      0
         0   1     0     |  1   0      1
         0   1     1     |  1   1      1
         1   0     0     |  0   0      1
         1   0     1     |  0   1      1
         1   1     0     |  1   0      0
         1   1     1     |  1   1      0
</pre>

The first two rows of this table would be interpreted as follows:  "If
the present state is 00, the output is zero.  If the external input
during state 00 is 0, the next state will be 00 again, but if the
external input is 1, the next state will be 01."  The next two rows would
be interpeted to say, "If the present state is 01, the external output
is 1.  If the external input is 0, the next state will be 10, but if it
is 1, the next state will be 11.<p>

We could minimize the three functions on the right side of the state
table using Karnaugh Maps, but D<sub>1</sub> can be seen to be equal to
S<sub>0</sub> by inspection, saving a bit of work.  Likewise,
D<sub>0</sub> can be seen by inspection to be the same as X.  Finally,
we can also see by inspection that Z is true if and only if
S<sub>1</sub> is different from S<sub>0</sub>, that is Z = S<sub>1</sub>
<i>xor</i> S<sub>0</sub>.

Thus, the following circuit implements the entire state machine:
