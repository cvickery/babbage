<H1 ALIGN=center>Memory System Design</H1>

This page presents a coherent view of the design of a static RAM (SRAM)
memory system.  It is intended to complement the presentation of this
topic as it is covered on pages B-26 through B-31 of <i>Computer
Organization & Design: The Hardware/Software Interface (Second Ed.)</i>
by Patterson and Hennessy (Morgan-Kaufmann, 1998).  This page is a
complement to the presentation in the Patterson and Hennessy text, not
a substitute for it.<p>

The problem with the Patterson and Hennesy presentation is that it
is inconsistent or incomplete as it crosses the three levels of the
design: binary cells, SRAM ICs, and Memory System.  The three levels are
treated consistently in this document.<p>

<H2>Binary Cell Design</H2>

We begin with the design of a circuit which can store one bit of a memory,
a single binary cell.  The text does not introduce this level separately,
and it is not clear what the <i>Enable</i> inputs to the binary cells control
when they are used in Figure B.23.  The following diagram shows a clocked
D latch augmented with a tristate buffer controlled by an <i>Enable</i> input
to the latch:<p>

<H2>SRAM IC Design</H2>

Here is a version of Figure B.23 that is consistent with the block
diagram given in Figure B.21 of the text.  Each output of the decoder
goes to two AND gates, one for reading and one for writing.  In
addition, the Chip Select input to the RAM IC is connected to the
<i>Enable</i> input of the decoder, which is shown in the next figure.
The other difference between this figure and B.23 is that it indicates
how the word size of the IC would be expanded beyond two bits per
word.  Look at the right side of the diagram, and the labels for the
data input and data output lines.<p>

Central to the design of the SRAM IC is that the entire chip can be
disabled so that it neither writes or supplies output data.  This is
done by making the <i>Chip Select</i> input false.  To accomplish this,
we simply add an additional input to each of the AND gates inside the
decoder part of the chip:<p>

<H2>Memory System</H2>

Figure B.24 of the text shows how an array of SRAM ICs can be connected
to build a memory system.  Unfortuantely, it is incomplete in that it
does not indicate how write operations could be performed.  Since the
bits for several words (64) are stored at the same address in each IC,
writing is complicated: to write into one word would require reading
the locations of all the ICs (giving 64 words), the required word would
then be changed, and all 64 words (including the one modified word)
would have to be rewritten.  This complexity is not actually a problem
in a memory system that supports cache, since multiple words of primary
memory are normally transferred between primary memory and cache memory
anyway.  It's just that Figure B.24 would be even more difficult to
understand if the writing part of it was included.<p>

As an alternative, here is the design of a 4Mx32 memory system built
from 2Mx8 SRAM ICs.  The upper part of the figure is a block diagram
showing the number of address and data bits for the entire memory
system.<p>

As this design illustrates, the dimensions of the matrix of SRAM ICs in
the memory system can be derived as follows:  The number of rows of ICs
equals the ratio of the number of words in the memory system to the
number of words per IC, and the number of columns of ICs equals the
ratio of the number of bits per word in the memory system to the number
of bits per word per IC.  Of course, this structure applies only when
both ratios are one or greater, which is not the case in Figure B.24 of
the text.  Also, note that the number of rows of ICs determines the
structure of the decoder in the memory system, and the number of
address bits that must go into this decoder.<p>

Finally, we note that the designs presented here and in the textbook
are intended only to show the principles of designing a memory system. 
In the real world, the situation is complicated by the need to provide
a mechanism for implementing subsets of a memory system in a
distributed fashion.  In general, this means that the logic for
decoding address bits into <i>chip select</i> wires will have to be
partitioned across multiple memory modules or circuit boards.<p>
