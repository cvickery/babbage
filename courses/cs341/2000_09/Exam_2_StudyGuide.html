<H1>Exam 2 Study Guide</H1>
</center>

The exam will be based on material covered in class, and material in
Sections 3.1 through 3.3.1 in the textbook.  This means that some of the
material covered in Homework 6 will not be on the exam.<p>

One topic covered in class but not in the textbook is minimization, but
you have the web page I prepared,
[&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/Minimize">http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/Minimize</A>&nbsp;]
to help you study this topic.  You should be able to convert a truth
table into a network of gates, you should be able to convert a network
of gates into a truth table, you should be able to convert a truth table
into an algebraic expression, and you should be able to convert an
algebraic expression into either a truth table or a logic network.  You
should be able to minimize expressions of 3 or 4 variables using a
Karnaugh Map, and you should be able to minimize an algebraic
expression.  In the case of an algebraic expression you will <I>not</I>
be responsible for finding more than one minimization.  (In the language
of the minimization web page, all you have to do is to compute the prime
implicants.)  Terms about boolean expressions that you should know
include <I>minterm</I>, <I>literal</I>, and <I>disjunctive normal
form</I> (or sum of products form).<p>

A second topic covered in class but not in the textbook is the PAL and
PROM programmable logic devices; the text covers only PLAs.  For all
three types of devices, you should be able to answer questions about
number of inputs, number of inverters, number of AND gates, number of OR
gates, number of outputs, maximum number of minterms, and total number
of fuses, given the parameters describing a particular device.  You
should be able to draw the gates/fuses diagrams for all three types of
devices, and you should be able to program any type of device to
implement any truth table that will fit in the device.<p>

A third topic covered in class but not in the textbook is the logic for
producing condition code values from an ALU (Carry, oVerflow, Negative,
and Zero).<p>

The material on carry lookahead logic is not covered in the body of the
text, but there was homework about it, and I went over it in class, so
that material will be on the test.  You should be able to give the
equations for any value of C<SUB>i</SUB>. You should be able to draw the
gates to implment those functions, you should understand the idea behind
carry lookahead logic, and you should be able to show how the adder used
for carry lookahead logic differs from full and half adders.<p>

Table 4-2 of the text book (page 206) shows how the ALU control bits can
be set to achieve various computations.  There are alternative settings
that will accomplish the same thing.  A "nice" exam question is to ask
you for two different ways to perform some operaation.  You had homework
questions like this.  You should be able to draw any or all parts of a
1-bit ALU, either as shown in Figure 3-19 or as done in class.<p>

You should be able to define <I>fan in</I>, <I>fan out</I>, and
<I>propagation delay</I>.<p>

You should be able to translate among truth tables, equations, and logic
networks.  You should be able to implement functions of <I>n</I>
variables using multiplexers with <I>n-1</I> control inputs, you should
be able to draw the gates to implement decoders, multiplexers, full
adders, etc.  You do not have to be able to draw the transistors used
to implement a gate, but you should be familiar with the "Vickery model"
of a gate and explain how that relates to fan out.<p>

There may be more, but this seems like enough to keep you busy for a
while!<p>
