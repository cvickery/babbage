I covered minimization in class, but it isn't covered too
deeply in the textbook, so I've put together a web page on
the topic that you can study from.  There is also a Java
program there that you can run to see the minimization
process at work.

The URL is

  http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/Minimize

Please let me know about problems you have with this
material.  Let me know what is unclear, as well as about the
typographical errors you find in the web page and the bugs
you find in the program.  Thanks.
