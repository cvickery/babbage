  3.  With three variables, the truth table has 8 rows, so a function
  can be described by an 8-bit number.  Thus 256 functions exist.  With
  n variables, the truth table has k=2^n rows, and there are 2^k
  functions.

  4.  Here is the truth table:
                 _       _
      P  Q | PQ PQ (PQ)+PQ
      -----|--------------
      0  0 |  0  0     0
      0  1 |  0  0     0
      1  0 |  0  1     1
      1  1 |  1  0     1


  5.  Use one NAND gate to combine the two inputs, then connect the
  output of that gate to both inputs of a second NAND, which will act
  as an inverter, giving the complement of NAND, which is AND.

  6.  By DeMorgan's Law:
  
      __       _
       _   _   _   _
      AB = A + B = A + B

  7.  Inputs D1, D2, D4, and D7 are all connected to the plus side of
  the power supply (logic 1), and the other inputs are all connected to
  ground (logic 0).

  8.  The idea is that you can use any three of the variables as control
  intputs to the multiplexor, let's say variables A, B, and C.  Then
  each of the 8 inputs of the multiplexor will represent two rows of the
  truth table, one where D is zero and one where D is one.  These row
  pairs will either have output values of 0 and 0 (put 0 into the
  corresponding input of the multiplexor), 0 and 1 (put D into the
  corresponding input), 1 and 0 (put ~D into the corresponding input)
  or 1 and 1 (put 1 into the corresponding input.)  For the problem
  given, and using A, B, and C as the controls, the inputs to the
  multiplexor, starting with input number 0, would be: D, 1, 0, 1, ~D,
  ~D, 0, and D.
