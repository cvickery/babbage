Here is a checklist of topics that may be covered on next
Friday's exam.

Don't forget to use the floating-point calculator web pages
when practicing conversions between decimal and IEEE-754
encodings.  There are three of them, each with links to the
others at the bottom.  The first one is at:

  http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754.html

And don't forget that last semester's exams are available on
the web.  Follow the links from the course home page.

Good luck!

========================================

  Define information and define the bit in information-theoretic terms.

  Determine how many bits are needed to encode various sets of
  information, including the days of the week, the months of the year,
  decimal, octal, and hexadecimal digits, ASCII, ISO-Latin-1, and
  Unicode characters, memory addresses for different memory capacities.

  Units of measure.  Converting frequency to period, using the correct
  units.

  Measuring computer performance: Sec/Prog = Instr/Prog x Clocks/Instr
  x Sec/Clock.

  RISC vs CISC Instruction Set Architectures

  Datapath structure

  Memory operations and the memory hierarchy.  Cache concepts.

  Memory addressing.

  Parity and Hamming Codes.

  Concepts of audio encoding:  Transducers, analog/digital and
  digital/analog converters, sampling rate, bits per sample.

  Concepts of video encoding:  CRT structure, pixels, framebuffers,
  raster scan, refresh rate.

  Hard disk structure; seek time, rotational delay, transfer rate.

  CD-ROM structure

  Fixed-point numbers and arithmetic

  Floating-point numbers and arithmetic

  Character codes (ASCII, ISO-Latin-1, Unicode).

  Multilevel Machines

  Moore's Law
