<H1>CS-341 Extra Credit Options</H1>
</center>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Your grade in CS-341 will be the numerical average of your three exam
grades, with the proviso that if one exam grade is ten points less than
the lower of the other two, the weight of that exam will be reduced from
o.33 to 0.23, and the other two exams will count 0.38 each.  There may
also be a point or two in your grade based on whether you handed in
homework regularly or not.<p>

This document gives you some options for improving your grade by doing
extra work for the course.  One option is to write a paper, and the
other is to write a computer program.  You may choose either option (or
neither), but not both.  The paper and program options are described
below.  If you choose to do one of the options, it will count as an
extra exam, which will be averaged in with the three real exams, with
the following adjustments:

<UL>
  <LI>Your extra credit work will be ignored if it would lower your
  grade in the course.

  <LI>Each exam and the extra credit work will count 25% of your course
  average, but if one exam grade is ten points less than the lower of
  the other two, the weight of that exam will be reduced to 0.15, the
  other two will have weights of 0.30 each, and the extra credit work
  will still count 0.25.
</UL>

<H2>The Paper Option</H2>

Write a paper 5 to 10 pages long comparing the architectures of two or
more currently-used computer systems.  You may focus on either the
internal architectures of CPUs (Intel Celeron, Pentium III, or Pentium
IV; AMD Athlon, Duron, or T-bird) or on their associated chip sets and
busses (RAMBUS, DDRRAM, SDRAM; Intel and Via chipsets).<p>

Your paper should be in four parts: An introduction that tells what two
systems you are going to compare and why they are important, two
sections describing the two systems, and a final section that compares
the two.<p>

Your paper will be graded on how clearly written and organized it is,
as well as the technical content.  For information on the expected
writing style, consult [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://www.techcommunicators.com/stylegui/stylegd.html">The
Technical Communicators Resource Site</A>&nbsp;] by Duncan Kent &
Associates Ltd. of Vancouver, BC, Canada.  (I've found that access to
this web site is very slow, but the quality of the material available
there is very high.)<p>

You may draw on material from printed publications (technical books and
magazines, etc.) and/or web material.  Web sites to consult include the
vendors who produce the processors and/or chip sets, such as Intel
[&nbsp;<a HREF="http://www.intel.com">www.intel.com</A>&nbsp;],
Advanced Micro Devices [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://www.amd.com">www.amd.com</A>&nbsp;] VIA Technologies
[&nbsp;<a HREF="http://www.viatech.com">www.viatech.com</A>&nbsp;], and
the sites that provide vendor-neutral information, such as [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://www.arstechnica.com">www.arstechnica.com</A>&nbsp;],
[&nbsp;<a HREF="http://www.slashdot.com">www.slashdot.com</A>&nbsp;],

HREF="http://www.aceshardware.com">www.aceshardware.com</A>&nbsp;], and
[&nbsp;<a HREF="http://www.geek.com">www.geek.com</A>&nbsp;].<p>

Here are some specific links to Intel pages you can look at:
<UL>

  <LI>[&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://developer.intel.com/update/contents/dt12006.htm">developer.intel.com/update/contents/dt12006.htm</A>&nbsp;]

  <LI>[&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://developer.intel.com/update/contents/dt12002.htm">developer.intel.com/update/contents/dt12002.htm</A>&nbsp;]

  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="http://developer.intel.com/update">developer.intel.com/update</A>&nbsp;]

</UL>
You may modify the suggested topic given here provided you send
me email describing what you want to do and get my approval ahead of
time.<p>

<B>NOTE:</B>  You <I>must</I> cite the sources of all material you used
to prepare your paper in the following two ways:

<OL>

  <LI>Provide a numbered list of your references at the end of your
  paper, giving complete publication information for each one.  There
  is an example in the <B>References</B> section at the end of this web
  page.  (For a book, this means the author, title, publisher, and date
  of publication; for an article it means the author, title,
  publication name, page numbers, and date of publication; for a web
  page, it means the author, the page's title (the one that appears in
  the title bar of your navigator), and the complete URL for the web
  page.

  <LI>Each idea in your paper must be expressed in your own words, and
  followed by the number(s), in square brackets, of the reference(s)
  where the idea came from.  For example, if I wanted to cite this web
  page in my paper, the sentence that talks about it would look like
  this one.[1]

</OL>

Each item in the list of references must be cited at least once in the
body of the paper.<p>

<I>Failing to cite your sources of information accurately is as serious
an error as having someone else write your paper for you in academic
circles, so be sure to do this right.</I><P>

<H2>The Programming Option</H2>

This option is essentially the same as Exercise 44 at the end of
Chapter 3.  You are to write a program in Java, C, or C++ that compares
two logical expressions to see if they are equivalent.  That is, to see
if they have the same truth tables.<P>

The steps your program should go through are:

<OL>

  <LI>Read two expressions from the user, either interactively
  or as command line arguments.  The two expressions are entered as
  strings of characters.

  <LI>Determine how many variables there are by scanning the two
  strings.  Given the total number of different variables in the two
  expressions, you know how many rows the two truth tables must have. 
  (They both have to have the same number of rows.)

  <LI>Evaluate both expressions for every row of its truth
  table.

  <LI>Display the two truth tables and a message that tells
  whether they are the same or diffferent.

</OL>

Here are some features to consider in designing your program:

<UL>

    <LI>The syntax of the expressions entered should be as natural as
    possible.

    <LI>There should be no limit on the number of variables in an
    expression.

    <LI>Spaces shouldn't matter.

    <LI>It's reasonable to allow only single-letter variable names. 

    <LI>You decide whether variable names are case sensitive or not.

    <LI>You decide what symbol to use for NOT, and whether it is a
    prefix or postfix operator.  Someone asked about using uppercase
    letters for negated variables and lowercase letters for the same
    variables un-negated.  That's okay too.

    <LI>You can either require all AND operators to be entered
    explicitly, or add them yourself when they are missing.  (For
    example, you could automatically convert "abc" into "a*b*c"; it can
    be tricky to get this right when using parentheses and NOTs.)

    <LI>AND should have precedence over OR, and NOT should have
    precedence over AND.  Optional:  Allow XOR, with precedence
    equal to OR.

    <LI>Be sure to handle parentheses properly.

</UL>

Here is a basic algorithm for evaluating an expression for <U>one
row</U> of a truth table:

<OL>

    <LI>Create two pushdown stacks, one for operators, and one for
    operands.

    <LI>Create a new string with the proper zeros and ones substituted
    for all the variables.  (You have to convert the row number of the
    truth table into the proper set of ones and zeros.)
    
    <LI>Going from left to right, examine each character in the
    expression.

    <UL>

      <LI>If the character is a left parenthesis push it onto the
      operator stack.
      
      <LI>If the character is an operand, push it onto the operand stack.

      <LI>If the character is an operator, repeatedly evaluate the top
      operator on the operator stack by combining two operands from the
      operand stack and pushing the result back onto the operand stack;
      do this for each operator on the operator stack that has higher
      precedence than the current operator.  Then push the current
      operator onto the operator stack.

      <LI>If the character is a right parenthesis, repeatedly process
      operators from the operator stack until reaching a left parenthesis.

    </UL>
    <LI>When the end of the expresion is reached, evaluate any operators
    remaining on the operator stack.  This should leave exactly one value
    on the operand stack, which is the value of the expression for that
    row of the truth table.
    
</OL>


Your program will be graded on coding style and documentation as well
as correctness and robustness.  (It should print a meaningful error
message if there is a syntax error in either expression, instead of
crashing or generating the wrong answer.)<p>

Be sure to tell me exactly what syntax your program requires for
entering the expressions.


<H2>Due Date and Collaboration</H2>

You may work with a partner on one of these options, but the two of you
will have to share the score earned.  That is, the paper or program
would count as half an exam each for each of you.<P>

Put a printed copy of your paper, or a diskette containing the source
code for your program, in my mailbox (SB Room A-202) or under my office
door (SB Room A-222) by 5:00 PM on December 22.  Alternatively, you can
submit your material via email as late as midnight on December 22.
