<H2 align=center>Dr. C. Vickery</H2>

Computer Science 341 is a required course for undergraduate majors
who have matriculated in either the BA or BS program. It is an
introduction to the design of a computer's hardware, particularly
the CPU and memory systems.

<!--
<H3>Homework Assignments</H3>

The homework assignments are announced in class, and are
repeated on the web page for this term.<p>

<H3>Homework Policies</H3>

Homework assignments for this course are graded, which means that
<I>you must hand in your own work</I>!  It's all right to talk with
others about the assignments, but you must do the exercises yourself. 
The rule to follow is that there must be no exchange of written
(electronic or otherwise) solutions between people.  <B>Failure to
abide by this policy will result in failure in the course!</B><p>

Homework assignments are due on the date indicated, but will be accepted
for "late" credit until the next class after the due date.  I use the
following grades for homework:<BR>

<blockquote><TABLE border cellpadding=3>

  <TR>
      <TD><B>Good</B>
      <TD>4 points

  <TR>
      <TD><B>OK</B>
      <TD>3 points (full credit)

  <TR>
      <TD><B>Not OK</B>
      <TD>1 or 2 points

  <TR>
      <TD><B>Late</B>
      <TD>Subtract 1 point from above

</TABLE></blockquote>

<p>
At the end of the term, I will sum all your homework grades and compute
an average that will count approximately 10% of your course
grade.<p>

The first web page was originally developed by a Queens College student,
Quanfei Wen, and subsequently modified and extended by Kevin Brewer of
Delco Electronics.  Kevin also wrote the other three pages listed.<p>

The web pages use JavaScript programs to do the arithmetic operations,
and Kevin has added a lot of comments describing the IEEE-754 formats to
the code.  You can use your browser's "View->Page Source" menu choices
(or equivalent) to look at the JavaScript code and comments.<p>

Many thanks to Fei for the original page, and to Kevin for all the work
he put into them, and for making his work available to us.

<H3> Memory Systems </H3>

I have prepared a supplement to the textbook's coverage of memory
system design in Appendix B.  To access my supplement <A

<H3>SPIM Simulator</H3>

There is a simulation of the MIPS processor that can be run under
Windows 3.x or Windows 95/NT.  Its use is not required for this course,
but if you would like to use it to deepen your knowledge of MIPS machine
and assembly language, you can get a copy of it by clicking on <A
HREF="ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/spimwin.exe">this link to a
copy that I have made at Queens College</A>.  If you want to be sure you
have the very latest version, you can follow <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/pub/spim/spimwin.exe">this link to the
original copy at the University of Wisconsin</A>.  (I made the local
copy on February 2, 1998.)  I have it on a diskette that you can borrow,
too.<p>

<H2>Previous Exams</H2>

Here are some links to previous exams for the course. There is no
guarantee that this semester's exams will look at all like the ones you
find here.  In fact, with the change in textbook for the Fall 1999
term, the exams are sure to be very different!  But the exam style will
be similar to these.<p>

Note also that there was just a midterm and a final exam in some
previous semesters, but there will be three exams this semester.<P>
