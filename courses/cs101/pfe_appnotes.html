<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app001.htm"><B>Note 1 : Opening More Than One File At Once</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>By default, PFE lets you open only one file at a time from the various file opening dialogs that you can use. </P>

<P>This behaviour differs from some earlier releases, which allowed you to open many files at the same time; this note explains why the change was made, and shows how you can turn multiple selection back on. </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app002.htm"><B>Note 2 : RightAlt+ Letter does not drop menu items</B></A></LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>If you have a US keyboard and are using the 32 Bit Edition, you may find that you can't access menu items by holding the right-hand <B>Alt</B> key down and typing the hot-key letter </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app003.htm"><B>Note 3 : Files With Spaces In Their Names Are Not Handled Properly</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>You may think that the 32-Bit Edition of PFE can't handle long file names that contain spaces - double clicking on them in Windows Explorer says that they don't exist. </P>

<P>In fact, this is because you haven't set things up quite correctly - the note explains all </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app004.htm"><B>Note 4 : 16-Bit Edition Does Not Allow User Help Files To Be Defined</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>With the 16-Bit Edition of version 0.07.001, the <I>"User Help Files"</I> panel of the <B>Options Preferences </B>dialog does not work correctly. This note explains how you can work around the problem </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app005.htm"><B>Note 5 : Import Of Registry Configuration Set Fails</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>With the 32-Bit Edition of version 0.07.001, attempts to import a registry configuration set from a <I>.rcf</I> file always fail </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app006.htm"><B>Note 6 : Searching And Replacing Within Macros</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>You may be finding difficulty creating macros to automate searching and replacing operations. This is because of a major deficiency in the macro language - the note explains the problems, and suggests a limited workround that you might be able to use. </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app007.htm"><B>Note 7 : UNIX File Format Is Lost After A Save As Operation</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>When you're working with files that are stored in UNIX format, you may find that the file changes back to DOS format after you perform a <B>File Save As</B> command. </P>

<P>The reason for this behaviour, and how the situation has been made better in release 0.07.002, are in this note. </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app008.htm"><B>Note 8 : External Spell Checkers Do Not Work With PFE</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>



<P>External spell-check programs will not be able to integrate with PFE. This note explains why. </P></DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app009.htm"><B>Note 9 : Monotype.com Font Not Usable By PFE</B></A> </LI></UL>

<DIR>

</DIR>





<UL>

<LI><A HREF="app011.htm"><B>Note 11 : Control Station Window Does Not Close Correctly </B></A></LI></UL>

<DIR>

<DIR>
