<H2>Exercise 1</H2>
Exercise 1 was to look at the web page for the course and to send email
to Dr. Vickery: vickery@qcunix1.qc.edu.  If you haven't done that yet,
do it now!

<H2>Exercise 2</H2>

This exercise is due by midnight, Tuesday February 10.<p>

If you attended Dr. Johnson's recitation on February 5 (odd-numbered ID
number), your assignment is to modify the applet from Figure 4.13 of
the text, which uses recursion to generate the Fibonacci value of an
integer.  Modify it so that it runs as an application.<p>

If you attended Dr. Vickery's recitation on February 5, your assignment
is to get a copy of the sample program covered in class
(<CODE>Power2.java</CODE>), write the <CODE>.html</CODE> file for that
applet, and to run it.<p>

In either case, your assignment is to email a message to Dr. Vickery
with the source code included as an attachment.  If you did the
Fibonacci assignment, attach just one file.  If you did the Power2
assignment, you have to attach two files (the <CODE>.java</CODE> and
the <CODE>.html</CODE> files).<p>

<H3>Notes</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>Be sure you have compiled and run the code that you mail to me.  I
  will be testing to be sure it works!
  <LI>I will <I>not</I> be looking at ID numbers when I grade this
  exercise, so if you prefer to do the one other than the one assigned
  to you, that's all right.
  <LI>You are expected to be able to do <I>both</I> exercises, but you
  must submit just <I>one</I> of them.

<H3>Pine, <I>ftp</I>, and all that stuff</H3>

If you use an off-campus email account and do your work for the course
on your own PC, that's all right, and this section doesn't apply to you.
You'll have to deal with email and attachments yourself.<p>

However, if you use your account on <I>qcunix1</I> for this course, read
on ...<p>

<B>How to transfer a file from PC to <I>qcunix1</I>:</B>  If you can log
into your qcunix1 account using telnet, that means that your PC and
qcunix1 can communicate using any TCP/IP (Internet) protocol, including
ftp, the file transfer protocol.  All PCs on campus can handle this. 
The problem is that Windows 95/NT provides only command-line access to
ftp.  From a DOS prompt type, "ftp qcunix1.qc.edu" and you should get a
login prompt.  Enter your qcunix1 account name and password, and you're
connected.  Use ftp's cd and dir commands to move around your qcunix1
directories, and use the put and get commands to transfer files to/from
qcunix1.  If you try to transfer non-text files (.class files or images)
you must first use ftp's bin command to do the transfer successfully. 
You'll get garbled data at the other end if you don't.  It's perfectly
all right to transfer text files in bin mode too, it's just
imperceptively slower.<p>

<B>How to attach files to email messages using Pine</B>:  With the
cursor in the header part of your message (where To: and Subject: are
displayed), type ^J and Pine will prompt you for the name of the file
you want to attach to your message.  You also get to write some
descriptive text.  As long as you use a descriptive name for the file
you attach, the descriptive text isn't really needed and you can type
anything you want there.  To attach a second file, just type ^J in the
header again and follow the same procedure.  Try sending yourself some
mail with attachments to see how it works.  When you receive your test
message, experiment with the "view" and "save" commands to look at your
attachments.  Follow the menus and prompts on the screen.<p>
