Here is pseudodode for the Puzzle constructor and findWord method,
as given in recitation on April 23.<p>

<H2>Constructor</H2>

<pre>
  public Puzzle( String fileName ) throws Exception {

    try {
      Create BufferedReader from the fileName. (Called br in this
      algorithm.)
      }
    catch (IOException e) {
      throw new Exception("cannot access puzzle file")
      }

    try {

      //  First line of the file tells the number of rows
      inBuf = br.readLine()
      if inBuf == null throw "empty puzzle file"
      numRows = Integer.parseInt(inBuf)
      if numRows is less than 1, throw "invalid number of rows"

      //  Second line of the file is the first row of the puzzle;
      //  remember how many characters it has.
      inBuf = br.readLine()
      if inBuf == null throw "invalid puzzle file"
      numCols = inBuf.length()

      convert inBuf to uppercase
      convert inBuf to an array of char in the first row of thePuzzle:
        thePuzzle[0] = new char[ inBuf.length() ];
        inBuf.getChars( 0, inBuf.length(), thePuzzle[0], 0 );


      //  Read remaining lines of the puzzle
      for rows 1 to the end
        inBuf = br.readLine()
        if inBuf == null throw "invalid puzzle file (too short)"
        if inBuf.length != numCols throw "wrong line length"
        convert inBuf to upper case
        convert inBuf to an array of char in this row of thePuzzle

      }
    catch IOException, throw "error reading puzzle file"
    catch NumberFormatException, throw "invalid number of rows"

    Now you could put in another loop to read the word list from the
    remaining lines of the file, but that is not required for this
    assignment.

  }
</pre>

<H2>findWord()</H2>
<pre>
  public Answer findWord( String targetWord ) {
  
    Convert targetWord to upper case
    Convert targetWord to an array of char, called targetChars in this
      algorithm.  Length of targetChars is called len in this algorithm.
    For each row, r, in the puzzle {
      For each column, c, in the row {
        If targetChars[0] != thePuzzle[r][c]
          continue  // try next column
        found = true // assume we will find a match
        For each direction, d, between 0 and 7 {
          If r + (len - 1) * deltaY[d] is not between 0 and numRows OR
             c + (len - 1) * deltaX[d] is not between 0 and numCols
             continue // try next direction
          For each char in targetChars {
            If targetChars[i] != thePuzzle[r + deltaY[d][c +deltaX[d]
              found = false
              break
            } // next char
          If found is still true, return new Answer(r, c, d)
          } // next direction
        } // next column
      } // next row

    Each row, column, and direction combination has been tested without
    finding a match, so return null            

  }
