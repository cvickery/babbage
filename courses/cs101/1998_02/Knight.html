<H2>Introduction</H2>

This project is an exercise in array manipulation, and is based on
Exercise 5.22 and 5.23 in the textbook, <I>Java How to Program</I> by
Deitel &amp; Deitel.<p>

The Knight's Tour problem is a standard one in the history of chess, and
is also a classic programming project for introductory computer science
students.  But, before you go search the Web for how to do it, read the
exercises in the book, read this web page, and work on it yourself. 
It's the only way to learn!<p>

Still, there is a very nice web page that let's you "play the game" at
<a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~tfiller/knight.htm">[this
site]</a>.  I encourage you to visit it to get a feeling for what makes
the problem interesting.  Be sure you know how a Knight moves on a
chessboard and what the object of the Knight's Tour problem is before
you visit the site, though.  It's not explained there.  (Read the
textbook.)<p>

For our project, you will build a user interface and constuct tours as
separate objects.  I will provide you with a class file for each
(<CODE>TourUI.class</CODE> for the user interface (UI) and
<CODE>Tour.class</CODE> for the tours).  First you will build your own
Tour class, which must work with my TourUI, then you will build your own
TourUI class, which must work with both your own Tour class and mine.<p>

<H2>Code I am supplying</H2>

The <a
href=
"ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/CS-101/KnightsTour_1/TourUI.class"><CODE>[TourUI.class]</CODE></a>
file that I am providing is an application that interacts with the user
through the command line.  It prompts the user to enter a number
between 1 and 64, which is the square a tour is to start on.  It then
prints the length of the tour obtained, and then 8 rows of numbers
showing the sequence of squares visited by the tour.<p>

Actually, that's only what <CODE>TourUI.class</CODE> appears to do.  It
does some of its work using the <a
href="ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/CS-101/KnightsTour_1/Tour.class"><CODE>[Tour.class]</CODE></a>
file that I am providing you.  The <CODE>Tour</CODE> class provides a
<I>constructor</I> and two methods:

<UL>

  <LI><CODE>Tour( int startSquare )</CODE> is a constructor for the 
      Tour class.  After the main() method in class TourUI gets the
      starting square number from the user, it creates a new Tour
      object, passing the starting square number as an argument, using
      a statement like:

<pre>
      Tour t = new Tour( firstSquare );
</pre>

      (A constructor looks just like a method, with two special features.
      (1) It is called whenever a new object of a class is created, and
      (2) it can receive arguments, but cannot return a value.)<p>

      The Tour constructor computes a tour using whatever algorithm it
      decides to use. In our case, it uses the heuristic algorithm
      described in the book.<p>

  <LI><CODE>int getLength()</CODE> is a method that returns the length
      of the tour (a value between 1 and 64).  After constructing a
      Tour, main() gets its length using a statement like:

<pre>
      int len = t.getLength();
</pre>

  <LI><CODE>void showTour()</CODE> is a method that displays the the
      sequence of squares visited on the chessboard.  In our case, it
      prints 8 rows of 8 numbers on System.out.

</UL>

<H2>Developing the Project</H2>

<OL>

    <LI>Put the two class files I supplied in a directory, and load the
    TourUI class into the Java Virtual Machine.  If you are using the
    JDK, the command would be "java TourUI".  You don't have to load the
    Tour class into the JVM; it will be loaded automatically when a Tour
    object is created.<p>
    Test the program to be sure it behaves as you expect it to.  Note
    that the columns of output line up nicely.  What happens if the
    user specifies 4 as the starting square?<p>
    
    <LI>Write your own TourUI.java that does the same thing as mine. 
    Do <I>not</I> provide a graphical user interface.  Do <I>not</I>
    make an applet out of it.  Just write it as a command-line
    application.  Be sure it works with my Tour.class file.<p>
    
    <B>Note:</B> In case you don't know how to read the number that the
    user types in, I wrote a [<a
    href="Sample_Code/ReadANum.java">sample program that you can
    study</a>] to see one way to do it.  Apparently this was not
    covered in all the recitation sections of CS-95 last semester.<p>

    <LI>Write your own Tour.java.  Do this in three substeps: (a)
    Provide a constructor that sets the tour length to the starting
    square number (this is stupid, but it verifies that you can pass a
    number to the constructor); have getLength() return what it thinks
    is the tour length, and have showTour() print "hello".  Test it to
    be sure it works.  (b) Set up an 8x8 array of integers initialized
    with a set of numbers you will recognize, and have showTour() print
    that when it is called.  Test it to be sure it works.  (c)  Now
    initialize that 8x8 array with all zeros, and have the constructor
    fill in the values with the sequence in which the squares are
    visited.  Make sure your Tour class works with my TourUI class as
    well as with your own.<p>

    At this point you have met the requirements for the project.  Save
    your work, and continue with the following optional steps, if you
    want to.

    <LI>Provide a graphical user interface for TourUI.  It can be either
    an applet or an application.  The starting square number can be
    entered in a text field, or if you already know about such things,
    you could draw a mini-chessboard and let the user click on the
    starting square.  The output still goes to System.out.
    
    <LI>Provide a graphical user interface for Tour.  When showTour() is
    called, it creates a picture of a chessboard with numbers in each
    square showing the sequence of visits.  The output goes in its own
    window, not the one built by TourUI.

    <LI>Implement the brute force algorithm described in the book.  Now
    there has to be a second Tour constructor.  This one receives no
    arguments, randomly picks a starting square, and picks moves
    randomly.  Modify TourUI to ask the user how many tours to run. 
    Call showTour() only if a complete tour is found, and keep track of
    how many tours of each length are found; print that array when all
    the tours have been created.

</OL>

<H2>Submit the Project</H2>

Send your TourUI.java and Tour.java source files to Dr. Vickery by
email when you are finished.  The project will be "on time" if your
email is dated before midnight on the due date, Febrary 26.  You may
submit the project as late as March 5, but will you will lose 5% of the
project grade for each day it is late.  The project will not be
accepted for credit after March 5.  You can get partial credit for a
non-working program.

<H2>Project Grading</H2>

Projects will be graded on the basis of program correctness [30%],
coding style (how well did you use the Java language) [30%], code
documentation [20%], and user interface design [20%].  You will get full
credit for the user interface design if it is as good as the user
interface I provided in TourUI.class.  Extra-credit work will be
noted, but I'm not sure how it will figure into your course average yet.

<H2>February 20 Addendum</H2>

You don't have to read this if you don't want to.<p>

I was thinking about the project after class last night, and I realized
that the design is flawed a bit in two ways.  First, the showTour()
method is not a good idea.  All input and output should be done by the
TourUI class.  For this project it doesn't make any difference, but if
we want to change to a graphical user interface, both TourUI and Tour
will have to be changed, and that is not a Good Thing.  Logically, only
TourUI should have to be changed to change the user interface. 
Secondly, every class of object in Java has a toString() method that
knows how to convert the object to some kind of printable
representation.  If a class doesn't define its own toString() method,
it inherits one from class Object, which prints the name of the class
and a number that identifies the instance to the Java Virtual Machine. 
By adding an appropriate toString() method to Tour (one that returns a
String object that can be printed to display the final chessboard) you
can get TourUI to show the results by changing:

<pre>
      t.showTour();
</pre>
to:
<pre>
      System.out.println( t.toString() );
</pre>

The Big Deal here is that since every Java object has a toString()
method either explicitly or by inheritance from class Object, you can
pass any object as a parameter to System.out.println(), and it will
print the String it gets back by calling that object's toString()
method.  So the statement I just showed you can be written as just:

<pre>
      System.out.println( t );
</pre>

This is way cool.<p>

So I modified my TourUI.java and Tour.java to work with this better
model of the project.  My new TourUI makes the call to
System.out.println(&nbsp;t&nbsp;) instead of to t.showTour(), and my
new Tour has a toString() method that returns a printable string
representing the chessboard at the end of the tour.  For backwards
compatibility, my new Tour class still has the showTour() method, but
it works by doing System.out.println(&nbsp;toString()&nbsp;).  You can
use my new Tour class with your TourUI as well as with my old TourUI,
but my new TourUI works only with my new Tour class.  If you want to
use my new class files for this project instead of the old ones, you
can get them here: <a
