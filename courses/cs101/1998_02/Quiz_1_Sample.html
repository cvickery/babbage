You will have to write a Java method for this quiz.  A sample question
would be:

<PRE>
    Write a Java method that receives a two-dimensional array of
    <I>int</I>, and returns the sum of all the numbers in the
    odd-numbered columns.

</PRE>

Here's another one:

<PRE>
    Write a Java method that returns <I>true</I> if a doubly-subscripted
    array is a square matrix.  (<I>i.e.</I>, if each row has the same
    number of colums as the number of rows in the array.)
