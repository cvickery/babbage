  <LI>Be able to answer questions similar to the first two from Exam 2.
      [ <A href="Sample_Code/Exam_2.zip">Click Here</A> ] to download a
      zip file with solutions to those questions.  Some of the topics on
      the final exam (listed below) repeat material that was covered
      earlier.<p>

  <LI>Know how to use the data structure classes <CODE>Vector</CODE>
      and <CODE>Hashtable</CODE>.

  <LI>Know how to create and use Enumerations.

  <LI>Know how to process command line arguments.
  
  <LI>Know how to read Strings from a text file or from the console.
  
  <LI>Know how to use <I>try</I>, <I>catch</I>, <I>throw</I>, and
      <I>throws</I>.

  <LI>Know how to use or extend class <CODE>Frame</CODE>.  Know how to
  set the title in a class that extends frame and that calling
  <I>super()</I> as the first statement in the constructor of a class
  that extends Frame call's the Frame constructor that sets the title
  for the Frame.

  <LI>Know how to create a List and how to add items to it.
  
  <LI>Know the three things you have to do to find out when a user
  interacts with a component (Write a class that implements the proper
  interface, write a callback method with the correct name and argument
  types in that class, and add that class as a listener for the types
  of event the component generates.)
  
  <LI>Know how to do those three things for class <CODE>List</CODE>. 
  (The class must implement the <CODE>ItemListener</CODE> interface, it
  must have a method named <I>itemStateChanged()</I> that receives an
  <CODE>ItemEvent</CODE> and returns nothing, and the List's
  <I>addItemListener()</I> must be passed a reference to an instance of
  the class that implements the <CODE>ItemListener</CODE> interface.)
  
  <LI>Know how to use <I>getStateChange()</I> and <I>getItem()</I>
  inside <I>itemStateChanged()</I>, and how to use the constants,
  <CODE>ItemEvent.SELECTED</CODE> and
  <CODE>ItemEvent.DESELECTED</CODE>.

  <LI>Know how to use <I>Integer.intValue()</I> and
      <I>Integer.parseInt()</I>.

  <LI>Know how to make the close window button (the 'x') work for class
  <CODE>Frame</CODE>.  (Implement <CODE>WindowListener</CODE>, provide
  method <I>WindowClosing()</I>, and call <I>addWindowListener()</I>. 
  This is not accurate because there are several other callback methods
  that have to be implemented, which we can handle with a class that
  extends class <CODE>WindowAdapter</CODE>, but what I said here is
  close enough for the exam.)

  <LI>Know how to draw lines and characters on a Canvas or Component
  using <I>drawLine()</I> and <I>drawChars()</I> in the object's
  <I>paint()</I> method.

  <LI>Know what a Layout Manager is.
  
  <LI>Know what <I>pack()</I> does.

  <LI>Know how to add components to a container managed by BorderLayout
  using constants like <CODE>BorderLayout.NORTH</CODE>.

  <LI>Know the difference between BorderLayout and FlowLayout.

  be specific questions "just to see if you read the book," but these
  sections cover topics listed in this Study Guide.
