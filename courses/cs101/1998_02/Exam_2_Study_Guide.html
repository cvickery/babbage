  <LI>Be able to read Strings from System.in.  Use BufferedReader and
  InputStreamReader.

  <LI>Be able to read Strings from a file.  Use BufferedReader and
  FileReader.

  <LI>Be able to do something with each of the Strings the user types on
  the java command line.

  <LI>Be able to use a <B>throws</B> clause for a method that does I/O
  but doesn't handle IOExceptions itself.

  <LI>Be able to use the String methods, <I>toLowerCase(),
  toUpperCase(), equals(), equalsIgnoreCase(), endsWith(),
  startsWith(),</I> and <I>toCharArray()</I>.

  <LI>Be able to use <I>Integer.parseInt()</I> to convert a String to
  an integer.

  <LI>Know the difference between a String and a StringBuffer.

  <LI>Be able to use the StringBuffer method, <I>append()</I>.

  <LI>Be able to construct a String from a StringBuffer.

  <LI>Be able to use <B>try</B> and <B>catch</B> to control what
  happens if <I>Integer.parseInt()</I> is given a String that it can't
  parse properly.

  <LI>Know that either throwing and Exception or calling a method that
  throws an Exception causes a try block to terminate "abruptly" -- no
  statements in the try block are executed after the exception happens.

  <LI>Be able to write a method that uses <B>throw</B> to indicate an
  exceptional condition.

  <LI>Know the difference between a Vector and an array.

  <LI>Be able to use the Vector methods, <I>addElement(), size(),</I>
  and <I>indexOf()</I>.

  <LI>Be able to convert variables of primitive data types into objects
  so they can be added to a Vector.

  <LI>Be able to use the Vector method, <I>elements()</I>, to create
  an Enumeration, and be able to use <I>hasMoreElements()</I> and
  <I>nextElement()</I> to go through the elements in that Enumeration.

  <LI>Be able to use <B>break</B> and <B>continue</B> to control loops.

  <LI>Know the difference between static and non-static variables and
  methods.

  <LI>Know what it means to "instantiate" a class.

  <LI>Know that running an application using the <I>java</I> command
  starts up a JVM (Java Virtual Machine), which loads the class into
  its memory and creates a thread that calls <I>main()</I>.

  <LI>Know that running an applet causes the applet context (the web
  browser)   to start up a JVM if it isn't running yet, to load the
  class into the JVM, to instantiate the class, and to call the new
  applet's <I>init()</I> method.

  <LI>Know that <I>init()</I>, <I>start()</I>, <I>paint()</I>, and
  <I>actionPerformed()</I> are examples of "callback methods," methods
  that are called when the user does something rather than when your
  own code calls them.
