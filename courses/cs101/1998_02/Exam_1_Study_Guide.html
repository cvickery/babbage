<UL>
</B><LI>Be able to write a method, like the ones on the quizzes.</LI>
<LI>Be able to name all the primitive data types.</LI>
<LI>Know the difference between a primitive data type variable and an object reference.</LI>
<LI>Know that arrays are objects.</LI>
<LI>Know how to declare an array variable, and how to actually create the array.</LI>
<LI>Know how to iterate over the elements of a doubly-subscripted array without assuming it is square.</LI>
<LI>Know what it means to specify just one subscript of a doubly-subscripted array.</LI>
<LI>Know the difference between a method definition and a method reference.</LI>
<LI>Know that every method definition must specify a return type and must contain a <I>return</I> statement.</LI>
<LI>Know what a <I>return</I> statement does, and that it must not specify a value if the method’s return type is void.</LI>
<LI>Know what a constructor is and when it is executed.</LI>
<LI>Know that constructors must not specify a return type, but that constructors may include return statements provided they do not give a value to return.</LI>
<LI>Know that constructors and void methods may contain zero or more return statements and that all other methods must contain one or more return statements.</LI>
<LI>Know what the <I>new</I> operator does.</LI>
<LI>Know the difference between a class and an object.</LI>
<LI>Know that a class definition may contain method definitions and/or data fields, and that data fields may be primitive types or object references.</LI>
<LI>Know that a class definition <I>encapsulates</I> methods and data fields so that other programs can use the class without needing to know it’s inner structure, and that this helps make the class reusable.</LI>
<LI>Know that the name of a public class must match the name of the .java file in which it is defined, but that a .java file may contain any number of non-public class definitions.</LI>
<LI>Know that compiling a .java file will generate a .class file for each class definition in the .java file, and the .class file names will match the names of the class definitions.</LI>
<LI>Know that appletviewer, web browsers, and the &quot;java&quot; command all create Java Virtual Machines. (JVMs)</LI>
<LI>Know that .class files (each containing the bytecode representation of one class definition) are loaded into the JVM on demand.</LI>
<LI>Know that once a class has been loaded into the JVM it can be <I>instantiated</I> any number of times.</LI>
<LI>Know that applets are instantiated by the browser or appletviewer, but that a class loaded as an application is not instantiated.</LI>
<LI>Know that you can reference <I>static</I> methods and data fields even if the class has not been instantiated, but non-static methods and data fields require an object instance to reference them.</LI>
<LI>Know that dot notation is used to get from an instance variable to the data fields and methods of object that it references.</LI>
<LI>Know that there are separate copies of all non-static data fields for each instance of a class.</LI>
<LI>Know that static data fields, static methods, and non-static methods are loaded into the JVM’s memory just once, when the class is loaded, regardless of how many times the class is instantiated.</LI>
<LI>Know that class definitions form a hierarchy, with class Object being the superclass of all other classes, either directly or indirectly.</LI>
<LI>Know that subclasses <I>inherit</I> the methods and data fields of their superclasses, promoting software reuse.</LI>
<LI>Know the difference between class composition (&quot;has a&quot;) and class inheritance (&quot;is a&quot;) relationships.</LI>
<LI>Know that a subclass uses the <I>extends</I> keyword to indicate its superclass’ name.  A class can extend no more than one superclass.  If there is no extends keyword, the class extends the Object superclass by default.</LI>
<LI>Know that a class cannot be instantiated if it is declared <I>abstract</I> (or any of its methods are declared abstract).  It has to be extended if it is going to be used.</LI>
<LI>Know that a class cannot be extended if it is declared to be <I>final</I>.</LI>
<LI>Know that an <I>interface</I> is a class that declares method signatures, but no definitions.  Any number of interfaces may be implemented by a class; use the <I>implements</I> keyword.</LI>
<LI>Know that a subclass can <I>override</I> a method or data field inherited from its superclass, and that this is an example of <I>polymorphism</I>.</LI>
<LI>Know that a method cannot be overridden if it is declared to be <I>final.</LI>
</I><LI>Know that polymorphism means that the same method can do different things, depending on what class it is a member of.</LI>
<LI>Know that two methods in a class definition may have the same name, provided they have different <I>signatures,</I> and that a method’s signature is its name plus the number and types of arguments it takes but not its return type.</LI>
<LI>Know that a method in a subclass can use <I>super</I> to invoke its superclass’ methods.</LI>
<LI>Know that a constructor can invoke one of its superclass’ constructors using <I>super(…)</I> as its first executable statement.  If there is no call to <I>super(…)</I>, the superclass’ default (&quot;no-arg&quot;) constructor is called instead.</LI>
<LI>Know that late binding means that the JVM figures out what method to call as the program runs rather than when the program is compiled.  This happens because a reference variable might point to objects of different classes, each of which has a method with the same name.</LI></UL>
