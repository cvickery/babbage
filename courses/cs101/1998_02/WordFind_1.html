<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Word Find Puzzle Project</H1>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

You are to write a set of Java classes that allow a user to work with
"Word Find" puzzles. A Word Find puzzle (hereafter known as a "Puzzle"
or as a "wfp") is a rectangular matrix of letters with words embedded
in it. The words may start anywhere, and may run in any of the eight
directions, North (up), Northeast (up and to the right), East (to the
right, Southeast, etc. As the puzzle is conventionally played, the
matrix is printed with each letter in a box, and a list of embedded
words is printed nearby. The player's task is to circle each of the
words in the matrix.<P>

For this project, the user will be given a set of text files, each of
which contains one puzzle and its word list. The user runs the program
from the command line by typing, "java UI <I>&lt;file&gt;</I> ...",
where <I>&lt;file&gt;</I> ... represents a list of the names of files
containing puzzles, separated by spaces. The user will then see the
first puzzle, and a prompt telling him/her to enter either a word to
find in the puzzle, or one of the following commands:<P>

<PRE>
      q -- exit the program
      n -- go to the next puzzle
      l -- list the words in the puzzle
      p -- print the puzzle again
</PRE>

If the user enters one of these commands, the program performs the
appropriate action, and repeats the prompt.  If the user enters
something other than one of these commands, it is interpreted as a word
to find in the current puzzle, and the program either displays the row
and column where the word starts along with the direction the word goes
in, or the message, "Not found."<P>

<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

The project is due on <B>April 30, 1998</B>.  Send me email with four
files attached: UI.java, Puzzle.java, Answer.java, and Direction.java. 
These files are described later on in this document.  The files must be
named as indicated, with the indicated spelling and capitalization, or
they will not be accepted for credit.  You may put all four files into
one zip file and attach that to your email message instead.  In fact, a
zip file is a little easier for me to work with than four separate
.java files.  Do not bother to send any .class files; I will compile
your code when I grade it.<P>

<H2>My Solution</H2>

You can run my solution for the project by downloading the files from [
<A HREF="ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/CS-101/WordFind_1">this
directory</A> ]. You will find some sample puzzle files there too,
including some that have errors in them for testing purposes. <P>

<H2>Puzzle Files</H2>

You, or your users, can make your own puzzle files. Use any text
editor, and prepare the file as follows: On the first line, type the
number of rows in the puzzle matrix. The next <I>n</I> lines (where
<I>n</I> is the number you typed on the first line) contain the rows of
the puzzle with no spaces between the letters. Each row must have
exactly the same number of characters as the first one. Immediately
after the puzzle lines comes the list of words in the puzzle, one per
line. The puzzle lines and the words may be entered in either upper or
lower case. Here is a sample puzzle file, with the puzzle lines using
upper case letters just to make it clearer where the puzzle ends and
the word list begins:<P>

<PRE>
        4
        ABCD
        EFOT
        GGMA
        XYLC
        dog
        cat

<H2>Classes You Are To Implement</H2>

<OL>

  <LI>Class <B><CODE>UI</B></CODE> provides the command line user
  interface for this project. Method <B><I>main()</B></I> implements the
  user interface. The next project will substitute a graphical user
  interface for the program, using an Applet instead of the command
  line.</LI>

  <LI>Class <B><CODE>Puzzle</B></CODE> provides one constructor, which
  takes a String as its only argument. The String is the name of a puzzle
  file. For this project, the name of the puzzle file will be one of the
  names typed on the java command line by the user. If the constructor is
  not able to build a puzzle successfully, it throws an Exception that
  includes an explanatory message. The UI class will print this message
  and must not try to use the Puzzle if an Exception is thrown by the
  constructor.<p>
  
  This class provides the following methods:<p>

  <UL>

    <LI><B><I>toString()</B></I> returns a String representing the
    puzzle matrix. </LI>

    <LI><B><I>getPuzzleName()</B></I> returns a String giving the name
    of the puzzle, which will be the name of the file that the puzzle
    came from. </LI>

    <LI><B><I>getNumberOfWords()</B></I> returns an <CODE>int</CODE>
    telling how many words were in the word list for the puzzle. </LI>

    <LI><B><I>getWordList()</B></I> returns a Vector of Strings; each
    String has one of the words in the word list for the puzzle. </LI>

    <LI><B><I>findWord()</B></I> receives one String argument (the word
    to find), and returns an Answer, or <CODE>null</CODE> if the word
    can't be found in the puzzle. </LI>

  </UL>


  <LI>Class <B><CODE>Answer</B></CODE> holds a row number, a column
  number, and a Direction. The constructor constructs the Answer from
  three <CODE>int</CODE>s. (The "proper" implementation of this class
  would use one of the constants provided by class Direction for the
  third argument, but that would require you to implement the
  Enumeration interface, which adds too much complexity to an
  already-complex project!) The <B><I>toString()</B></I> method returns
  a String indicating the row, column, and Direction.</LI>

  <LI>Class <B><CODE>Direction</B></CODE> stores one of 8 compass
  points as an <CODE>int</CODE>, with 0 representing North, 1 =
  Northeast, 2 = East, etc. The class provides public static final
  <CODE>int</CODE>s for the eight directions, with names N, NE, E, SE, S,
  etc. It also provides a public static final array of eight Strings,
  <B><CODE>stringName</B></CODE>, that has the String representation for
  each direction. Finally, this class also provides two public static
  final arrays of <CODE>int</CODE> named <B><CODE>deltaX</B></CODE> and
  <B><CODE>deltaY</B></CODE> that are analogous to the
  <CODE>horizontal</CODE> and <CODE>vertical</CODE> arrays from the
  Knight's Tour project.<p>

  This class provides one method, <B><I>toString()</B></I>, which returns
  the <CODE>stringName</CODE> for the direction.<p>

</OL>

<H2>Development Strategy</H2>

Start by downloading [ <A
HREF="ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/CS-101/WordFind_1">my class
files and sample puzzles.</A> ] Make sure you can run the program and
understand what it is doing.<P>

Next, write your own command line user interface
(<CODE>UI.java)</CODE>. This class must use the command line arguments
to determine the puzzle files to be constructed. Start by writing code
that just prints each argument the user types on the command line, then
add code that prompts the user to enter 'q' to exit or 'n' for the next
file. If the user types 'n' the program should display the next file
name, or should exit if there are no more file names. Once you have
this working, you can add the code to try constructing a Puzzle for
each file, and printing it. Just use valid puzzle files at first
(<CODE>puzzle_57</CODE> and <CODE>bingo</CODE>), then make sure your
code prints the message from any Exception that gets thrown by the
constructor.  During this step, you will use my class files for Puzzle,
Direction, and Answer.<P>

Now you can start work on <CODE>Puzzle.java</CODE>.  Start by working
on the Constructor.  You will have to provide "stub" versions of
<I>getPuzzleName()</I>, <I>getNumberOfWords()</I>,
<I>getWordList()</I>, and <I>findWord()</I> that do nothing but return
some value of the appropriate type.  You do not have to write a stub
for <I>toString()</I> because the class will inherit one.  Here are
examples of the code you could use for the stubs:<P>

<PRE>
     String getPuzzleName()       { return "Not Implemented yet"; }
     int    getNumberOfWords()    { return 0; }
     Vector getWordList()         { return new Vector(); }
     Answer findWord( String s )  { return null; }
</PRE>

You have to declare that your constructor might throw an Exception,
because that will be the mechanism for communicating any failure to create
a Puzzle back to the user interface class:<p>

<CODE>public Puzzle( String filename ) throws Exception { …</CODE>.<p>

There are six things that might cause your constructor to fail: (1) the
file might not exist or might not be readable, (2) the file might not
have a valid number in the first line, (3) there might not be a first
line(!), (4) there might be a puzzle row that doesn't have the right number
of characters in it, (5) there might not be enough lines in the
puzzle.  (The sixth condition doesn't apply to this project: the word
list at the end of the puzzle might contain words that can't be found in
the project.)<p>

Condition (1) will cause your attempt to access the file to
fail with an IOException.  Condition (2) will cause your reference to
Integer.parseInt() to fail with a NumberFormatException.  With all this
in mind, here is the algorithm you want to implement in your
constructor:<P>


<PRE>
   try {
    create a new BufferedReader (IOException)
    read first line of the file (IOException)
    call Integer.parseInt() to get the number of rows (NumberFormatException)
    read the second line of the file, which is the first row of the puzzle (IOException)
    save the length of this line as the number of columns in the puzzle
    convert the line from a string into an array of char using the getChar() method
      provided by the String class, and put the array in thePuzzle[0]
    for each additional row of the puzzle:
     read a line from the file
     if you get null instead of a String, the file did not contain enough lines, so throw
       a new Exception("put your message here")
     if the length of the string is not equal to the number of columns in the puzzle,
       throw a new Exception("put your message here")
     convert the string to an array of chars, and put it in thePuzzle[i]
     }
    catch ( IOException e ) { throw new Exception( "put your message here") }

    catch ( NumberFormatException e ) { throw new Exception( "put your message here") }
</PRE>

You have to substitute a meaningful message for all those "put your
message here" strings in the above algorithm.  The Exceptions that are
thrown by the system already have useful messages in them, which you
can retrieve using the <I>getMessage()</I> method of class
<CODE>Exception</CODE>.  Thus, for example, my IOException handler
looks like this:<p>

<CODE>{ throw new Exception( "Unable to read puzzle file " + e.getMessage() ); }
</CODE><p>

In this case, <I>e.getMessage()</I> gives the name of the file that
couldn't be read.<P>

I have written another summary of the constructor algorithm, as well as
the algorithm for the <I>findWord()</I> method, which you can see [
<a href="WordFind_1a.html">at this page</a> ].<P>
