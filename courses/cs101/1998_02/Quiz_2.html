<H2>Question</H2>
Write a method named <I>howTrue</I> that computes the percentage of
elements in a two-dimensional array of <I>boolean</I>.  The percentage is
returned as a <I>float</I>.  See <A
href="Lecture_Notes_5/sld016.htm">[the lecture notes]</a> for details.

<H2>Comments</H2>

All that was required was the method definition.  What you see above is
a complete .java file that illustrates how the method could be
called.<p>

For this illustration, the method has been declared <I>static</I>, but
that was not required for the Quiz.<p>

Note that the name of the file is <CODE>Quiz2.java</CODE>, but the name
of the class is <CODE>run</CODE>.  Why is that all right?  What is the
name of the .class file, and how do you run this application?<p>

<h2>More than you wanted to know about the <I>return</I> statement</H2>

The <I>return</I> statement is tricky.  You can't do integer arithmetic
because the fraction gets lost:

<pre>
          return 100 * numTrue / numElements; // returns no fraction
          return numTrue / numElements * 100; // returns zero
</pre>

You can use a cast to fix things up, but you have to be careful:

<pre>
          return (float) 100 * numTrue / numElements;   // ok
</pre>

This works, but perhaps not for the reason you think.  It forces "100"
to be a float.  Then since the expression involves a float, the two
integer variables are promoted to floats for doing the computation. 
Contrast that with this:

<pre>
          return (float) ( 100 * numTrue / numElements ); // no fraction
</pre>

That does the calculation using all integers, and then converts the
result to float.  Since the method has to return a float anyway, the
cast is redundant and doesn't solve the problem either.<p>

I mentioned to some people after class that the problem could be fixed
by changing the constant "100" to "100.".  The difference is that the
former is an integer, and the latter is a real.  But doing that
generated a syntax error!  The reason is that 100. is of type double,
not float.  So this doesn't work:

<pre>
          return 100. * numTrue / numElements;          // Syntax Error!
</pre>

Why?  Because the two integers are promoted to doubles to match the
100., and you can't implicitly "downcast" that result to a float for the
return value.  So, this works:

<pre>
          return (float) 100. * numTrue / numElements;  // ok
</pre>

The constant 100 is made into a float, then the integers are promoted to
floats, and the result is a float.  But this doesn't work:

<pre>
          return (float) numTrue / numElements * 100.;  // Syntax Error!
</pre>

Here, <CODE>numTrue</CODE> is promoted to a float, but 100. is still a
double, so numTrue is promoted again to a double (as well as
numElements), and the result of the expression is a double.<p>
