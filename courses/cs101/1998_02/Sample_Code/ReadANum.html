<H1>Read a Number from the Console</H1>
</center>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

  This is an application that reads an unsigned integer from the command
  line.  It's not very robust (for example "hello" and "-123" are both
  happily read as the value zero), but it gets the job done without
  having to wrap System.in in an InputStreamReader, which has to be
  wrapped in a StreamTokenizer, which has to be processed using member
  funcitons to get tokens and turn them into ints ...  Anyway, this code
  works and is pretty easy to understand.<p>
  
  If you want to download a copy of this code, you have several
  options, which depend on what browser and what compter system you are
  using. One way is to tell your browser to save this page to disk, and
  edit out the parts that aren't Java.  Another way is to [<A
  href="ftp://babbage.cs.qc.edu/pub/vickery/CS-101/ReadANum.java">
  click on this link</a> ], which will use the ftp protocol to get a
  copy.  Depending on your system, this option will either load the
  file into a browser window (and you can then save it to disk) or
  transfer the file directly to your disk.  The problem is that text
  files are stored with a linefeed character at the end of each line on
  Unix computers (like babbage), but with carriage return and linefeed
  characters at the end of each line on Microsoft operating systems,
  and with only carriage returns on Macintosh systems. Some browsers
  deal with this problem better than others, and some ftp programs do
  better than some browsers.

     //    This application illustrates how to read a numeric string from
     //    the command line and convert it to an int.

     /**
      *    This is a "wrapper" class for a main() method that reads
      *    characters from the command line, and converts them to an
      *    int.

     public class ReadANum {

       /**
        *    There are better ways than this to do the conversion of intput
        *    characters into a number in Java.  For example, one limitation
        *    of this code is that it handles only positive integers, or
        *    zero, and treats anything that doesn't start with a digit as
        *    the value zero.
        *
        *    What follows is fairly detailed commentary about this method;
        *    you would never write comments like these because you can
        *    always assume the reader of your code already knows about
        *    Java's built-in classes, like Character.
        *
        *      System.in.read() returns the integer value of the Unicode
        *      representation of one character typed by the user.  This int
        *      can be saved in a char by using a cast; casts tell the
        *      compiler we know what we are doing (or at least think we do);
        *      without the cast, the compiler thinks that assigning an int
        *      to a char is a syntax error.
        *
        *      The built-in class Character has a method called isDigit()
        *      which takes a char as an argument, and will tell if the char
        *      is a valid decimal digit or not by returning a boolean
        *      value.  So the while loop reads input characters until it
        *      gets one that is not a valid decimal digit.
        *
        *      The int, "value," is initialzed to zero, and is scaled up by
        *      factor of 10 for every decimal digit that is read, and
        *      incremented by the numeric value of the character, which is
        *      obtained using the digit() method of class Character.  This
        *      method has to be told what radix to use, which is 10
        *      (decimal) in our case.  Try printing value each time through
        *      the loop to see how this works.
