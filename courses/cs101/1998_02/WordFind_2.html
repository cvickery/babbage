<P>Introduction</P>

</B></I></FONT><P>There is not enough time left in the term for you to
complete this project, but you can receive partial credit provided you
submit code that compiles and runs, even if it doesn't do much. That
means you must develop your program incrementally. Do a little bit, and
test to make sure it works. Add a little more, and test that, etc. This
is a good development strategy in general, because the difficulty of
debugging a program seems to grow in proportion to the square of the
number of lines of code being debugged. The fewer lines you add at a
time, the fewer lines you have to consider at a time.</P>

<P>This document tells how to develop this project systematically by
taking advantage that you can use my implementations of parts of the
project while you are developing another part.  Unless you talk to me
<I>beforehand</I> about doing your project differently (perhaps you have
an idea for a more interesting user interface), you are to do the
project following the development steps outlined here.</P>

<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Design Goals</P> </B></I></FONT>

<P>The primary goals of this project are to provide a GUI for the
WordFind project that can do the following things:</P> 

<UL>

<LI>Display a Puzzle matrix graphically. </LI>

<LI>Display the word list associated with a puzzle graphically. </LI>

<LI>Allow the user to select words from the word list, and see them
highlighted in the puzzle matrix.</LI>

</UL>

<P>Secondary goals could include:</P>

<UL>

<LI>Allow the user to click on words in the puzzle matrix and see them
highlighted in the word list.</LI>

<LI>Be able to run the program as an Applet. </LI>

<LI>Allow the user to type words not on the word list to see if they
appear in the puzzle.</LI></UL>

<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Code I am Supplying</P></B></I></FONT>

<P>I am supplying source code for the solution to the previous
assignment, parts of which are needed for doing this project, as well
as working versions of the classes that you are assigned to write for
this project.  [ <A href="Sample_Code/WordFind_GUI.zip"> Click Here</A>
] to download a zipped copy of these files.  <B>May 20:</B> [ <A
href="Sample_Code/WordFind_GUI_adjusts.zip"> Click Here</A> ] to
download an updated copy in which the P_Canvas adjusts its size based
on the size of your screen.  If you have had trouble seeing complete
puzzles on you screen, let me know if this works better or worse for
you.</P>

<UL>

<LI><B>Puzzle.java</B> <I>Note:</I> This class creates the word list
associated with the puzzle as well as the puzzle matrix itself, so it
is a superset of what was required for Project 3. It also has a new
method, <I>getPuzzle()</I> that returns a char[][] with the puzzle
matrix in it, which will be needed for this project. </LI>

<LI><B>Answer.java</B> The same as the file I distributed with Project
3.</LI>

<LI><B>Direction.java</B> <I>Note:</I> This class has a new method,
<I>intValue()</I>, which will be needed for this project. </LI>

<LI><B>WL.java</B> A WindowListener that makes windows disappear from
the screen when the user closes them. My WF_Frame class uses this class
so the user can make individual puzzles disappear from the screen.</LI>

<LI><B>GUI.class</B> My version of the "GUI Generator" application
class. </LI>

<LI><B>WF_Frame.class</B> The container for the GUI components (the
puzzle matrix and the word list).</LI>

<LI><B>P_Canvas.class</B> The class that knows how to draw a matrix of

<LI><B>UI.java</B> My User Interface class from Project 3.  Not needed
for this project, but here for you to look at if you want to.

</UL>

<P>My program implements all the primary design goals, but none of the
secondary ones.  <B>May 15 Addendum:</B>  The Zip file now includes HTML
files for [ <A href="Sample_Code/WordFind_GUI/bingo.html">bingo</A> ]
and [ <A href="Sample_Code/WordFind_GUI/puzzle_57.html">puzzle_57</A> ]
that can be used for Applet implementations.  The Puzzle class now
includes a constructor that takes an Applet reference as an argument,
and I provided a new class, AGUI ("Applet GUI") that uses this
constructor.  </P>

<B><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>Development Steps</P></I>

<OL>

</FONT><LI>Write your own <CODE>GUI.java</CODE>.</LI> </B>

<P>For each command line argument, create a Puzzle (if possible) and
construct a new WF_Frame for displaying and interacting with the
puzzle. The two arguments to the WF_Frame constructor are a String,
which will be put in the title bar of the Frame's window, and a
reference to the Puzzle object for that Frame. If there is an error
creating a Puzzle, write a message to System.err, and go on to the next
Puzzle file (if there are any more). Your program must not exit after
creating all the Puzzles and their Frames, or the user will never get a
chance to interact with them! My GUI puts up a window with a "Quit"
button, but yours should write a prompt message to System.out telling
the user to
"Press&nbsp;&lt;Enter&gt;&nbsp;when&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;ready&nbsp;to&nbsp;exit."
Then read from System.in, and exit when the user types something.</P>

<P>You can position a WF_Frame on the user's screen by calling
<I>setLocation().</I> Pass the x and y screen coordinates to this
method; you have to use a reference to the object to call it. This
feature is not required.</P>

<P>You can add a dialog box like (or better than) mine after you have
met the primary goals for the project.</P>

<P>Comment your code so that there is an "@author" tag somewhere in the
comments. Put your name after the tag, but don't put anything else on
the same line. There must be a block of comments before each class and
method definition. See my source code for examples.</P>

<I><P>Completing this step (without the dialog box) successfully will
be worth at least 4 out of 10 points for this project.</P> </I>

<B><LI>Write your own <CODE>WF_Frame.java</CODE>.</LI> </B>

<P>The class WF_Frame is to be a subclass of Frame, and the constructor
has to start with a call to the superclass' constructor with the title
string as the argument. You need to add two components to the Frame,
one is a Canvas that will display the puzzle matrix, and the other is a
List that will display the word list for the puzzle. Do this in two
sub-steps:</P>

<P>First, create a new List object. The constructor
takes two arguments, and <I>int</I> that tells the number of items to
display in the list, and a <I>boolean</I> that tells whether multiple
items in the List can be selected at the same time. For my code, I made
the number of items to display the minimum of six or the number of
items in the Puzzle's word list. Remember, the Puzzle is passed as an
argument to the constructor, a Vector containing the word list can be
obtained by calling Puzzle's <I>getWordList()</I> method, and the size
of the list can be obtained using Vector's <I>size()</I> method. Once
you have created the List, you need to populate it with the words from
the word list, using an Enumeration as shown in class on May 12. Now,
use <I>add()</I> to add the List to the WF_Frame, and call
<I>pack(),</I> and <I>show()</I> before returning from the constructor.
(There is no need for the <I>init()</I> method shown in class on May
12.)</P> 

<P>When you add a component to a container (<I>i.e.</I>, when
you add your List to your WF_Frame), you need to tell the "layout
manager" where to put the component. Applets use a FlowLayout layout
manager by default, but other containers, such as Frames, use a
BorderLayout layout manager by default. You can change layout managers,
or even have containers with no layout manager, but for this project we
will just use the default BorderLayout. When you call <I>add()</I>, the
first argument is a reference to the component being added, and the
second tells the layout manager where the component goes. For
BorderLayout the second argument can be one of the constants defined in
the BorderLayout class: <CODE>BorderLayout.NORTH</CODE>,
<CODE>BorderLayout.SOUTH</CODE>, <CODE>BorderLayout.EAST</CODE>,
<CODE>BorderLayout.WEST</CODE>, or <CODE>BorderLayout.CENTER</CODE>.
Once you have added your components to a container, calling
<I>pack()</I> (receives no arguments, returns nothing) tells the layout
manager to figure out where all the components go and how big to make
the container. Then, calling <I>show()</I> (receives no arguments,
returns nothing) makes the container visible on the screen.</P>
<I>

<P>Completing this much of the project correctly is worthat least 6
points out of 10 for the project.</P> </I>

<P>Next, you need to draw the Puzzle matrix in the WF_Frame. You could
define a <I>paint()</I> method for the WF_Frame class and do the
drawing directly into the Frame, but then the layout manager would not
know about it and it would get covered by the List component. Instead,
you need to create another component, add it to the WF_Frame, and have
that other component do the drawing using its own <I>paint()</I>
method. (WF_Frame does not need a <I>paint() </I>method at all.) The
traditional type of component to use for drawing things was called a
"Canvas," but the current Java AWT recommends the use of its
superclass, called "Component." The distinction makes no difference at
this point; P_Canvas is the name of the class that provides this
feature for this project. The P_Canvas constructor receives a
<I>char[][]</I> and draws the characters in that matrix into boxes to
be displayed in the Frame. You can get the matrix containing the
character array for a Puzzle by calling its <I>getPuzzle()</I> method.
This is a new method that I added to the Puzzle class for the purposes
of this project.</P> 

<P>When you add the P_Canvas to the WF_Frame, you need to tell the
layout manager where it goes. For example, in my code, I used
<CODE>BorderLayout.NORTH</CODE> for the P_Canvas and
<CODE>BorderLayout.CENTER</CODE> for the List. You can experiment with
different values and decide how you want your own to look, provided
both components are visible when the WF_Frame is shown!</P> <I>

<P>Completing this much of the project correctly is worth at least 8
points out of 10 for the project.</P> </I>

<B><LI>Respond to user interactions in the word list.</LI> </B>

<P>Declare the WF_Frame class to implement the ItemListener interface,
and add a method named <I>itemStateChanged()</I> to the class. This
method receives and ItemEvent object and returns nothing. It will be
called every time the user selects or deselects a word in the List
component. To activate this feature, you need to call List's
<I>addItemListener()</I> method with "this" as its argument after the
constructor creates the List object.</P> 

<P>To implement this part of the project, you need to know about two
methods provided by class ItemEvent, <I>getItem()</I>, and
<I>getStateChange().</I> Method <I>getItem()</I> returns the index of
the word that was selected or unselected as an Integer object. You have
to convert this object to an <I>int</I> (use <I>Integer.intValue()</I>)
and use this index to access the Puzzle's word list Vector (using
Vector's <I>elementAt()</I> method) to get the String containing the
word the user clicked on. Then you can use Puzzle's <I>findWord()</I>
method to determine the location of the word in the Puzzle, and
highlight the letters of the word.</P> 

<P>The <I>getStateChange()</I> method returns
<CODE>ItemEvent.SELECTED</CODE> if the user selected the word, or
<CODE>ItemEvent.DESELECTED</CODE> if the user deselected the word. You
can decide whether to highlight the word or to unhighlight it in the
P_Canvas depending on the value returned by this method.</P> 

<P>The P_Canvas class provides two methods for highlighting and
unhighlighting words it displays, named <I>highlight()</I> and
<I>unhighlight().</I> Both take four <I>int</I>s, the starting row and
column and the ending row and column, using (0, 0) to indicate the
upper left corner of the puzzle.</P>

<P>There is a messy implementation issue to deal with in order to get
this step "right."  It is that you will get "extra" calls to
<I>itemStateChanged()</I> if the user clicks rapidly or scrolls through
the List using the arrow keys.  My <I>highlight()</I> and
<I>unhighlight()</I> methods will not work correctly if they are called
to highlight an already highlighted word or to unhighlight an
unhighlighted word, so you need to filter out redundant state changes
as described in class on May 19 [ <A HREF="Lecture_Notes_13"> Lecture
Notes 13</A> ].

<I><P>Completing this much of the project correctly is worth at least
9.5 out of 10 points for the project.</P> </I>

<B><LI>Write your own <CODE>P_Canvas.java</CODE>.</LI> </B>

<P>The constructor must receive a <I>char[][]</I> and make the size of
the component proportional to the size of this matrix. If your class
extends class Canvas, use <I>setSize()</I> to give the width and
height, in pixels, respectively. If your class extends Component
instead, provide a method named <I>getPreferredSize()</I> that returns
a Dimension object constructed from the width and height instead.</P>

<p>To determine the size of the component correctly, you need to decide
what Font you are going to use for the characters, which in turn can be
used to create a FontMetrics object that tells you the height and width
of the characters that are displayed in that font. As a first
approximation, you can just use the default font for the system and
draw grid boxes that are 25x25 pixels in size.  This is not going to
work well on all computers, and the default Font has varying-width
characters ('W' is very wide, and 'I' is very narrow) which will lead
to letters not being centered in their grid boxes, but it is OK for
getting started.</p>

<p>In P_Canvas' <I>paint()</I> method, you can use Graphics'
<I>drawLine()</I> and <I>drawChars()</I> methods to draw the grid and
the letters, respectively. You can use <I>setColor()</I> to change the
color of what you draw for highlighting.</P>

<p>Implementing the highlighting routines involves solving some classic
problems in basic computer graphics.  The first is to figure out what
squares to highlight based on the cell positions of the letters at the
two ends of the word.   This is the same problem as figuring out what
pixels to light up in order to draw a line on the screen, but simplified
because the "lines" in this case can have only four possible slopes.
(There are 8 directions words can go in, but whether a word goes NE or
SW, the letters are on a line with a slope of +1, etc.)</P>

<p>The algorithm used for drawing lines is called the <I>Digital
Differential Analyzer</I>, or DDA.  We can use a simplified version of
the DDA (because of our limited number of slopes) as follows:  Compute Delta
X (C2 minus C1).  If Delta X is not zero, set Delta Y to +1 if R2 is
greater than R1, or to -1 if R2 is less than R1.  If delta X is negative,
swap C1 with C2, set R1 to R2, and reverse the sign of Delta Y.  At this
point, you can loop through columns C1 up to C2, with the row number
starting at R1 and incrementing by DeltaY each time through the
loop.  If, however, Delta X is zero, that means the word is vertical,
and you have to do this: Make sure R1 is less than R2 (swap endpoints if
necessary), then loop from R1 to R2 adding +1 or -1 to the column number
as necessary.  The verbal description of this is more complicated than
the actual code to implement it.</P>

<P>The other graphics issue is that the highlighting routines need to
deal with what happens when two words cross or overlap so that they
share one or more letters.  If both words are highlighted, and then one is
unhighlighted, the letters it shares with the other one should be left
highlighted until the second word is unhighlighted.  To manage this, I
used a matrix of <I>int</I>s telling how many times each letter is
highlighted (its "highlight count").  The <I>highlight()</I> method
adds one to each letter's position in this matrix, and the
<I>unhighlight()</I> method subtracts one.  When P_Canvas'
<I>paint()</I> method is called, it highlights letters whose highlight
count is greater than zero and unhighlights letters with a highlight count
equal to zero.</P>

<I> <P>Completing this much of the project correctly makes you eligible
for a "10" on the project.</P> </I>
