<H2>Packages</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>A <I>package</I> is a collection of classes (types) and,
      possibly, subpackages.<BR>
      <CODE>java</CODE> is a package that contains the subpackage
      <CODE>java.lang</CODE>.<BR>
      <CODE>java.lang</CODE> contains about 50 classes and several subpackages.
  <LI>A package hierarchy corresponds to a file system hierarchy on
  disk.  In Windows, substitute '\' for '.' in the package name.
  <LI>You can name the package that the classes in a compilation unit
  belong to using the <CODE>package</CODE> statement at the beginning of
  the file.
  <LI>Use <CODE>import</CODE> statements to name classes whose members
  you want to reference without having to specify the fully-qualified
  member name.
  <LI>All the compilation units in the same directory are part of the
  same unnamed package unless you use a <CODE>package</CODE> statement
  in some (or all) of them.
</UL>

<H2>Permissions</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>A <I>public</I> class or member can be referenced outside its
  package.
  <LI>A <I>protected</I> class or member can be referenced only inside
  its own class or from within a subclass.
  <LI>A <I>private</I> class or member can be referenced only from
  inside the class that it is defined in.
</UL>
