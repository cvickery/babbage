This page is a resource guide for tools you will need to use on a PC in
order to do CS-101 projects.<P>

The page includes links to the software tools for downloading.<P>

<H1><A name="jdk">Java Software Development Kit</A></H1>

[ <A href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.3/">Download from Sun</A>
] Be sure you get both the Software and the Documentation.<BR>

<H2>Setting Up the JDK</H2>

The JDK will download as a file named <CODE>j2sdk1_3_0-win.exe</CODE>,
which you should save in some folder on your disk. I use
<CODE>C:\Download</CODE> for this sort of thing because it is
compatible with <B>WinZip</B>'s &quot;Internet Extension&quot;
software. (See the section on <A href="#winzip"><B>WinZip</B></A> later
on this page for more information about this). Run this file (double
click on it from Explorer, or type its name in the box that comes up if
you click on Start-&gt;Run...), then follow the instructions that come
up for picking where to install the software. The default is
<CODE>C:\JDK1.3</CODE> but you can put it someplace else if you prefer.
You will get a directory tree that looks like the following:

<PRE>
      JDK1.3
        bin
        demo
        include
        jre
        lib
</PRE>

Now you need to install the documentation, which will download as a file
named <CODE>j2sdk1_3_0-doc.zip</CODE>. (Again, you should save it in
your <CODE>Download</CODE> directory.) You need to <I>unzip</I> this
file and then <I>extract</I> the documentation files that are in it. To
do this, you need a tool such as <B>WinZip</B>. If you don't have this
program (or something equivalent) installed on your computer, you have
to download and install <I>it</I> before installing the Java
documentation. How to get that is described [ <A href="#winzip">later in
this web page</A> ].<P>

When you run WinZip on <CODE>j2sdk1_3_0-doc.zip</CODE> and click on the
&quot;Extract&quot; button, you will be asked where to extract the
files. The proper place is one directory (folder) <I>above</I> your
JDK1.3 folder. So, if you installed the software in the standard place
(<CODE>C:\JDK1.3</CODE>), you would tell WinZip to extract the
documentation files to <CODE>C:\</CODE>. The result will be a new
directory <I>under</I> <CODE>JDK1.3</CODE>, which will be named
<CODE>docs</CODE>. So, your directory tree will now look like this:

<PRE>
      JDK1.3
        bin
        demo
        docs
        include
        jre
        lib
</PRE>

You have to get this directory tree set up right in order to be able to
use the documentation. To check this out, use your web browser to open
<CODE>JDK1.3\docs\index.html</CODE> (In <I>Netscape Navagator</I> use
the menus File-&gt;Open Page/Choose File...; In <I>Internet
Explorer</I>, use the menus File-&gt;Open/Browse...).&nbsp; Or you can
just type <CODE>C:\jdk1.3\docs\index.html</CODE> as your web
address.<P>

Scroll down the page and click on the link to &quot;Java 2 Platform API
Specification&quot; and save that page as a bookmark so you can get
back to it easily. It may take some time for you to get comfortable
with navigating through the API documentation, but it will be
invaluable once you get it, and it's a lot cheaper than the big
reference books from Addison-Wesley! (But it doesn't have all the great
explanations and sample code found in the A-W books either.)<P>

Use your browser's <I>Back</I> button to get to
<CODE>JDK1.3\docs\index.html</CODE> again, and scroll down to the link
to &quot;Tool Documentation&quot; under the <B>SDK Tool
Documentation</B> heading. This link will get you to documentation on
the <I>javac, java, appletviewer,</I> and <I>javadoc</I> commands,
among others.<P>

There is also a copy of the JDK documentation set up for browsing from
the computer in my office. You can use [ <A
href="#">this link</A>
] to access it.

<H2>Running the JDK Tools</H2>

You can run the compiler (<I>javac</I>) either from the command line or
from within some editors (see below). You will have to run your
applications from the command line, and you can run applets from either
the command line (using <I>appletviewer</I>) or from your web browser.
To get a command line processor (&quot;DOS Prompt&quot;) running, you
have to select the &quot;Command Prompt&quot; program from the Windows
Start menu.<P>

To run a JDK command, you should be able to type the name of the
command at the command line. Try typing just &quot;javac&quot; at the
<CODE>C:&gt;</CODE> prompt. If the command runs (and prints a message
that starts &quot;<CODE>Usage: ...</CODE>&quot;) you're all set. But if
you get a &quot;command not found message&quot; you need either to type
the full pathname of the command (such as
&quot;C:\JDK1.3\bin\javac&quot;) or add the pathname of the JDK's
<I>bin</I> directory to your PATH environment variable. Your
<CODE>PATH</CODE> environment variable should have been set up properly
(normally by putting a command in your <CODE>autoexec.bat</CODE> file)
when you installed the JDK. You could do this yourself, if necessary,
by typing the following command:

<PRE> set PATH=C:\JDK1.3\bin;%PATH% </PRE>

This command prepends the pathname to your JDK bin directory to the
current setting of your PATH environment variable. You could type this
command by hand every time you start a new DOS prompt window, but life
is a lot easier if you put this command at the end of your autoexec.bat
file so it is automatically run each time you start your computer.<P>

You may have heard about an environment variable named
<CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE> that needs to be set properly in order to use
the JDK commands, but in fact it does <I>not</I> need to be set, in
general. If it is set, it should have a value that looks like
&quot;<CODE>.;C:\JDK1.3\bin</CODE>&quot;. You can check this by typing
&quot;set CLASSPATH&quot; at the command line. If CLASSPATH has a
different value <I>and</I> you have trouble running the JDK commands,
you can get rid of it by typing &quot;<I>set CLASSPATH=</I>&quot;.
(Note that the first <I>set</I> command has no equal sign, and shows
the value of the variable, whereas the second one has an equal sign at
the end, and assigns an empty value to CLASSPATH, effectively
&quot;unsetting&quot; it. The current version of the JDK does not
require you to have a value for CLASSPATH.<P>

You may already have an Integrate Development Environment (IDE) for
Java installed on your computer (VisualAge, Cafe, JBuilder, Visual
Studio, ...), in which case there may be a value set for
<CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE>. As long as the command-line tools work
correctly, there is no need to worry about
<CODE>CLASSPATH</CODE>.

<a NAME="editors"><H1>Text Editors</H1></A>

<H2>As of January 2001, I suggest that you ignore the remainder of this
section and use <I>vim</I> as your text editor.  It is already
installed on Unix systems, including forbin.qc.edu, and you can get the
version for Windows for free from [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://www.vim.org">www.vim.org</A>&nbsp;].</H2>

There are three text editors that I recommend for you to use in place
of <I>Notepad</I>, which comes free with Windows. Each of them has the
two features I consider critical for a program editor, and one
highly-desireable one:

<OL>

  <LI>You can set the editor up so that it will substitute spaces for
    <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> characters, and you can set the tab
    settings to a &quot;reasonable&quot; value. (I use a tab width of 2
    characters, but 3 and even 4 are also reasonable values. If you use
    anything larger, using <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> to indent your code
    will make it go too far to the right, leading to wrapped lines that
    are impossible to read.)

    <BLOCKQUOTE>

      It is very important to substitute spaces for
      <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> characters in your programs because
      different software treats <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> characters
      differently. For example, if you have your tab width set to 2
      when you edit your program, and somebody prints or views it with
      software that assumes a default value of 8 (which is typical),
      they will find your code impossibly difficult to read because
      nothing will line up right.

    </BLOCKQUOTE>

  <LI>The editor does &quot;pair matching.&quot; This means that if you
    put the cursor on a brace and press a certain key (typically,
    <CODE>Control-B</CODE>), the editor will show you the matching
    brace character in the file, either by highlighting the characters
    in between the matching pair of braces or by jumping the cursor to
    the matching brace. Pair matching also works for parentheses and
    square brackets. Good indenting habits can reduce the need for this
    feature, but we all need it once in a while, and not having it can
    be a real bother.

  <LI>The &quot;highly-desireable feature&quot; that all these editors
    have is automatic indentation. This means (1) making each line
    indent the same number of spaces as the one immediately above it
    and (2) increasing/decreasing the indent amount when you end a line
    with a left/right curly brace. This is a useful feature, but not as
    critical as the other two because you can take care of this
    manually.

</OL>

<H2><A name="pfe">Programmer's File Editor</A> (Free)</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <I>Note: </I>PFE is no longer being developed or maintained by its
  author, but the final version is still available, and it's free.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

[ <A href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/people/cpaap/pfe/">Download from
Lancaster University (United Kingdom).</A> ]<BR>
[ <A href="#">Download
from my server at Queens College</A> ]<P>

The price is right for this one, and the set of available features is
very good. However, it does not support <I>syntax highlighting</I>,
which shows program keywords, variable names, comments, and constants in
different colors. Syntax highlighting is nice, but what do you want for
free? You can set this editor up to work very well for you.<P>

Installation is not automatic. The program will download as a .zip
file, which you will probably save in your <CODE>\Download</CODE>
directory. Extract the contents to any directory you wish using WinZip.
(See [ <A href="#winzip">WinZip</A> ] if you don't already have Winzip
or something equivalent on your computer.) I used <CODE>C:\Program
Files\PFE</CODE> as the directory to extract the files to, for example.
(You have to create the directory before doing the extraction, but
Winzip has a button to create it for you in the <I>Extract</I>
dialog.)<P>

You might want to drag the icon for the program to your desktop, add
the program to your Start menu, and/or create a keyboard shortcut for
the program to make it easy to get at. To do this, use Windows Explorer
to drag the icon for the program to your Desktop and/or Start Menu
folder, which will create a shortcut icon. If you right-click on the
shortcut, you will get a menu with <I>Properties</I> listed at the
bottom; click on that, select the <I>Shortcut</I> tab in the dialog box
that comes up, and type in the letter you want to use to start the
program in the &quot;Shortcut Key&quot; box.<P>

<H3>Customizing Programmer's File Editor</H3>

<OL>

  <LI><B>Create a Project Directory</B><P>

    You should make a directory for doing your projects in this course
    (and you will probably want a subdirectory for each project). You
    can use Windows Explorer to create your project directory by
    selecting the parent directory (perhaps <CODE>C:\</CODE>) and using
    File-&gt;New-&gt;Folder to create the new directory. It will be
    highlighted so you can easily rename it (perhaps to &quot;<CODE>CS-101
    Projects</CODE>&quot;).<P>

    &nbsp;

  <LI><B>Set up Defaults for Java Programs</B><P>

    Use the Options-&gt;Default Modes menus to bring up the Default
    Modes dialog box. Click on Edit Mode Groups, then click on New...,
    and enter something meaningful, like <I>Java Source Code</I> in the
    Mode Group Name box, and <CODE>*.java</CODE> in the Filename
    Patterns box. Click OK twice to get back to the Default Modes
    dialog. Click on Edit Modes... in the lower left corner of this
    dialog. Select Mody type &quot;input&quot; and check the
    &quot;Auto-indent new lines&quot; and &quot;Strip trailing
    spaces...&quot; boxes. Select the &quot;Language Awareness&quot;
    Mode type and choose &quot;C&quot;. Go down to the &quot;Text
    Formatting&quot; Mode type, and click the &quot;Tab with space
    characters&quot; radio button, and change the Tab stop box from 8
    to 2 (or 3 or 4, as you prefer). Check the Enabled box in the Text
    wrapping section, leaving the column number at 72 so that you will
    know when you type lines that are too wide. (You might not like the
    text wrapping option, in which case, leave the box unchecked; just
    don't hand in any code with any lines wider than 72 characters for
    this course.) Click OK to get out of the Edit Default Modes dialog
    box, and click Close in the Default Modes dialog box. <I>Wait!</I>
    Before you close the Default Modes dialog box, you might want to
    edit the default modes for windows showing templates, windows
    showing macros, and windows created by file new in the same ways as
    for Java Source Files.<P>

    Use the <I>Options-&gt;Preferences-&gt;Editing&nbsp;Files</I> menus
    to select other options you might want to set. In particular, you
    should turn on the Use Smart Tabbing checkbox here. With this option
    on, if you select a block of text and press the <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE>
    (or <CODE>Shift-&lt;tab&gt;</CODE>) key, the code will be indented
    (or unindented) one tab stop.<P>

  <LI><B>Other Features</B><P>

    When you are editing your code, you can put the cursor to the left
    of a brace, square bracket, or parentheses, and type
    <CODE>&lt;Control-B&gt;</CODE>; the editor will move the cursor to
    the matching symbol in the file, if there is one. Press
    <CODE>&lt;Control-B&gt;</CODE> again to jump back to where you
    started.<P>

    You might want to look into the editor's template and macro
    features. You can set up a templates containing boilerplate text,
    like at the comments at the beginning of a class or method, with a
    couple of clicks of the mouse, and you can use the macro feature to
    capture a sequence of keystrokes to be played back at a later
    point. Also, you can bind any editing command or macro to hot keys
    using the <I>Options-&gt;Key&nbsp;Mapping...</I> menus.<P>

    Finally, you will probably want to use the <I>Execute</I> menu to
    compile your programs from within the editor. With a .java file in
    an editing window, click on the <I>Execute</I> menu button and
    select <I>DOS&nbsp;Command&nbsp;to&nbsp;Window...</I> (or press
    <CODE>&lt;F11&gt;</CODE>) to bring up a dialog box. The command you
    want to execute is &quot;<CODE>javac&nbsp;%f</CODE>&quot;, which
    will compile the file you are editing. If that doesn't work, you
    may need to give the full pathname to the java compiler,
    &quot;<CODE>C:\JDK1.3\bin\javac&nbsp;%f</CODE>&quot; for example.
    Once you have done this one time, the editor will remember the
    command the next time you press <CODE>&lt;F11&gt;</CODE>.

</OL>

<H2><A name="ultraedit">UltraEdit</A> ($30)</H2>

[ <A href="http://www.idmcomp.com">Download from IDM Computing.</A> ]<P>

This is an excellent shareware programmer's editor. It may not have
quite as many customization features as PFE (it has macros and
templates, but they aren't quite as rich as PFE's), but it does do
syntax highlighting (which a lot of people like), has some other
features that PFE is missing, and needs very little work to get it set
up &quot;right&quot;. Just unzip the file you download, and run
Uedit32i.exe to install it. The one thing you want to make sure you do
is to go to the Advanced menu, select Configuration, go to the Edit
tab, and be sure you have selected the &quot;Use spaces in place of
Tabs&quot; checkbox.<P>

To compile Java programs from within UltraEdit, go to the Advanced menu
and click on the "Tool Configuration ..." menu item.  For the command
line, type <U>javac -deprecation &quot;%f&quot;</U>.  Leave the
"Working Directory" field empty, type "Javac" for the Menu Item Name
(or whatever you want to appear on the Advanced menu), turn on "Output
to List Box" and "Capture Output."  Be sure to click on Insert before
you click on OK, or your settings will get lost.  Now, when you are
editing a Java source file you can compile it by clicking on
Advanced->Javac or by typing Ctrl-Shift-0.  Any syntax errors will show
up in a panel at the bottom of the editor window.  Click on an error
message to take you to the correspoinding line in the source file.<p>

Some of the other features I like about UltraEdit are its &quot;column
mode&quot; which lets you insert, move, and delete columns of text the
way you normally work with lines, and its &quot;hexadecimal mode&quot;
which lets you look at and modify the binary codes for the characters
(or anything else) in your file. It also handles plain text files a bit
better than PFE, and it lets you look at the spaces and tabs (there
better not be any of the latter!) in you file. It also lets you put a
column indicator on the screen so you can see when you are getting
close to your righthand margin. Finally, it comes with a utility (and
instructions) that lets you replace Windows' abominable Notepad editor
with UltraEdit in a clean way. All in all, it's a full-featured product
for a very reasonable price. You can try it free for a month, then you
have to send the author $30. After a year, you have to pay another $15
if you want to download updated versions.<P>

<H2>ED for Windows ($99)</H2>

[ <A href="http://www.getsoft.com">Download from Soft As It Gets.</A> ]<P>

You can evaluate this editor free for 45 days. It's got a lot of nifty
features, but the cost puts it beyond what is reasonable to spend for
this course, I think.<P>

<H1>Utilities</H1>

<A name="winzip"><H2>WinZip</H2></A>

[ <A href="http://www.winzip.com">Download from WinZip.com.</A> ]<P>

<H3>Installing WinZip</H3>

The file you download will be an executable file that you should save on
your hard drive. I suggest that you make a directory named <CODE>C:\Download</CODE>
to hold files that you download. Run the program by double-clicking on
it to install it. I recommend that you select &quot;classic&quot; and
&quot;express installation&quot; when asked.<P>

The &quot;WinZip Internet Extension&quot; is a separate program that you
can download and run, which will automatically start up WinZip when you
download a zip file from the Internet. The idea of creating a directory
named <CODE>C:\Download</CODE>, by the way, comes from the default
configuration this program likes to work with. You can just install it
and forget about it; it will do its thing when appropriate.<P>

<H3>Using WinZip</H3>

A zip file is a container for a collection of other files. They are
great for sending files by email because the orginal file names and
relative directory structure are preserved and because the zip file is
compressed so you transfer fewer bytes over the network compared to
sending separate files. All projects and assignments in this course are
to be submitted in zip files.<P>

The WinZip utility can be used both to create zip files (also called <I>archives</I>)
and to extract files from archives (also called <I>unzipping</I> the
archives).<P>

To create a zip file for submitting an assignment, follow these steps:

<OL>

  <LI>Start up WinZip, for example by double-clicking on its icon on the
    desktop, or by using the Windows Start Menu.

  <LI>Click on the &quot;New&quot; icon.

  <LI>Navigate to a convenient directory where you want your zip file to
    be created.

  <LI>Type in the name of the zip file that you want to create. For
    example, typing &quot;Project_1&quot; will create an empty archive
    named <CODE>Project_1.zip</CODE> in the selected directory.

  <LI>Use the Add button to add files to the archive.

  <LI>When you have added <I>all</I> the files you are going to submit,
    exit WinZip, attach the archive to an email message, and send the
    message to me.

</OL>

You can add files to an archive after you close it, or remove or replace
files if you need to. Just be sure that you submit <I>one</I> zip file
containing <I>all</I> the files for each exercise or assignment that you
submit.

<H1>Integrated Development Environments</H1>

There are several good Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for
Java, including IBM's VisualAge, Microsoft's Visual J++, Inprise'
JBuilder, and Symantec Cafe. Each of them combines a program editor,
the compiler, online help, and a debugger into a single development
tool. (Note that the F11 key lets you run the compiler from within PFE,
but PFE doesn't automatically match syntax error messages with the
lines in your source file the way IDEs do.)<P>

I do <I>not</I> recommend that you use an IDE for this course for two
reasons. The first is that getting an IDE set up and mastering its use
will take time and effort that will distract you from the content matter
of the course. The second is that you are required to submit all code so
that I can compile and test it using the JDK. If you develop the code
using an IDE, you then have to extract the .java files from the IDE
environment and test them using the JDK to make sure they still work.
This extra work will, I think, more than offset any efficiency you get
by using the IDE for development.<P>

Having said that, I will say that I think the IBM IDE is particularly
good, and they have made a copy of it available for students to use at
no cost. If you are interested, see me about borrowing the CD.<P>
