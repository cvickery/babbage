<h1>JVM Memory Regions</h1>
</center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The table below summarizes the parts of memory that are allocated and
initialized when a class file is loaded into a Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) and when a class is instantiated.<p>

All the memory ("RAM") of a JVM consists of bytes. Each byte consists
of 8 binary digits (bits). Each bit can have a value of 0 or 1.
Different types of variables occupy a certain number of contiguous
bytes in memory.  For example each variable of type <i>int</i> uses 4
bytes, and each variable of type <i>char</i> is uses 2 bytes.  In
addition to variables, the bytes of RAM can hold the machine language
instructions that tell the processor what operations to perform.  The
machine language instructions for the JVM are called "bytecodes."  Each
executable statement is translated into bytecodes by the <i>javac</i>
compiler.<p>

Individual bytes in memory are identified by binary numbers called
addresses.  Normally, Java programmers never see the binary numbers for
memory addresses, but programmers deal with addresses indirectly: the
values of reference variable are actually memory addresses.  Memory
addresses are also called "pointers."  (The Java language uses the
special value <i>null</i> to represent a memory address that never can
be used to actually reference memory, namely zero.)<p>

So, a JVM uses memory to hold both the instructions and the data that
make up an executable program.  And it uses memory addresses to locate
the instructions and the data as the program executes.  Although all
bytes are just sets of ones and zeros and could potentially contain
either instructions or data, the memory of a JVM is logically divided
into different regions that hold different parts of the program in an
organized fashion.  When a JVM first starts running, much of the memory
is not assigned to any particular region, but as the program runs,
pieces of this unassigned part of memory are assigned to particular
parts of the various logical regions, a process called <i>allocating
memory.</i><p>

<h2>Overview of JVM Memory Regions</h2>

<ul>

    <li><b>Method Area</b>  This region is used to hold executable byte
    codes.  It takes its name from the fact that all executable code in
    a Java program is part of some <i>method.</i>  But it can hold
    other information as well, as shown in the table.

    <li><b>Heap</b>  This is the name for the region used for
    allocating memory for new objects.  Reference variables (except
    null) always contain addresses of memory within this region.

    <li><b>Runtime Stack</b>  Each thread of execution is allocated its
    own runtime stack, which is used for parameters, return addresses,
    and local variables.  A thread's runtime stack grows and shrinks as
    the thread enters methods and returns from them.
    
    <li><b>Program Counter</b>  This is a small piece of memory that
    contains the address of the next bytecode to be executed by a
    thread.  Programmers never deal with program counters directly, but
    are used by the processor to execute statements in sequence, in
    loops and other control structures, and for calling/returning
    to/from methods.
    
    <li><b>Constant Pool</b>  This is a houskeeping region used by the
    JVM to keep track of various parts of the class files that have been
    loaded into memory.

</ul>

<h2>Lifetime and Scope</h2>

The pieces of information that make up a program have two attibutes,
called <i>lifetime</i> and <i>scope.</i>  Lifetime refers to the moment
in time when the variable is allocated memory from one of the regions of
the JVM until that memory is no longer allocated for that purpose any
more.  Scope refers to the parts of a program that can refer to other
parts of the program.  For example, statements in one method have no way
to access the local variables declared in another method because those
variables are not in scope when the first method is executing.

<h2>The Table</h2>

<b>Note:</b> This table does not incorporate information about access modifiers
(public, private, and protected), which affect the Scope column.<p>

  <tr>
    <td valign=top>Static Variables

    <td valign=top>Method Area

    <td valign=top>From the moment the class is loaded to the moment
    the program exits the JVM.

    <td valign=top>Anywhere the class name is known.

    <td valign=top>Access using the class name, a dot, and the variable
    name except inside the class where the variable is defined, where
    just the variable will suffice.  Can also be accessed through
    reference variables pointing to objects of the class' type, but
    this practice generally leads to obscure code.

  <tr>

    <td valign=top>Non-static ("instance") Variables

    <td valign=top>Heap

    <td valign=top>From the moment an object is created (using "new")
    to the time there are no more references to the object.

    <td valign=top>Anywhere there is a reference variable pointing to
    the object.

    <td valign=top>The memory for an object contains room for a copy of
    each of the non-static variables for the class, plus some
    housekeeping information.

  <tr>

    <td valign=top>Local Variables

    <td valign=top>Runtime Stack

    <td valign=top>From the moment a thread enters a method to the
    moment it returns.

    <td valign=top>Only statements within the method.

    <td valign=top>Local variables for static and non-static methods
    are handled identically.  Each time a method is called, stack
    memory for a new copy of all the local variables is allocated;
    there is no way to preserve local variables' values across method
    calls.<p>
    Two different threads can be executing in a method at the same
    time, each with its own copy of the local variables because each
    thread has its own runtime stack.

  <tr>

    <td valign=top>Static Methods
    <br> (executable byte codes)

    <td valign=top>Method Area

    <td valign=top>From the moment the class is loaded into memory
    until the program exits the JVM.

    <td valign=top>Anywhere the class name is known.

    <td valign=top>Access using the class name, a dot, and the method
    name except inside the class where the method is defined, where
    just the variable name may be used.  Can also be accessed through
    reference variables pointing to objects of the class' type, but
    this practice generally leads to obscure code.

  <tr>

    <td valign=top>Non-static ("instance") Methods
    <br> (executable byte codes)

    <td valign=top>Method Area

    <td valign=top>From the moment the class is loaded into memory
    until the program exits the JVM.

    <td valign=top>Anywhere there is a reference variable pointing to
    an object of the class.

    <td valign=top>There is just one copy of each method, whether
    static or not, no matter how many or how few times a class is
    instantiated.  Instance methods are loaded into the method area
    when the class file is loaded, even if the program never
    instantiates the class.
