This page gives a suggested structure for the code that you are to
write for Project 1.  However, you are free to design your code
differently if you prefer, provided: (1) your code runs as an
application, (2) your code uses the class files I provided, and (3)
your code implements each of the commands described in the assignment
page, using the same syntax.  Run the complete program I provided to
you to see examples of the messages the program prints.  Again, your
messages don't have to look exactly like mine, but make them clear,
informative, and grammatically correct!<p>

<H2>Main()</H2>

  If there are no command line arguments
    Create a BufferedReader for System.in
    Invoke processCommands
    Exit

  For each command line argument
    Create a BufferedReader for the file
      Print an error message if unable to create b.r.
      continue to next command line argument
    Print a message telling the name of the file
    Invoke processCommands

  Exit


<H2>processCommands()</H2>

  Loop:
    If interactive, print a prompt message
    Read a line from b.r.
      If end of input, return
    If not interactive, print the line
    Tokenize the line
    If no tokens continue to next iteration of Loop.

    If first token is "help"
      print help string
      continue to next iteration

    If first token is "quit"
      Exit

    If first token is "new"
      If there are not two more tokens
        print an error message( usage for new )
        continue to next iteration
      Convert next token to width
        if invalid
          print an error message( width is not a number )
          continue to next iteration
      Convert next token to height
        if invalid
          print an error message( height is not a number )
          continue to next iteration
      If there is a current Drawing, hide it
      Create a new Drawing of type CDrawing
      Show the Drawing
      Print it
      continue to next iteration

    If the first token is "win"
      If there are not two more tokens
        print an error message( usage for win )
        continue to next iteration
      Convert next token to width
        if invalid
          print an error message( width is not a number )
          continue to next iteration
      Convert next token to height
        if invalid
          print an error message( height is not a number )
          continue to next iteration
      If there is a current Drawing, hide it
      Create a new Drawing of type GDrawing
      Show the Drawing
      (Print it)
      continue to next iteration

    If the first token is "line"
      If there are not 4 more tokens
        print an error message( usage for line )
        continue to next iteration
      Convert next token to x1
      Convert next token to y1
      Convert next token to x2
      Convert next token to y2
        If any of above fails
          print an error message( getMessage() is not a number )
          continue to next iteration
      Pass the four arguments to drawLine
        If there is an exception
          print an error message( getMessage() is not in picture )
          continue to the next iteration
      Print the Drawing
      continue to next iteration

    (Similarly for rectangle and circle)

    If the first token is show, hide, clear
      [ Print usage msg if there are more tokens ]
      Call the corresponding function
      Print the Drawing
      continue to next iteration

    If the first token is "list"
      [ Print usage msg if there are more tokens ]
      Print the string returned by listItems()
      continue to next iteration

    If the first token is "select"
      If there is not one more token
        Print an error message( usage for select )
        continue to the next iteration
      Convert the token to an item number
        If that fails
          Print an error message( item number is not a number )
          continue to next iteration
      Invoke highlightItem with user's item # minus 1
        If that fails
          Print an error message( invalid item number )
          continue to next iteration
      Print the Drawing
      continue to next iteratation

    If the first token is "erase"
      If there are no more tokens
        Invoke deleteItem with no arguments
          If that fails
            Print an error message( nothing selected )
            continue to next iteration
        continue to next iteration
      If there is one more token
        Convert the token to an item number
          If that fails
            Print an error message( item number is not a number )
            continue to next iteration
        Invoke deleteItem with user's item # minus 1
          If that fails
            Print an error message( invalid item number )
            continue to next iteration
        continue to next iteration
      If there is some other number of tokens
        Print an error message ( usage for erase )
        continue to next iteration

    Print an error message( invalid command )
    continue to next iteration
