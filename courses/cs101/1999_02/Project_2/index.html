The purpose of the projects is for you to learn how to program by
writing code.  There is no substitute for doing it yourself.  If you
need help, ask me, or post a message to the course newsgroup as
described on the [&nbsp;<a

web page for the course</A>&nbsp;].

<H2>Project Description</H2>

I am again providing you with class files for all parts of the project,
which you can download using [&nbsp;<a HREF="vickery.zip">this
link</A>&nbsp;].<p>

Documentation for the class files I am supplying is available [&nbsp;<a
HREF="docs">here</A>&nbsp;].<p>

Your assignment is to write the code for three class files which will
serve as substitutes for three of the class files that I have provided.
Each of your classes must do exactly the same things as my corresponding
class files.  That is, each of your classes must implement the same
methods using the same arguments and return types as the ones I have
supplied.<p>

Work on the project incrementally.  You will not be successful if you
work on more than one of the three classes at a time.  Furthermore, I
expect you to develop the classes in the following sequence:
<OL>
  <LI>Class CDrawing
  <LI>Class Drawing
  <LI>Class Coordinates
</OL>
Each of these classes is described in greater detail in the sections
that follow.

<H2>Required Classes</H2>

  <H3>CDrawing</H3>

  This is the class that handles "character drawings" which use of a
  printable matrix of characters to show what a drawing looks like.<p>

  This should be the easiest class to implement because much of the work
  it needs to do is taken care of by other classes.  Class Drawing,
  which class CDrawing extends, provides all the work for managing the
  display list for a drawing, and keeps track of whether the drawing is
  visible or not.  Meanwhile class Coordinates and its two subclasses,
  LineCoordinates and CircleCoordinates, can be used to find out where
  the dots or asterisks go in the drawing.<p>
  
  Follow this sequence of development steps for this class:
  
  <OL>

    <LI>Write empty versions of the constructor and the
    <I>toString()</I> method for this class.  (Consult the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="docs/CDrawing.html">documentation for this class</A>&nbsp;]
    to see the signatures and descriptions of these.)  You do not need
    to define the fields yet.  Your constructor should just pass the two
    parameters it receives to the superclass' constructor using
    <I>super()</I>.  At this point, your <I>toString()</I> method should
    just return a pointer to a String with no characters in it.<p>

    Test your class by compiling it and using it in place of the
    CDrawing.class file that I supplied.  You should be able to run the
    program, and all commands should work, except that when the user
    issues the new command, no output should appear on the screen, even
    though the user gives line, circle, and rectangle commands.  Show
    and hide should cause no errors, and list should still show the
    display list correctly.  Highlight should still update the display
    list correctly too.<p>

    <LI><A NAME="CDrawing_toString">Now implement the <I>toString()</I>
    method</A>.  You can see what fields I used by looking at the class
    documentation.  If you prefer, you could make these fields local
    variables in toString() rather than instance fields.  Think about
    which place makes more sense for them.<p>

    Your <I>toString()</I> method will have to go through two phases. 
    First, traverse the display list to see what items are currently in
    the drawing and setting characters to dot or asterisk in your
    character matrix based on what you find in the display list.  Then,
    generate a printable string, including line separators, based on
    the characters in the matrix.<p>

    The display list is a Vector of _DrawingItem objects managed by
    class Drawing, and named <I>itemList</I>.  Because itemList is a
    protected field in class Drawing, you can access it directly (by
    name) from CDrawing.  Class Vector has a method named
    <I>elements()</I> which will give you a reference to an object
    containing all the, duh, elements in the Vector.  This object will
    be an instance of a class that implements the Enumeration
    interface, so you can use <I>hasMoreElements()</I> and
    <I>nextElement()</I> to go through all the _DrawingItems.  I
    suggest that you start work on the first phase of <I>toString()</I>
    by just printing the information about each item (its elementType
    and the values of x1, y1, x2, and y2) to make sure you are handling
    the enumeration correctly.<p>

    To continue your work on the first phase of <I>toString()</I>,
    <I>remove all invocations of System.out.println() from your
    toString() method</I> and then implement the following algorithm:
    <ul>
      <LI>Put blanks in all the characters of a doubly-subscripted array
      of <CODE>char</CODE>.  The number of rows and columns in this
      array are the values of the height and width parameters passed to
      the CDrawing constructor.

      <LI>Enumerate or iterate over the elements in the display list. 
      For each item:

      <ul>

        <LI>Set the drawing character to '.' (a dot).

        <LI>See <I>Note 1</I> below.

        <LI>Create an object of class LineCoordinates or
        CircleCoordinates for this item.  In the case of rectangles, you
        will have to create four objects of class LineCoordinates, one
        for each side.  See <I>Note 2</I> below.

        <LI>Enumerate over the all the Point objects in the Coordinate
        object(s) you just created, and use each Point's x and y values
        to tell which character in your doubly-subscripted array to
        replace with the drawing character.  See <I>Note 3</I> below.

      </ul>

    </ul>
    <p>
    
    For the second phase of <I>toString()</I> you need to turn the
    doubly-subscripted array of char into one big printable String to be
    returned by the method.  Create a StringBuffer object, and iterate
    over all the rows and columns of your doubly-subscripted array of
    char, appending each char to the StringBuffer.  Append the
    appropriate line separator to the StringBuffer at the end of each
    row of output.  You can pass the StringBuffer as an argument to the
    constructor for the String object to be returned.<p>  

    <I>Note 1.</I>  After you have both phases working and have
    verified that all the drawing elements are being displayed
    properly, insert code at the step indicated by the note to change
    the drawing character to '*' (an asterisk) if the current item is
    the selected item.  The index of the selected item is kept in the
    <I>selected</I> field of class Drawing.<p>
    
    Alternatively, you can make sure that the selected item appears "in
    front of" all the other items by drawing it again as a separate
    operation <I>after</I> you have put dots in the matrix for all the
    items.  This way, any cells where the selected item and another item
    cross will be sure to show up as asterisks instead of dots.<p>

    <I>Note 2.</I>  Refer to the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="docs/Coordinates.html">documentation for class
    Coordinates</A>&nbsp;] for information about these "container
    classes."  As an example, if you create a LineCoordinates object,
    you give the coordinates of the two endpoints of a line to the
    constructor, and the object you create will contain the coordinates
    of all the points that would need to be filled in to draw a line
    between those two endpoints.  Each pair of coordinates is stored as
    an object of class <CODE>java.awt.Point</CODE>, which you should
    look up in your JDK documentation.  (Points have <I>int</I> fields
    named <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> whose meanings you probably can
    guess.)<p>
    
    Class Coordinates (and by inheritance, classes LineCoordinates and
    CircleCoordinates) provides methods <I>hasMorePoints()</I> and
    <I>nextPoint()</I> that let you enumerate over the Points in a line
    or circle in the usual way.  Because <I>nextPoint()</I> returns a
    reference to a <CODE>Point</CODE> instead of a reference to an
    <CODE>Object</CODE>, you don't have to cast the value returned.<p>

    <I>Note 3.</I>  In the slides for [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="../Lectures/Lecture_17">Lecture 17</A>&nbsp;] it says to use
    private methods for putting the dots or asterisks in the array,
    which is the way I did it in my code.  You don't have to write
    these separate methods if you would rather just put the code
    directly inside your <I>toString()</I> method.<p>

    <LI>Add the code to generate a border around the drawing, as my code
    does.  You won't lose too much credit if you omit this feature, so
    skip it if you are short on time.<p>
  </OL>

  Test your program carefully to be sure it performs all operations
  involving class CDrawing correctly: new, line, circle, rectangle,
  hide, show, and erase.<p>

  <H3>Drawing</H3>

  The purpose of class Drawing is to manage the display list for a
  drawing, along with associated variables to control a drawing's
  visibility and to select an item for highlighting.<p>
  
  The strategy for developing this class is similar to the one used for
  class CDrawing:  First provide a "skeleton" version of the class that
  doesn't do anything, but which will work (doing nothing) with the
  other classes in the project.  Again, here is a sequence of steps to
  follow:<p>
  
  <OL>

    <LI><B>Build the skeleton.</B>  Consult the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="docs/Drawing.html">documentation for class Drawing</A>&nbsp;]
    to see what fields, constructors and methods you need to
    implement.<p>
    
    <dir>

      <B>Fields.</B>  Assign initial values to all the fields: zero for
      the height and width, minus one for selected, true for visible,
      an empty Vector for itemList, and the String returned by
      System.getProperty( "line.separator" ) for NL.<p>

      <B>Constructor.</B>  The constructor receives two <I>int</I>
      values, assign the first one to <CODE>width</CODE>, and the
      second one to <CODE>height</CODE>.<p>

      <B>Methods.</B>  There are 12 methods to implement, but only two
      of them return values, <I>toString()</I> and <I>listItems()</I>. 
      Code each of these methods with nothing in the method body,
      except <I>toString()</I> and <I>listItems()</I>, which should
      return empty strings. (&nbsp;<CODE>""</CODE>&nbsp;).  (As it
      turns out, method <I>toString()</I> is never called, and can
      safely be omitted from the class.)<p>
      
    </dir>

    With this implementation, you should be able to run the project,
    and everything should appear to work -- except that the hide
    command will have no effect, the list command will print an empty
    message, and the drawing will always be empty.  But you should see
    empty drawings with the correct dimensions.  (Graphics drawings
    will suffer the same fate.)<p>

    <LI><B>Implement <I>hide()</I> and <I>show()</I>.</B>  By
    implementing these methods, the user will be able to make drawings
    appear and disappear.  But the drawings will still be empty, of
    course.<p>
    
    <LI><B>Implement <I>drawLine()</I>.</B>  This method must validate
    the coordinates passed to it to be sure the two endpoints have x
    values between zero and width minus 1 and y values between zero and
    height minus 1.  If not, throw the appropriate exception.  The
    exception that you throw must have an appropriate message.<p>
    
    This method must also create a new [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="docs/_DrawingItem.html">_DrawingItem</A>&nbsp;] each time it
    is called, and use <I>addElement()</I> (from class
    java.util.Vector) to add the item to the display list.<p>

    When you have this method working, you should be able to create
    drawings with any number of lines in them.  But rectangles and
    circles won't show up yet, and the list command will still print
    nothing.<p>
    
    <LI><B>Implement <I>drawCircle()</I> and <I>drawRectangle()</I>.</B> 
    The code for this step is very similar to the previous one.<p>
    
    Test to be sure that you can draw shapes in all four corners of a
    drawing, but not outside it.<p>
    
    <LI><B>Implement <I>highlightItem()</I> and
    <I>unhighlightItem()</I>.</B>  Be sure the select command now
    works.<p>

    <LI><B>Implement <I>listItems()</I>.</B>  The strategy here will be
    similar to that used in <CODE>CDrawing.<I>toString()</I></CODE>. 
    That is, you will need to create a StringBuffer, and append text to
    it to build up the information to be displayed to the user.<p>

    You should find that some of the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="../Lectures/Lecture_19/BuildString.html">sample code from
    Lecture 19</A>&nbsp;] is useful to get you started on this task.<p>

  </OL>
  
  <H3>Coordinates</H3>

  Class Coordinates is very much analogous to class Drawing.  It
  performs the housekeeping functions for its subclasses
  (LineCoordinates and CircleCoordinates).  As you can see from the
  [&nbsp;<a HREF="docs/Coordinates.html">documentation for this
  class</A>&nbsp;], this class provides a protected member called
  <CODE>_points</CODE>, which is a Vector, and another protected member
  called <CODE>_enum</CODE>, which is an Enumeration.  This class
  creates an empty Vector for <CODE>_points</CODE> each time it is
  instantiated.  Each subclass' constructor is responsible for adding
  an appropriate set of Point objects to this Vector and for creating an
  enumeration of the Vector once all the Points have been added.  The
  methods in class Coordinates provide "wrapper methods" for
  <I>_enum.hasMoreElements()</I> and <I>_enum.nextElement()</I>.  These
  wrapper methods (<I>hasMorePoints()</I> and <I>nextPoint()</I>) just
  provide more meaningful names for the methods they are wrapped around.
  In addition, <I>nextPoint()</I> takes care of getting an Object out of
  the Vector and returning it as a Point so that other methods don't
  have to do the cast.<p>
  
  Method <CODE>enumerate()</CODE> is not really used in this project. 
  It is there in case another method wants to enumerate the points in a
  drawing item again after the initial time through them.  Since we
  create new LineCoordinate and CircleCoordinate objects for every
  drawing item every time we draw the drawing on the screen, this method
  never gets called.<p>

<H2>Extra Credit Classes</H2>

Since these classes are for extra credit, you may develop them in any
order you please, but you will receive credit only for completely
documented and working classes.

  <H3>GDrawing</H3>

    I used a Frame object, which holds a Canvas object, for graphics
    drawings.  The actual drawing is done by overriding Canvas'
    <I>paint()</I> method.

  <H3>LineCoordinates</H3>

    If the line is more horizontal than vertical, create a Point for
    each value of x between x1 and x2, inclusive.  If it is more
    vertical than horizontal, create a Point for each value of y between
    y1 and y2.  Be sure to include the end points, and be sure to handle
    the case when (x1,y1) is the same as (x2,y2).<p>

  <H3>CircleCoordinates</H3>

    The following code will generate a Point object for each coordinate
    in the first octant of a circle.  Because of 8-way symmetry, seven
    additional points can be generated for each one shown here to give
    a complete circle.
<pre>
    int r = Math.abs( diameter / 2 );
    int x = 0, y = r;
    int p = 1 - y;
      while ( x &lt;= y ) {
        new Point( x1 + y, y1 + x )
        x++;
        if ( p &lt; 0 ) 
          p += 2 * x + 1;
        else {
          y--;
          p += 2 * (x - y) + 1;
        }
      }
</pre>
