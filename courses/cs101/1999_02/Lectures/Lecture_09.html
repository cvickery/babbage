    <LI><B>Sample code</B> for [&nbsp;<a HREF="Class_A.html">class
    A</A>&nbsp;]<p>
    When an application's first class is loaded, the JVM executes any
    class initialization code (initialization of static variables and
    execution of statements in <CODE>static</CODE> blocks, and
    <B>then</B> it looks to see if there is a main() method to execute. 
    The sample code, as shown, prints some messages, and then exits
    before the JVM tries to find main().  If the call to System.exit()
    is taken out of the static initialization block, the messages will
    still print, but the JVM will then print an error message saying
    that it cannot find main().<p>
    
    Every class has a toString() method that can be used to get a
    String that represents the object.  You don't have to write the
    toString() method if you don't want to, because class Object
    provides one, and all classes are subclasses of class Object (or
    subclasses of classes that are subclasses of class Object, or
    subclasses of classes that are subclasses of classes that are
    subclasses of class Object, or ... ).  If you don't write a
    toString() method for your class, your class inherits the toString()
    method of its superclass.  Ultimately, every class either provides
    its own toString() method or inherits one from its superclass.  The
    toString() method provided by class Object returns a String that
    starts with the name of the class, and at sign ( @ ), and a number
    (hexadecimal) called the object's <I>hashcode</I>.  The hashcode
    looks suspiciously like the kind of number you would find inside a
    reference variable, but if so it's an undocumented feature of the
    class library.<p>
    
    To illustrate that every object has a toString() method and to show
    that it is used implicitly whenever you want to print things, I had
    the sample program print the System.out object.  This is admittedly
    a bizarre thing to do, but it illustrates that you can print
    anything because everything has a toString() method, in this case
    the one inherited from class Object.<p>
    
    <LI><B>Classes String and StringBuffer</B>.  (See the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="Lecture_08">Slides From Lecture 8</A>&nbsp;].)  String
    objects cannot be modified once they are created, but StringBuffer
    objects can.  There were blackboard diagrams showing the effects of
    appending information to a StringBuffer object, creating a new
    StringBuffer from a String, and copying a reference to an object
    compared to creating a new object.<p>

    Here are some comments from the source code for class
    StringBuffer in the JDK:<p>

<I><blockquote>
String buffers are used by the compiler to implement the binary 
string concatenation operator <code>+</code>. For example, the code:
<p><blockquote><pre>
    x = "a" + 4 + "c"
</pre></blockquote><p>
is compiled to the equivalent of: 
<p><blockquote><pre>
    x = new StringBuffer().append("a").append(4).append("c")
                          .toString()
</pre></blockquote>

which creates a new string buffer (initially empty), appends the string
representation of each operand to the string buffer in turn, and then
converts the contents of the string buffer to a string. Overall, this
avoids creating many temporary strings. <p>
</blockquote></I>
    
    <LI><B>Class StringTokenizer</B>.  (See the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="Lecture_08">Slides From Lecture 8</A>&nbsp;].)  You already
    saw how to use this class in the ReadString series of programs. 
    Note that The StringTokenizer methods hasMoreTokens() and
    hasMoreElements() do the same thing.  Likewise, the methods
    nextToken() and nextElement() do the same thing.   This is because
    the class StringTokenizer implements the Enumeration interface. 
    Interfaces are covered in Chapter 7 of Deitel and Deitel.<p>

    <LI><B>Class Vector</B>.  (See the [&nbsp;<a
    HREF="Lecture_08">Slides From Lecture 8</A>&nbsp;].)  A Vector is
    like a one-dimensional array in many ways, but you can add and
    remove elements from a Vector whereas you can't change the number of
    elements in an array.  It's sort of like the difference between a
    String, whose length can't be changed once it has been created, and
    a StringBuffer, which supports append, insert, and delete
    operations.  The analogy is not perfect, because you can't change
    the characters that make up a String (you can't change "hello" into
    "aloha" even though they have the same number of characters), but you
    can change the values of the elements of an array at any time.<p>
    
    <LI><B>Enumerations</B>.  The method elements() in class Vector
    returns an Enumeration.  This means that it returns a object that
    provides methods named hasMoreElements() and nextElement() that can
    be used to go through all the elements in the Vector one at a time,
    the way we used hasMoreTokens() and nextToken() to go through the
    Strings in a StringTokenizer in the ReadStrings programs.  An
    Enumeration is an example of an interface, which will be covered in
    more detail later.<p>

    <LI><B>Project 1 and Exam 1</B>.  The due date for Project 1 will be
    postponed to something "reasonable,"  but the exam scheduled for
    March 11 will be held as scheduled.  The project will be to write a
    class named Draw_UI that will provide a command-line user interface
    to a Drawing class that I will provide.  Details will follow when I
    have the Drawing class ready!<p>

</ol>

<H2>Clarification</H2>

A student asked in class whether StringBuffer's append() methods are
superfluous because you can do the same thing with the insert() methods.
I said that was true, and suggested that it might even be the case that
append is implemented internally as a call to insert().  It was pointed
out to me afterwards that my answer was misleading.  In fact, it is much
more efficient to have separate append methods because the logic for
adding characters to the end of an array is much simpler than the more
general logic for inserting characters into an arbitrary position.
