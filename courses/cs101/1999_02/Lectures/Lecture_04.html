<H2>Javadoc</H2>
<I><P>Javadoc</I>, which comes as part of Sun's JDK, is a program that generates Web pages that document your code for you.  To use <I>javadoc</I>, you must put comments in your code in a certain format.  Then you run <I>javadoc</I> with your .java file names as parameters on the command line, and <I>javadoc</I> will generate a set of web pages for you.</P>
<H3>The Javadoc command line</H3>
<P>In addition to a list of the .java files that you want to document, you need to specify two switches to get <I>javadoc</I> to work properly for you.  The first switch is <FONT FACE="Courier New">-author</FONT>, which tells <I>javadoc</I> not to ignore <FONT FACE="Courier New">@author</FONT> tags in your code.  (For some reason the default behavior is to ignore them.)  The second is the <FONT FACE="Courier New">-d</FONT> switch, which you use to specify a directory where the documentation files are to be put.  If you don't use this switch, all the documentation files will go in your current directory, possibly destroying some files you might already have with the same names, and certainly making it difficult to manage the .java and .class files in the directory.  The directory to receive the documentation must already exist before you run <I>javadoc.</P>
</I><P>So, if you have created a sub-directory named <FONT FACE="Courier New">HTML</FONT> to hold the files generated by <I>javadoc,</I> you could run the following command to generate web page documentation files for all the java files in the current directory:</P>
<PRE>&#9;javadoc -author -d HTML *.java</PRE>
<P>There is a [&nbsp;<A HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Coding_Guidelines.html">web&nbsp;page</A>&nbsp;] telling how to write comments for your code and how to use the <I>javadoc</I> "tags" that you need to embed in those comments.</P>
<H2>An Array of Strings</H2>
<P><B>Figure 4.1:</B>&nbsp;[&nbsp;<A HREF="Figure_4.1.gif">Diagram&nbsp;of&nbsp;an&nbsp;Array&nbsp;of&nbsp;Strings&nbsp;in&nbsp;Memory</A>&nbsp;]</P>

<p>Figure 4.1 shows an example of the one-dimensional array of Strings
that is passed to <I>main()</I> when a Java application starts.  For
example, there might be a file named <CODE>MyClass.java</CODE> that
contained the following code:

<PRE>
      public class MyClass {
        public static void main( String[] argv ) { ... }
        }
</PRE>

Figure 4.1 assumes the user entered four command line arguments when
running the program.  For example, the user might have typed:

<PRE>
    java MyClass Four command line arguments!
</PRE>
If the user did type that command line, what would be in each of the
four boxes labelled "An object of class String"?<p>

What would be in the <CODE>length</CODE> box if the user entered the
following command line?
<PRE>
    java MyClass This has 17 command line arguments.
</PRE>
