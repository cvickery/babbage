// A.java

//  Class A
//  ------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
  *   Demonstrates that an application's initial class is loaded and
  *   initialized before the JVM determines whether it contains method
  *   main() or not.
  *
  *   Also illustrates how to translate a character into an integer
  *   value between 0 and 25, which you would need to do for exercise
  *   8.17 in Deitel and Deitel.
  *
  *   Also modified during class to illustrate that you can print
  *   just about anything because every class has a toString() method
  *   that it either provides itself, or inherits from one of its
  *   superclasses.
  *
