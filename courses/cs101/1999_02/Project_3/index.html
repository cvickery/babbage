<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

This project is due by midnight <B>May 25, 1999</B>, which is also the
absolute cutoff date too.  Submit whatever you have completed by the
due/cutoff date to receive any credit for this project.<p>

Send me an email with an attached zip file containing all the Java
source files for your project.  I will supply the class files for
classes Drawing and _DrawingItem, which your project will use for
managing the Display List for this project.

<H2>Cheating Policy</H2>

<B>Don't!</B><p>

Anyone who either gives code to someone else or who uses someone else's
code for any part  of any project in this course will automatically
fail the course.  <I>Note that both the giver and the receiver will
fail the course.</I> People caught cheating are also subject to
disciplinary action by the college.<p>

The purpose of the projects is for you to learn how to program by
writing code.  There is no substitute for doing it yourself.  If you
need help, ask me, or post a message to the course newsgroup as
described on the [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/index.html#newsgroup">home
web page for the course</A>&nbsp;].

<H2>Project Description</H2>

You are to write a Java <I>application</I> that can be used to draw
simple shapes (lines, circles, and rectangles) using the mouse instead
of command lines.  You may click the button below to run an example of
this program, but because you will be running it from an applet, there
are a couple of anomalies.  Because applets are not allowed to exit the
JVM (which would mean shutting down your web browser's JVM), this copy
of the program will not exit.  Because of a bug in Internet Explorer, if
you leave this page and come back to it using that browser, your
drawing's will not reappear.  Because neither Netscape nor Internet
Explorer supports Java 2, the "Help/About" message box will not show
up.<p>

<center>
<applet code=DrawingApplet.class width=150 height=35>Your web browser
does not support Java applets.</applet></center><p>

You can download a [&nbsp;<a HREF="Drawing_GUI.zip">zip file</A>&nbsp;]
containing the example's class files and run the program as an
application instead.  The class containing <I>main()</I> is named
Drawing_GUI.class.<p>

Your application does not have to look or behave exactly the same as
mine, but because of the short amount of time remaining, the best
strategy is undoubtedly to start with the [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Spring99/Lectures/
Lecture_25/Drawing_GUI.html">sample code I provided</A>&nbsp;], and to
add to it to build your complete application.  The remainder of this
document provides you with a sequence of development steps to follow.
<p>

Don't try to do everything at once, because if you do, you will
undoubtedly have something that doesn't work when the deadline arrives,
and you will not receive much (if any) credit for that.  Instead, do
your development incrementally.  Do each step, test it to make sure it
works, <I>save a copy of it</I>, and start working on the next step. 
When the deadline arrives, send the last working copy that you saved. 
It is more important to submit working and well-documented code than
lots of code that doesn't work.<p>

<H2>Development Steps</H2>

<OL>

  <B><LI>Add all the components to the user interface.</B>  [&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Spring99/Lectures/Lecture_27">
  Lecture 27</A>&nbsp;] presented the drawing components you will need
  to complete the user interface.  If you start with the sample code,
  you will need to add a List box, a Panel to hold the "Delete" and
  "Clear" buttons, and those two buttons.  That lecture also covered how
  you can use layout managers to get the user interface to look the way
  you want it to.  Feel free to change the appearance any way that you
  want to, but be sure to include components for (1) selecting the shape
  to be drawn, (2) showing the display list, (3), deleting an item and
  clearing all items, (4) drawing the lines, circles, and rectangles,
  and (5) standard menu items.<p>
  
  Remember, that the JDK has two classes named <CODE>List</CODE>.  One
  is in java.util, but the one you will use is
  <CODE>java.awt.List</CODE>.  You have to use the fully-qualified class
  name in your code:
  <pre>
    java.awt.List myListBox = new java.awt.List( 10, false );
  </pre>
  This will create a List box with room to display 10 items, and which
  will not allow multiple items to be selected at a time.<p>

  At this step, the user should be able to change the size of the Frame
  and everything should still appear all right.  You should be able to
  select menu items and drawing shapes, but nothing should happen when
  you do so.  Making everything work comes later.  For now, just get
  everything to look right.<p>

  <B><LI>Add a simple mouse listener to the Canvas.</B>  Add a mouse
  listener to the Canvas that simply prints the (x,y) coordinates each
  time the mouse is clicked.  You have [&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Spring99/Lectures/
Lecture_21/MouseControl_1.html">sample code from Lecture
  21</A>&nbsp;] that you can use as a model, although you might find it
  easier to use an anonymous class for this listener.<p>
  
  Later on, you will add code to keep track of which mouse click starts
  a drawing item, and which one finishes it.  For now, just print out
  each coordinate pair as the clicks comes in.<p>

  <B><LI>Extend the Drawing class to provide access to the display
  list.</B>  I made a mistake in the design of class Drawing: I didn't
  provide a method that would provide direct access to the elements in
  the display list (the Vector named <CODE>itemList</CODE>).  The
  Canvas used by class GDrawing was an inner class of GDrawing, which
  in turn was a subclass of Drawing, so the Canvas class had access to
  the protected <CODE>itemList</CODE> field of class Drawing.  For this
  project, the Canvas has to be able to access the display list
  (itemList), the coordinates detected by the mouse listener, and the
  state of the radio buttons telling which shape to draw.  The easiest
  way to accomplish all this, I think, is to extend class Drawing with
  another class which includes methods for getting the value of
  <CODE>selected</CODE> and a reference to <CODE>itemList</CODE>.  In
  good "Java Beans" style you should name these methods
  <I>getSelected()</I> and <I>getItemList()</I>.<p>

  You need to be able to verify that your new class works properly, so
  I suggest you should do the following:  Instantiate this new class (I
  called it GUI_Drawing, but you could name it something else if you
  like) and pass a reference to it to the constructor for the Canvas. 
  This implies that you will also have to provide a constructor that
  receives this parameter!  Have the constructor save the value of the
  parameter in an instance field, and add code to the Canvas'
  <I>paint()</I> method to <u>print</u> (a) the number of items in the
  display list and (b) the index of the selected item.  Since you
  haven't written any code to add items to the display list yet, these
  numbers should always be 0 and -1, but seeing them print will verify
  that you have things set up correctly.<p>

  <I>Note:</I>  You could avoid the need to create a separate class as
  the subclass of Drawing by making the class containing <I>main()</I>
  extend Drawing instead of Frame.  There is really no need to subclass
  Frame for this project, so this would be a better design.  But the
  sample code I gave you subclassed Frame, and you might find it easier
  to work from that model.  Whichever design you chose, you will need
  to modify the subclass of Canvas as indicated in the previous
  paragraph.<p>

  <B><LI>Update the mouse listener so it updates the display list and
  the List box on the screen.</B>  Your mouse listener will have to
  keep track of whether a click is the first one for a shape or the
  second one.  There are several ways you can do this.  Normally, I try
  to avoid using "flags," but this is one case where it seems
  appropriate: you can use a boolean instance field in the class that
  holds your mouse listener that is initialized when the class is
  instantiated, and which you change to its boolean opposite each time
  a mouse click occurs.  If you called the variable
  <CODE>isFirstClick</CODE>, you would include a line like,
  "<CODE>isFirstClick = ! isFirstClick;</CODE>" to do this.  If a click
  is the first click, just save the (x,y) coordinates until the next
  click.<p>
  
  When the second click occurs, find out what type of shape the user
  wants to draw (see Lecture 27 for how to determine which checkboxe is
  selected), and pass the proper values to either drawLine(),
  drawRectangle(), or drawCircle().  You have to calculate the width
  and height if it is a Rectangle, and you have to calculate the
  diameter if it is a circle.  (You can make the diameter equal to the
  width or height of the rectangle that surrounds the circle if you
  want to.)<p>

  Remember that you have to deal with DrawingExceptions now.  When you
  constructed the instance of your Drawing subclass you should have set
  the width and height so large that the exceptions will never actually
  occur (unless the coordinates are negative), but you still must put
  the calls to <I>drawLine()</I>, etc. inside a try block, but the
  corresponding catch block doesn't have to do anything -- it just has
  to be there.<p>

  At this point, your <I>paint()</I> method should display the correct
  number of elements in the display list.  If nothing prints, it's
  because <I>paint()</I> isn't being called.  You have to force it to
  be called using the <I>repaint()</I> method when the second mouse
  click occurs.<p>

  <B><LI>Add elements to the List box.</B>  Every time the mouse
  listener adds an item to the display list, have it add a string with
  the name of the shape to the List box <I>add()</I> method.  The names
  should show up in the List box on the screen.<p>
  
  <B><LI>Implement the <I>paint()</I> method for the Canvas.</B> 
  Instead of printing out how many items are in the display list,
  enumerate or iterate over the actual items, and draw the appropriate
  shape for each one.  The methods to use are in the Graphics class:
  <I>drawRectangle(x, y, width, height)</I>, <I>drawOval(x, y, width,
  height)</I>, and <I>drawLine(x1, y1, x2, y2)</I>.  For the oval and
  rectangle, the parameters both define a rectangle with its upper left
  corner at the point (x,y).  If the rectangle is square, the oval will
  be a circle, otherwise you'll get an oval.<p>
  
  <B><LI>Implement highlighting, deleting, and clearing.</B>  These
  operations are optional for this project.  I'll give extra credit if
  you do them, and figuring them out is left for you to do.  Note that
  you will not get any credit for doing them if you haven't completed
  the required parts of the project.<p>
