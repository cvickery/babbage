<H2>Due Date and Deliverables</H2>

This Exercise is due by <B>midnight February 9, 1999</B>.<p>
Send me an email message with a zip file attached to it.  The name of
the zip file does not matter, but it must contain a Java source file
that follows the naming rules of Java:  The source file must define one
public class, and the name of the file must be exactly the same
(including capitalization) as the name of the public class, with an
extension of <CODE>.java</CODE>.<p>

The program you send is to be a Java command-line application that
prints a message telling the number of command-line arguments typed by
the user followed by each argument, one per line, in the reverse order
from which they were entered by the user.<p>

For example, if the name of the public class you write is
<CODE>PrintArgs</CODE>, the following could be a sample interaction to
test the program after it has been compiled:

<PRE>
      <B>C:\CS-101\Exercise_1></B> java PrintArgs you? are how there, Hello
        <B>There were 5 command line arguments:
          Hello
          there,
          how
          are
          you?
      C:\CS-101\Exercise_1</B> java PrintArgs
        <B>There were no command line arguments.
      C:\CS-101\Exercise_1</B> java PrintArgs Good-bye, now!
        <B>There were 2 command line arguments:
          now!
          Good-bye,
      C:\CS-101\Exercise_1</B>

<H2>Sending an Email message With a Zip File Attached.</H2>

You have to create the zip file on your PC.  For more information on
this, see the [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Development_Tools.html">
Development Tools</A>&nbsp;]web page.  <B>Note:</B>
You have to use a zip program designed to run with Windows 95 or later,
such as <I>WinZip</I>.  If you use an older program, such as
<I>pkzip</I>, the filename inside the zip file will be mangled.<p>

If you are working off-campus using an ISP to send me email, you can
attach your zip file using whatever mechanism your mail program
provides.  If you are going to submit your Exercise using the college's
facilities, you need to upload the zip file to your qcunix1 account and
send it to me from there.  The way to upload the file is to use one of the
<I>ftp</I> programs available for Windows. There may be one that
provides a graphical user interface installed on the PCs on campus. (Look
for a program named <I>ws_ftp</I> for example.)  Windows comes with a
command-line version that you can use instead.  Start a DOS prompt
window and change to the directory containing the zip file.  From there
enter the command, <I>ftp qcunix1.acc.qc.edu</I>.  Enter your account
name and password when asked, and when you get the "<CODE>ftp>&nbsp;</CODE>"
prompt, type the command <I>bin</I>.  You should get a message back
about "Type set to I."  This is very important, because if you don't
transfer the file using binary mode it will be mangled during the
transfer.  To upload the file give the command <I>put Whatever.zip</I>,
but substitute the actual name of your zip file for "Whatever."  Once
the upload is complete, exit <I>ftp</I> using the <I>quit</I>
command.<p>

To send the zip file to me from qcunix1, log into your account, start
<I>pine</I>, put the cursor in the heading part of a message to me,
type Control-J, and enter the name of your zip file.  Remember,
filenames are case-sensitive in UNIX, so be sure to type the file name
exactly right.  Alternatively, you can type Control-T instead of the
filename, and pine will show you a list of files, and you can then
select the one to send.<p>

<B>Important:</B> No matter how you send your assignment to me, be sure:
<OL>
    <LI>Use the email address <B>vickery@qc.edu</B>.
    <LI>Put the name of the assignment ("Exercise 1" in this case) in
    the Subject part of the header.
    <LI>Put your real name and student ID number in the body part of the
    message.
</OL>

Consult this link to see what rules you are to follow when writng the
program for this Exercise and for all other assignments in this course.

<H2>[&nbsp;<a HREF="../PrintArgs/PrintArgs.html">Source Code</A>&nbsp;]</H2>

This is not really a programming assignment, it's an exercise to make
sure you have your development environment set up properly for doing the
"real" projects in this course.  So, the link above will give you a
program that prints all of its command line arguments in forward order. 
You should be able to figure out how to modify it to print the number of
arguments and how to reverse the order in which they are printed.
