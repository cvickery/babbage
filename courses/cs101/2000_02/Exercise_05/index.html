<H1>Exercise 5</H1>
</center>

<H2>Overview</H2>
This exercise is designed to give you some practice working with
inheritance.

<H2>Background</H2>
Class <CODE>java.lang.Object</CODE> provides a method named
<I>toString()</I>, which has the following signature:

<pre>
    public String toString()
</pre>

Thus, it follows that every class has a <I>toString()</I> method because
every class is either a direct subclass of class Object or of one of its
decendents.  The Java compiler knows about this special feature of class
java.lang.Object and uses it whenever your code needs a String object,
but you specify a reference to some other type of object.  When this
happens, the compiler automatically converts the object reference into
a call to the <I>toString()</I> method for that object.<p>

For example, System.out.println() has a String as its formal parameter,
so you have to supply a String as the actual parameter whenever you
invoke this method.  Therefore, if <CODE>obj</CODE> is a reference
variable of type java.lang.Object, the following three pieces of code
are all equivalent:

<OL>

  <LI><pre>
      String s = obj.toString();
      System.out.println( s );
      </pre>

  <LI><pre>
      System.out.println( obj.toString() );
      </pre>

  <LI><pre>
      System.out.println( obj );
      </pre>

</OL>

It's case #3 that we were talking about in the previous paragraph.

<H2>Description</H2>

Your exercise is to write two classes, named ParentClass and ChildClass,
With ChildClass a subclass of ParentClass, and ParentClass a direct
subclass of java.lang.Object.  Write a third class named Exercise_5
that contains the main method for the application.  The main method is
to create instances of ParentClass and ChildClass and print each object
using a println() statement like #3 above.<p>

You are to write three versions of classes ParentClass and ChildClass,
and include answers to the following questions in the body of the email
message you send to me:

<OL>

    <LI>Write a version in which <I>toString()</I> is defined in
    neither ParentClass nor ChildClass.  Tell what the program printed,
    and explain what method was being called to produce the String
    printed by System.out.println() for each line of output.

    <LI>Write another version in which <I>toString()</I> is defined only
    in class ChildClass.  (Have it return the String, "I am an object
    of class ChildClass.")  Tell what the program printed, and explain
    what method was being called to produce the String printed by
    System.out.println() for each line of output.
    
    <LI>Write another version in which <I>toString()</I> is defined in
    both ChildClass and ParentClass.  (Have ParentClass.toString()
    return the String, "I am an ojbect of class ParentClass.")  Tell
    what the program printed, and explain what method was being called
    to produce the String printed by System.out.println() for each line
    of output.

    <LI>Write another version in which the <I>toString()</I> method in
    ChildClass() returns the concatenation of the value returned by
    ParentClass.toString() and its own String, with the String
    "\n&nbsp;&nbsp;" between the two.  Tell what the program printed.
    
    <LI>Now modify your main method so that it creates an object of
    type Object; save the reference to the Object in a variable named
    rootObject.  Have your program print rootObject, then assign your
    ParentClass object to rootObject and print rootObject again. The
    program is then to assign your ChildClass object to rootObject and
    print that.  Tell what this version of the program printed, and
    explain the output.

</OL>

To submit this exercise, email me a zip file containing <u><I>only the
final version of your program</I></u> and include answers to all of the
questions above in the body of your email message.
