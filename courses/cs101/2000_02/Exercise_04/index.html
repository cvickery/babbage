<H1>Exercise 4</H1>
</center>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

The purpose of this exercise is for you to practice some array
operations by implementing the SortedWordList class you used in
Exercise&nbsp;3.

<H2>Description</H2>

Write your own implementation of the SortedWordList class used in
Exercise&nbsp;3.  The name of the class must be SortedWordList, and it
must implement each of the following methods, using exactly the method
signatures given here.

<dir><dl>

    <dd><CODE>public&nbsp;boolean
    addWord(&nbsp;String&nbsp;word&nbsp;);</CODE>

    <dt>Searches the array to find <I>word</I> in one of the WordCounter
    objects already in the array.  If the word is <I>not</I> found, add
    it to the array in its proper alphabetical position, and return
    <CODE>true</CODE>.  If the word <I>is</I> found, add one to its
    <CODE>counter</CODE> value, and return <CODE>false</CODE>.

    <dd><CODE>public&nbsp;String wordAt(&nbsp;int&nbsp;index&nbsp;);</CODE>

    <dt>Returns the word at position <I>index</I> in the array.

    <dd><CODE>public&nbsp;int counterAt(&nbsp;int&nbsp;index&nbsp;);</CODE>

    <dt>Returns the value of the counter at position <I>index</I> in the
    array.

    <dd><CODE>public&nbsp;int size();</CODE>
    
    <dt>Returns the number of WordCounter objects currently in the
    array.

</dl></dir>

<H2>Developing the Program</H2>

To write this code, you need to have working copies of classes
CountWords (which you wrote for Exercise&nbsp;3) and WordCounter.  You
can get my source code for these two classes by following the two links
below.

<UL>
    <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="CountWords.html">CountWords.java</A>&nbsp;]
    <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="WordCounter.html">WordCounter.java</A>&nbsp;]
</UL>

<H2>Submitting the Exercise</H2>

Test your program to make sure it can handle any number of file names
on the command line, and make sure it counts words properly, regardless
of the order in which they are added to the list.<p>

Then create a zip file containing only SortedWordList.java and attach
it to an email message to me.  Be sure the Subject line of your message
is "Submitting Exercise&nbsp;4" and that your name and ID number are in
the body of the message.
