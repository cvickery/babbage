<H2>Introduction</H2>

This is an exercise to make sure you have a working setup for writing
Java applications, in using email, and in following instructions.

<H2>Assignment</H2>

I am providing you with a Java application that adds two numbers,
[&nbsp;<a HREF="AddTwoNumbers.html">AddTwoNumbers.java</A>&nbsp;].
If you click on the link to it, you see a web page containing the code.
Your assignment is to:
<UL>

  <LI>Type the equivalent program into a text file.  It's all right to
  cut and paste my code, but the @author tag must have <I>your</I>
  name, not mine, on it.  Document your program in the same style as
  the code I have supplied.  (We went over this in class.)

  <LI>Compile and run the program to make sure it works correctly.

  <LI>Create a zip file containing <u>only</u> the .java file.  Attach
  the zip file to an email message, and send the email message to me
  (vickery@qc.edu). Put "Submitting Exercise 1" in the Subject: line of
  your mail, and put your name and ID in the message part.

</UL>

You can create the zip file using the <I>WinZip</I> program available
for download from the [&nbsp;<a
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Development_Tools.html">Development
Tools</A>&nbsp;] web page, or using the <I>jar</I> program that comes
with the Java Development Kit.  If AddTwoNumbers.java is in your
current directory, you could use the following command to create a zip
file suitable for submission:

<pre>
    jar cvf Exercise_1.jar AddTwoNumbers.java
</pre>

The name of the zip file this creates will be "Exercise_1.jar".  You can
use a file name that ends with ".zip" if you prefer.<p>
