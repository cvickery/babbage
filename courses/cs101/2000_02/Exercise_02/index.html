<H1>Exercise 2</H1>
</center>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
This is an exercise to be sure you can actually edit, compile and run
a Java application.  It also gives you a little practice with one
dimensional arrays.

<H2>Assignment</H2>
Write a Java application that echoes each of its command line arguments,
one per line, on the console.  If the name of your class is Echo, here
is what some interactions with the program should look like:

<pre>
    C:\My Projects> java Echo Testing 1, 2, 3, 4
    Argument 0:       Testing
    Argument 1:       1,
    Argument 2:       2,
    Argument 3:       3,
    Argument 4:       4
    C:\My Projects> java Echo "Testing ... 1 2 3"
    Argument 0:       Testing ... 1 2 3
    C:\My Projects> 
</pre>

Be sure you comment your program in the style used for Exercise 1.  Put
your .java file in a zip file, and email the zip file to me with a
Subject: line of "Submitting Exercise 2", and with your name and ID
number in the body of the message.<p>
