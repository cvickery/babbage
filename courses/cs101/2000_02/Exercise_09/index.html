<H1>Exercise 9</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

This is a "pseudo-project."  You are not actually to submit it, but you
should work on it to prepare for the final exam.<p>

Ideally, you would do a complete MP3 tag editor for this project. 
Realistically, you should be able to build the user interface for
the tag editor and connect it to the user interface to the classes I am
supplying.

<H2>Source Code</H2>

I am supplying the following source code for you to study and extend:

<UL>
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="TagEditor.java.html">TagEditor.java</A>&nbsp;]
  <BR>This version has only the File->Save menu item, Genre label, and
  the genre combobox.  You should add code to this to implement the
  remainder of the user interface, using existing code as a model to
  work from.
  
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="MP3_File.java.html">MP3_File.java</A>&nbsp;]
  <BR>This class manages "real MP3 files", but it's still under
  development.  It can be used to create files with ID3V1 tags and edit
  them, but the audio stream part has not been tested, and the code for
  the ID3V2 tags is "dummy code" at this point.  If you want debugged
  versions of this other code so you can continue working on the project
  over the summer, let me know and I'll send it to you after exams.
  
  <<LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="ID3V1_Tag.java.html">ID3V1_Tag.java</A>&nbsp;]
  <BR>This code can be used to read/modify/write the ID3V1 tag in a
  file.

  <<LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="ID3V2_Tag.java.html">ID3V2_Tag.java</A>&nbsp;]
  <BR>This is dummy code.  Yogesh Patel has done a nice job writing the
  real version of this code, but I haven't had a chance to integrate it
  with the project and test it yet.

  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="MP3_Audio.java.html">MP3_Audio.java</A>&nbsp;]
  <BR>This class is used to manage the audio stream part of MP3 files;
  it can be queried to find out how many minutes and seconds of music
  there are in the file, for example.  This code works, but has not been
  thoroughly integrated with the project.  That means that there may be
  bugs reading/writing the audio stream, so DON'T USE THIS CODE WITH
  REAL MP3 MUSIC FILES.  Well, you can try it, but be sure you keep the
  original copy of the music safe somewhere else!  <B>You have been
  warned!</B>
</UL>

<H2>Development Plan</H2>

Building the user interface is a matter of adding in the menus and menu
items we developed in class, adding all the labels, text fields, and
combo boxes to the content pane, and systematically implementing the
various action listeners and testing them.<p>

We discussed how to do the layout for the user interface in lecture. 
Remember, JPanel is a very useful component because you can do things
like this with it:  BorderLayout allows only one component on, say, the
East side of a container.  If you make that one component a JPanel, you
can then give the JPanel its own layout manager and add multiple
components to it.  For example, you could make a 1-column grid full of
buttons going down the right side of your JFrame using this
code:<p>
<pre>
    JFrame jf = new JFrame( "JPanel_ex" );
    Container cp = jf.getContentPane();
    JPanel jp = new JPanel( new GridLayout(0, 1) );
    jp.add( new JButton("One") );
    jp.add( new JButton("Two") );
    jp.add( new JButton("Three") );
    jp.add( new JButton("Four") );
    cp.add(jp, BorderLayout.EAST);
</pre>

<B>Note:</B> There is lots of code here, and not enough time for you to
master it all before the final exam.  Concentrate on building the user
interface and implementing some of the callback methods.  You will
<I>not</I> have to write code using JPanel on the exam, but you should
know what it is because it was covered in lecture.<p>
