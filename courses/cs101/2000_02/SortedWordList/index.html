<H2>Introduction</H2>

The class SortedWordList was the subject of Exercises 3 and 4.  This
page links you to my solutions for those two exercises.

<H2>Exercise 3</H2>

You should already have this code, but here it is again:

<UL>
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="CountWords.html">CountWords.java</A>&nbsp;]
      <BR>This is the initial class for the project; it contains the
      method <I>main()</I>, which is responsible for managing the files,
      lines of text, words, and the single SortedWordList object used to
      hold words and their frequencies.  This class can only be run if
      classes SortedWordList and WordCounter are in the same directory.
      
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="WordCounter.html">WordCounter.java</A>&nbsp;]
      <BR>This class defines a type of object that can hold a single
      word and a count of how many times it has occurred.  Class
      SortedWordList manages a list of references to objects of this
      class.
</UL>

<H2>Exercise 4</H2>

For Exercise 4, you were to implement class SortedWordList using an
array.  Here is my solution:

<UL>
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="SortedWordList.html">SortedWordList.java</A>&nbsp;]
</UL>

Another way to implement class SortedWordList would be to use an object
of class java.util.Vector instead of an array.  This solution is a
little messy because Vectors hold objects of class java.lang.Object, and
we want to use our Vector to hold objects of class WordCounter.  It's
okay to do this, but there have to be several casts in the code (putting
the class name WordCounter inside parentheses) to make the code compile
without any error messages.  These casts will be covered when we deal
with object-oriented programming (chapter 9).<p>

But note that this solution eliminates the need to write the "helper
method," <I>insertElementAt()</I> that was the heart of the array
solution for the exercise.  That method (and method <I>size()</I>) are
already part of class java.util.Vector.<p>

I've named the file that contains the Vector solution
SortedWordList_Vector.java, but you can use any name you want to for it
because the class defined in it is not public.  If you compile the
program, it will generate a file named SortedWordList.class that is
functionally equivalent to the class file of the same name that you
will get if your compile SortedWordList.java.
