<H2>Introduction</H2>
This is the first part of a two-part assignement.  The overall
assignment is to write a Java application that will print an
alphabetical list of all the words in some text files, along with a
count of how often each word occurs.

<H2>Description</H2>

Your assignment for this week is to write a Java application that gets
the words out of the text files and uses two classes that I am supplying,
SortedWordList and WordCounter, to do the work of creating the list of
words and their frequencies.<p>

In Lecture 5 (February 17) we developed an application that does almost
all the work you need to do.  That code is presented again here as a
sequence of development steps.<p>

It's a good idea to write a little bit of code and test to make sure it
works before writing more code.  That way, when something goes wrong,
you know the problem has to be in the little bit of code that you just
wrote.  The alternative strategy is to write a lot of code and then to
try to get the whole thing to work.  This strategy is a big temptation,
but inevitably causes problems when you have to locate possibly
multiple errors that cause your program not to perform as expected.<p>


The goal of this exercise is to get words out of text files.  This
can't be done directly, so we have to break it down into sub-goals. 
Java provides a class called <I>StringTokenizer</I> that can get words
out of strings, so our first sub-goal is to convert text files into
strings that we can process using the StringTokenizer class.  Well, the
<I>BufferedReader</I> class has a method called <I>readLine()</I> that
will read a line of text from a file and return it as a Java String
object, and this is the approach we will use.  (Another approach might
be to read characters from the files and figure out where the words are
by examining each character read.  But the BufferedReader approach is
much easier to use, so that is the technique you are to use.)  It turns
out that you have to have another Java type of object, a
<I>FileReader</I> in order to create a BufferedReader, so our next
sub-goal is to create a FileReader for each of the text files we want
to process.  In order to create a FileReader, you need the name of the
file that you want to read from, and that leads to the next sub-goal: how
to know what files to process.  For that, we will use the technique
used in Exercise 2, which is to have the user type the names of the
files on the command line.  Unfortunately, the user might type things on
the command line that aren't really the names of files, and we will get
an IOException if we try to create a FileReader based on a bad file
name.<p>


<H3>Step 1</H3>

We will work backwards from the lowest-level sub-goal.  So our first
version of the the code will try to create a FileReader for each file
name the user types on the command line.  If the FileReader constructor
throws any IOExceptions, we will simply print an error message and
continue creating FileReaders for any other names the user supplied.<p>
Here's the code:

<pre>
<HR>
//  CountWords.java
import java.io.*;
public class CountWords
{
  public static void main( String[] argv )
  {
    FileReader fr = null;

    for ( int f=0; f&lt;argv.length; f++ )
    {
      try
      {
        fr = new FileReader( argv[f] );
        System.out.println( "Created a FileReader for file " +
                                                           argv[f] );
      }
      catch ( IOException ioe )
      {
        System.err.println( "Error: " + ioe.getMessage() );
      }
    }
  }
}
<HR>
</pre>

To save space, I'm leaving out the comments, but you should write your
javadoc comments for the code as you go along.<p>

The IOException and FileReader classes are both found in the java.io
package, so we import all the classes from that package.  We went over
the idea behind the try/catch blocks in class.  Read chapter 14 of the
text if you don't understand it.  Or just try running the above program
with various things on the command line to see what is going on.  The
alternative to try/catch would be to put "throws IOException" on the
first line of main:
<pre>
  public static void main( String[] argv ) throws IOException
</pre>

The problem with this approach is that the program will abort with a
long error message (a "stack trace") if a user should happen to make a
mistake in typing one of the names of the files.  The way we are doing
it we can print a more helpful message and continue processing other
files.<p>

<B>Thought Questions: </B>How many variables named fr are there?  How
many FileReader objects are created?  How many of the FileReader
objects can be used at a time?  What happens if the user doesn't type
any file names on the command line?<p>

<H3>Step 2</H3>

Now add the code to create a BufferedReader for each command line
argument:
<pre><hr>
//  CountWords.java
import java.io.*;
public class CountWords
{
  public static void main( String[] argv )
  {
    FileReader      fr = null;
    BufferedReader  br = null;

    for ( int f=0; f&lt;argv.length; f++ )
    {
      try
      {
        fr = new FileReader( argv[f] );
        br = new BufferedReader( fr );
        System.out.println( "Created a BufferedReader for file " +
                                                           argv[f] );
      }
      catch ( IOException ioe )
      {
        System.err.println( "Error: " + ioe.getMessage() );
      }
    }
  }
}

<hr></pre>

Be sure to test this version of the program before doing Step 3.<p>

<B>Thought Questions: </B>Is the variable fr really needed?  How could
it be eliminated?  What is the purpose of invoking System.out.println()
each time through the loop?<p>

<H3>Step 3</H3>

For this step, use readLine() to read each line of each file.  To verify
that the program is working, print out each line, preceded by its file
name.

<pre><hr>
//  CountWords.java
import java.io.*;
public class CountWords
{
  public static void main( String[] argv )
  {
    FileReader      fr    = null;
    BufferedReader  br    = null;
    String          line  = null;

    for ( int f=0; f&lt;argv.length; f++ )
    {
      try
      {
        fr = new FileReader( argv[f] );
        br = new BufferedReader( fr );

        while ( (line = br.readLine()) != null )
        {
          System.out.println( argv[f] + ": " + line );
        }
      }
      catch ( IOException ioe )
      {
        System.err.println( "Error: " + ioe.getMessage() );
      }
    }
  }
}

<hr></pre>

There are other ways to loop through the lines of a file, but this form
of while loop, which combines the reading of a line with the test to see
if the end of the file has been reached, is the most parsimonious way to
write the code.  (If you don't believe me, try to come up with a better
way!)<p>

<B>Thought Questions: </B>What does <I>readLine()</I> return?  How many
variables named line are there?  How many String objects are there?  Why
is "readLine()" preceeded by "br."? What happens if the user types in
the name of a .class file?<p>

<H3>Step 4</H3>
Now we're up almost to the top of our goal list: to extract words from
the lines of text that we are reading.

<pre><HR>
//  CountWords.java
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
public class CountWords
{
  public static void main( String[] argv )
  {
    FileReader      fr    = null;
    BufferedReader  br    = null;
    String          line  = null;
    StringTokenizer st    = null;
    String          token = null;

    for ( int f=0; f&lt;argv.length; f++ )
    {
      try
      {
        fr = new FileReader( argv[f] );
        br = new BufferedReader( fr );

        while ( (line = br.readLine()) != null )
        {
          st = new StringTokenizer( line );
          while ( st.hasMoreTokens() )
          {
            System.out.println( st.nextToken() );
          }
        }
      }
      catch ( IOException ioe )
      {
        System.err.println( "Error: " + ioe.getMessage() );
      }
    }
  }
}
<HR></pre>

Class StringTokenizer is in the java.util package, so be sure to import
the classes from that package when you get to this step.<p>

As shown in class, this code assumes that a "token" (what we want to be
a "word") is any sequence of characters surrounded by whitespace. 
Whitespace means blanks, tabs, and line separators.  The
StringTokenizer constructor has an alternate form that takes a String
as a second argument, and the characters in that second string will be
used as delimiters for the tokens it returns.  For example, you could
use the string literal, <CODE>"&nbsp;\t\n.,!;:()"</CODE> as the second
argument to get the constructor in order to treat both whitespace and
punctuation marks as delimiters.  You would want to have a more
elaborate version if your text files contain other characters in it,
like square brackets(&nbsp;&nbsp;), angle
brackets(&nbsp;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;), curly brackets (&nbsp;{}&nbsp;), or any
other characters in them.<p>

<B>Thought Questions:</B>If there are 3 text files, and each one
contains 6 lines of text, how many StringTokenizers will be created?
How many StringTokenizers can the program access at a time?  If I didn't
show you the <I>hasMoreTokens()</I> and <I>nextToken()</I> methods, how
would you know they exist and how to use them? Can you come up with a
second argument for the StringTokenizer constructor that will do a good
job if you give your program a Java source file as one of its inputs?<p>

<H3>Step 5</H3>

This step goes beyond what we did in class on February 17th.  It uses
the class SortedWordList that I am supplying to create a sorted word
list (<I>duh-oh!</I>) from the words extracted from the text files. 
After all the text files have been processed, the program prints the
entries in the sorted word list.  Rather than give you the entire
program, I'll just show you how to use the methods in [&nbsp;<a
HREF="DOCS/index.html">SortedWordList</A>&nbsp;] and let you integrate
them into your program yourself:<p>

Create a SortedWordList object:
<pre>
  SortedWordList swl = new SortedWordList();
</pre>

Instead of printing each word as it is retrieved from a StringTokenizer,
add it to the sorted word list:

<pre>
  swl.addWord( st.addWord() );
</pre>

After processing all the files, loop through the sorted word list,
printing the counter and word for each element in the array:
<pre>
  for (int i=0; i&lt;swl.size(); i++)
  {
    System.out.println( swl.counterAt(i) + "\t" + swl.wordAt(i) );
  }
</pre>

In order to compile your program for this step, you will need to have
the SortedWordList.class and WordCounter.class files in the same
directory as your CountWords.java file when you compile it.  I have put
these two class files inside a zip file called [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Vickery_E3.zip">Vickery_E3.zip</A>&nbsp;] that you can download by
clicking on the link.  Once you have downloaded that file, extract its
contents to the directory containing your CountWords.java file, and you
will be able to compile your program successfully.  You don't have to
import anything to use these classes because they are in the same
package as your CountWords package, namely the "anonymous" package
consisting of all classes in your current working directory.  (The zip
file contains another file named Manifest.mf in a directory called
meta-inf.  This is because I used jar to create the zip file; you can
simply ignore this extra material, or even delete it if you prefer.)<p>

<B>Thought Questions: </B>How many SortedWordList objects should this
program create?  Given your answer, where should the "new
SortedWordList" statement be?  How important is it for you to use the
variable name "swl" in your program?<p>

<H2>Submit the Assignment</H2>

After you have tested the final version of your program using different
text files and are sure it is working properly, put your .java file
(and nothing else) in a zip file, and email it to me with "Submitting
Exercise 3" on the Subject line and with your name and ID number in the
body of the message.<p>

I assume you wrote all the javadoc comments for the program back when
you started Step 1 and don't need to be reminded again to do that.  But
it would be a good idea to double check that you have proper @author
and @version tags in the comments before the class definition and that
you have a proper @param tag in the comments before the main method.<p>

<HR>

<H2>Answers to Thought Questions</H2>

<B>Step 1: </B>One. As many as the number of command line arguments. One
at a time (any others are eligible for garbage collection). The loop
will be exectuted zero times and the program will exit without printing
anything.<p>

<B>Step 2: </B>No, it's just used to as a bridge between creating the
FileReader and the BufferedReader.  Those two statements could be
combined into the following single statement:

<pre>
  br = new BufferedReader( new FileReader( argv[f] ) );
</pre>
This is called "functional composition," and is used by good programmers
to save unnecessary steps because compact code is often easier to
understand than programs with unnecessary steps.  A good compiler would
generate the same code whichever way it was written, so it's not a
matter of computational efficiency, and there is a fine line between
writing "compact" code and writing "cryptic" code that is hard to
understand because it is <I>too</I> compact.  At this stage of your
career it is probably better to err in the direction of being more clear
at the expense of being a little more wordy.<p>
The print statement is there to tell us that the program is working. 
When we test a version of the program we have to be sure that our test
really does confirm that the program is doing what we expect it to.<p>

<B>Step 3: </B>The <I>readLine()</I> method returns a String that
contains all the characters in one line of a text file, with the line
separator characters (carriage return and linefeed) removed from the end
of the line.  There is one variable named line, but the program will
create as many String objects as there are lines of text in all the
files the program processes.  The "br." tells the run time system which
BufferedReader we want to use for reading the next line.  In this
program, only one BufferedReader object exists at a time, but we still
have to make the connection between the method and the particular
BufferedReader to be used for reading.  If the user types in the name of
any kind of file that does not contain lines of text, such as a .class
file, the Strings that readLine() returns will contain bytes that aren't
character codes, and printing them will result in gibberish on the
screen.<p>

<B>Step 4:</B>Three times six (18) StringTokenizer objects will be
created.  There is just one st variable, so the program can access just
one StringTokenizer at a time.  You would use your web browser to look
at C:\jdk1.2.2\docs\api\index.html, and scroll through the classes to
the entry for StreamTokenizer.  Here's a possiblility for the second
argument: <CODE>" \t\n,.!?;:()[]<>{}+-*/#$%^&|\\'\"="</CODE><p>

<B>Step 5:</B>There should should be just one SortedWordList object
created to hold all the words in all the files, so you have to create
it (i.e., put the "new SortedWordList" statement) before the outermost
loop in the program &mdash; the one that loops through the file names on the
command line.  Likewise, you have to put the loop to print out the list
after the end of that file loop.  The variable name swl is arbitrary
and perhaps a bit obscure.  I picked it because it is the only variable
in the program that references a <u>S</u>orted<u>W</u>ord<u>L</u>ist
object.  If you think the name is too obscure, you should pick a more
meaningful one.
