<H1>Exercise 6</H1>
</center>

<H2>Overview</H2>
The purpose of this exercise is to give you some practice with String
operations, and to practice algorithmic thinking.

<H2>Description</H2>

The exercise is to write a Java application that works something like
the UNIX <I>grep</I> command.  Grep is used to search files for strings,
and has a rich set of options and features on UNIX systems.  The Grep
class you will write will work as follows:  The user will supply an
optional command line parameter, "-i" to make the program <u>i</u>gnore
upper/lower case differences when searching for strings.  The command
line must always have a string to be searched for, and one or more names
of files to be searched.  Here are some sample command lines to show
what we mean:

<pre>
    java Grep hello file1
    java Grep -i Hello file1 file2
    java Grep -i "Hello, world!" file1
</pre>

The first line will print all the lines in a file named
<CODE>file1</CODE> that contain the string, "hello."  The second line
prints all the lines in files <CODE>file1</CODE> and <CODE>file2</CODE>
that contain the string "hello" regardless of how the letters in it are
capitalized.  The last line shows how to put a space inside the string
to be searched for.<p>

If Grep does not find any lines containing the specified search string,
it simply exits without printing anything.

<H2>Development</H2>

This exercise is divided into two separate assignments.  The first,
called Exercise&nbsp;6a, is to process command lines, printing messages
that tell what files will be searched, and whether the searches will be
case sensitive or not.  The second assignment, called Exercise&nbsp;6b,
is to build on the first one by taking out the messages printed in the
first assignment and putting in the code that actually searches for and
prints lines for matching strings.

<H3>Sample Output</H3>

Assume these are the contents of two files:

<pre>
      file1                             file2
      --------------------------        ------------------------------
      Hello, this is file 1.            Hello, this is file 2.
      I have lots of text in me.        I have the word hello in me.
      Look: helloworld. hello.          Don't look: Hello, world!
</pre>


The three commands above would produce the following output for
assignment 6a:

<pre>

    java Grep hello file1
      Case sensitive search for "hello" in the following files:
        file1

    java Grep -i Hello file1 file2
      Case-insensitive search for "Hello: in the following files:
        file1
        file2

    java Grep -i "Hello, world!" file1
      Case-insensitive search for "Hello, world!" in the following files:
        file1

</pre>


The three commands above would produce the following output for
assignment 6b:
<pre>

    java Grep hello file1
      file1: Look: helloworld. hello.

    java Grep -i Hello file1 file2
      file1: Hello, this is file 1.
      file1: Look: helloworld. hello.
      file2: Hello, this is file 2.
      file2: I have the word hello in me.
      file2: Don't look: Hello, world!

    java Grep -i "Hello, world!" file1

</pre>

Note that the third command line produces <I>no output</I> because the
seach string is not contained in the specified file.<p>

If the user types a file name for a file that does not exist or cannot
be read, the 6b version of the program is to print an appropriate error
message and continue on to the next file specified on the command line.
For example:

<pre>
    java Grep -i Hello file1 file3 file2
      file1: Hello, this is file 1.
      file1: Look: helloworld. hello.
    Unable to read file3.
      file2: Hello, this is file 2.
      file2: I have the word hello in me.
      file2: Don't look: Hello, world!
</pre>

<h3>Exercise 6a</h3>

First check if there are at least two command line arguments.  If not
print an error message and exit.  Next check if the first command line
argument is the string "-i".  If it is your program has to remember that
it is going to do case-insensitive searches, and it must remember that
there have to be at least two more command line arguments.  I suggest
using a boolean variable to remember whether the searches will be case
sensitive or not.  And I suggest that you use an int variable to keep
track of the current command line argument you are procesing.  This
variable could start at 0 and be set to 1 if the first argument was
"-i".<p>

The idea is for you to think about how to get the program to work
properly, and then to test it carefully to be sure you actually got it
right.  Here are some more sample outputs you might try at this stage:

<pre>
    java Grep -x there
      Case-sensitive search for "-x" in the following files:
        there

    java Grep "-i hello file1 file2"
      Error: There must be at least two arguments.
      
    java Grep -i hello
      Error: No file name(s) given.
</pre>

In lecture, I suggested that you could have one generic error message
for bad command line arguments, which shows the user the correct command
line syntax.  The error message in this case could be:

<pre>
    Usage: java Grep [-i] &lt;search string&gt; &lt;file&gt;...
</pre>

This is a standard way to tell users that "-i" is optional (by putting
it in square brackets), that the search string and file are names
for things the user is to supply actual values for (by putting them in
angle brackets), and that the file argument may be repeated any number
of times (by following it with an ellipsis (...)).<p>

<h3><a NAME="6b">Exercise 6b</a></h3>

After you have submitted Exercise 6a, remove all the
System.out.println() statements from your Grep.java file.  For each
file name, create a BufferedReader, and loop through the lines in it. 
For each line, extract a substring of the same length as the search
string, starting at an offset of 0 into the line and continuing to the
last position that could possibly start the search string.  Use
<I>equals()</I> or <I>equalsIgnoreCase()</I> as appropriate to compare
each substring to the search string.  If a match is found, print the
file name and the line that contained it, and continue looping through
the lines in the file.  Use a try/catch block to handle files that don't
exist or can't be read.  That's it!<p>

Be sure to document your code properly, and test it thoroughly before
submitting it.<p>
