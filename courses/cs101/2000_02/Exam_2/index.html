<H1>Exam 2 Scoring</H1>
</center>

<H2>Bad Question</H2>

Question 8 was omitted from the scoring.  None of the answers given was
correct because the code given to you would not compile, and if fixed so
it would compile, it would not have reached the print statement without
throwing a ClassCastException first.  Thus, there was no way to print "o2".
(But if it <I>had</I> been able to run, it would have printed
Exam_2@123456.)

<H2>Coding Solutions</H2>
Here are solutions to the three coding questions asked on the
exam.  The solution to Question 31 includes a class and main()
method, which you were not supposed to write; they are included
here so the solution given could be checked to be sure it works.<p>

Note that this is undocumented code; you were not asked to document
your code on the exam.<p>

<H2>Coding Scoring</H2>

The following tables show the the number of points for the variaous
parts of the correct answers to each coding question.  In addition,
points were deducted for general syntax errors and for code that was
written but which was not asked for.<p>
