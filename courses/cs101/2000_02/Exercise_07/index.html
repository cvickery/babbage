<H1>Exercise 7</H1>
</center>
<H2>Overview</H2>

The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice developing an
application with a graphical user interface.

<H2>Description</H2>

In [&nbsp;<a HREF="Lecture_18.html">Lecture 18</A>&nbsp;] we developed
a simple text editor, and in [&nbsp;<a HREF="Lecture_19.html">Lecture
19</A>&nbsp;] we saw how to add menus to a GUI application.  In this
exercise you are to build on the code presented in those two lectures to
build a text editor that looks very much like "a real editor."<p>

Your text editor is to have the following features:

<ol>

  <LI>The user names the file to be edited on the command line.  If
  there is no file name on the command line, it's an error, and the
  program is to exit after printing an error message.

  <LI>When the application starts, the window is to appear in the middle
  of the user's screen and is to contain the contents of the file being
  edited.  (If the user names a file that doesn't exist, the window will
  intially be empty.)

  <LI>The "Close Window" button in the title bar must exit the
  application the same way the File->Exit menu item does.  (See below.)

  <LI>The window is to have a menu bar with a File menu.  The File menu
  is to have menu items to Save the current file and to Exit the
  application.

  <UL>
    <LI>The File->Save menu item writes the contents of the JTextArea to
    the file being edited.
    <LI>The File->Exit menu item writes the contents of the JTextArea to
    the file being edited, and then exits the program.
  </UL>

</ol>

<H2>Due Date</H2>

This exercise is due by midnight, April 18.

<H2>Optional Features</H2>

There are lots of optional features you could build into your
application.  Here are some ideas that would be particularly instructive
to work on.  You could work on them in any order you like, but work on
just one at a time to limit debugging problems.  You'll have to study
the documentation for JTextArea to do most of these.

<UL>

  <LI>Add a File->Open menu open that lets the user edit a different
  file.  Be sure to close the currently open file first.  Use
  JFileChooser to let the user pick the file to be opened.
  (<I>medium-hard</I>)
  
  <LI>Add a File->Save As menu item that lets the user change the name
  of the file being edited.  (<I>easy once you have done File->Open</I>)

  <LI>Keep track of whether the text has been modified or not, and
  disable the File->Save menu item except when the document has changed
  since it was last written to disk.  When the user exits the program,
  check if the document has changed and ask whether to save the changes
  or not, and write the document to disk only if the user replies
  affirmatively. (<I>medium-hard</I>)

  <LI>The font used to show the text on the screen uses proportional
  spacing.  Change the program so the text is shown in a fixed-width
  font.  (<I>medium</I>)

  <LI>Add an Edit menu with cut, copy, and paste menu items.  Make these
  menu items work the same way as the keyboard shortcuts, Control-X,
  Control-C, and Control-V.  (<I>hard</I>)

  <LI>Add a Help menu with an About menu item.  When the user clicks on
  it, display a dialog box (JOptionPane) with a message giving the name
  and version number of the program, and your name.  The dialog box has
  an "OK" button for dismissing it.  (<I>easy</I>)
  
  <LI>Add a meaningful Tooltip to each menu item. (<I>easy</I>)
  
</UL>
