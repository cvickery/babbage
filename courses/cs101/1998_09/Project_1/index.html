<H1>Project 1: <CODE>Checkers_UI</CODE></H1>
</center>
<H2>Due Date and Deliverables</H2>
This project is due by <B>midnight October 6, 1998</B>.<p>

Send me a zip file named &lt;<I>your_email_address</I>&gt;.zip, but
substitute your own email address for
"&lt;<I>your_email_address</I>&gt;" in the file name.  The zip file is
to contain just a single Java file, properly documented, named
<CODE>Checkers_UI.java</CODE>.  The contents of this file are described
below.  Do not put anything else in the zip file.<p>

The project will be graded on a 10 point scale.  You may hand the
project in up to one week late, but there will be a penalty of 0.2
points (2%) for each day it is late.<p>

<B>The project will not be accepted for credit after the cutoff date of
October 13, 1998.</B><p>

<H2>Do Your Own Work</H2>

<blockquote><b>For this and all assignments in this course, you must
write and document your code yourself.  Furthermore, you must not make
code related to the assignment available to others in the course.  If I
discover that you have not followed either of these rules I will give
you a failing grade in the course and possibly request the college to
take disciplinary action.<p></b></blockquote>

If I assign you a failing grade in the course as a result of this policy
before the deadline date for dropping the course without evaluation, I will
request the Dean of Students to forbid you from dropping the course.  In
the past, the Dean has honored this sort of request.<p>

Actually, there is no point in trying to submit code that is not your
own because you will be tested on your ability to write code during
exams, and the exams will count much more than the projects in your
course grade.<p>

If you cannot write the code on your own, hand in what you can do
anyway; you will receive partial credit for your work.

<H2>Questions and Changes</H2>

There is a page with answers to [&nbsp;<a href="FAQ.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>&nbsp;] (FAQs) about the project.  Please consult
that page before sending me email about problems with the project.<p>

Rather than update this page when I make changes to the assignment or to
the code I am supplying to you, there is a separate web page for
[&nbsp;<a href="changes.html">Project Changes</a>&nbsp;].  I will send
email to everyone whenever there are changes.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

This is the first of three related projects.  In this one, you will
write a command-line, non-graphical, user interface for a checkers
playing program.  In the next project, you will write your own
implementation of the Checkerboard class (and related classes) that I
am supplying you for this project.  In the final project of the series,
you will develop a graphical user interface to replace the command line
interface you are writing for this project.<p>

If you do not know how to play checkers, you should consult [ <a
href="http://learn2.com/05/0501/0501.html">Learn2 Play Checkers</a>
].<p>

The program does not actually play checkers.  Rather, it provides a
Checkerboard and game pieces that can be used by two people playing
checkers or by someone who wants to study checkers problems.<p>

For this project, your program is to process the following command lines
entered by the user:

<blockquote> <dl>

    <dt><CODE>quit</CODE>
    <dd>Exit the program.<p>

    <dt><CODE>show</CODE>
    <dd>Prints a representation of the chessboard showing what squares
    are occupied by what pieces.<p>

    <dt><CODE>init</CODE>
    <dd>Puts all the pieces on the chessboard, positioned to start a new
    game.<p>

    <dt><CODE>clear</CODE>
    <dd>Remove all pieces from the chessboard.<p>
    
    <dt><CODE>place <I>piece</I> &lt;rc&gt; [<I>piece</I> &lt;rc&gt; ...]
    </CODE>

    <dd>Places a piece on the board at the indicated row/column.  The
    names of the pieces are <B>r</B> (red pawn), <B>R</B> (red king),
    <B>b</B> (black pawn), and <B>B</B> (black king).  For
    <CODE>&lt;rc&gt;</CODE>, the lower-left corner of the board is
    entered as <CODE>11</CODE>, the lower right corner is
    <CODE>18</CODE>, the upper-right corner is <CODE>88</CODE>, the
    upper-left corner is <CODE>81</CODE>, and so forth.<p>

    There can be any number of additional piece names and positions
    after the first pair.  This is indicated by the information inside
    the square brackets above.  The square brackets and the ellipses (
    <CODE>...</CODE> ) are not part of what the user actually types.<p>

    <dt><CODE>move  &lt;r<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub>&gt;
              &lt;r<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub>&gt;</CODE>
    <dd>Move a piece from
    <CODE>&lt;r<sub>1</sub>c<sub>1</sub>&gt;</CODE> to
    <CODE>&lt;r<sub>2</sub>c<sub>2</sub>&gt;</CODE>.<p>

    <dt><CODE>moves</CODE>
    <dd>Prints all the moves and jumps that each side can make legally.

</dl> </blockquote>

<H2>Development Steps</H2>

Follow the steps listed here to develop this project.  Be sure each
step works perfectly before starting work on the next step.  <I>If you
don't do the project by following these steps exactly, your tongue will
turn green and the bottoms of your feet will itch for the rest of your
life.</I>  And you will get neither sympathy, a deadline extension, nor a
decent grade from me.<p>

<ol>
    <li><B>Run My Code.</B>  I am supplying you with a complete, working
    implementation of the entire project.  Download the two files listed
    here, and run the program to see how the project works.<p>

    Create a directory to do the project in, and then download [ <a
    href="Vickery.zip">Vickery.zip</a> ].  You will probably have to
    right-click on this link and select "Save Link As ..." if you are
    using Netscape Navigator, or "Save Target As ..." if you are using
    Internet Explorer.  Select your project directory for the
    download.  You then need to use WinZip to unzip
    <CODE>Vickery.zip</CODE> and extract the two files in it,
    <CODE>Checkers_UI.class</CODE> and <CODE>Vickery.jar</CODE>.  If
    you have installed the WinZip Internet Extensions, you can just
    left-click on the Vickery.zip link, and WinZip will start up with
    the zip file opened and ready for you to extract Checkers_UI.class
    and Vickery.jar into your project directory.<p>

    To start running my version of the program, get a DOS prompt window,
    and type this command once:

    <blockquote><CODE>set CLASSPATH=.;Vickery.jar</CODE></blockquote>      

    That's an equal sign, a dot, and a semicolon, with no spaces, 
    between the H and the V.  It's good to capitalize the command as
    shown, but not necessary under Windows 95/98/NT.<p>

    Now run the program using the following command:

    <blockquote><CODE>java -nojit Checkers_UI</CODE></blockquote>

    If you are running a version of the JDK earlier than 1.1.6, omit the
    "<CODE>-nojit</CODE>" from this command line.  You should see a
    prompt message that says "<CODE>Command> </CODE>," and you should
    experiment with the various commands listed above to make sure you
    understand how to use the program.  Try entering badly formed
    commands to see what happens.  Report bugs to me!<p>
    
    <li><B>Implement the <CODE>quit</CODE> Command.</B>  Use your editor
    to create Checkers_UI.java, and define the class Checkers_UI.  Write
    a <I>main()</I> method that executes the following endless loop:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Write a prompt message, leaving the cursor on the same line as the
      message.<br>
      <li>Read a command line String from the user.
      <li>Create a StringTokenizer for the command line.
      <li>If there are any tokens and if the first token is "quit," exit
      the program.
      <li>If there are any tokens but the first token is not "quit," write
      an appropriate error message to stderr.
      <li>Repeat prompting, reading, and processing until the user types
      quit or signals end of file.
    </ul><p>

    <li><B>Implement the <CODE>show</CODE>, <CODE>init</CODE>, and
    <CODE>clear</CODE> Commands.</B>  The file <CODE>Vickery.jar</CODE>
    contains the class file for a class named
    <CODE>Checkerboard</CODE>. (It also includes a number of auxiliary class
    files that are used by <CODE>Checkerboard</CODE> and by my
    Checkers_UI class, but they do not concern you ... yet.)<p>
    Before you start the endless loop of prompting for commands and
    processing them, instantiate class Checkerboard once.  For purposes
    of discussion, let's assume you keep a refernce to this Checkerboard
    in a variable named <B>cb</B>.  Now you can add the following logic
    to your program's main loop:
    <ul>
      <li>If the command is "show," execute
      <CODE>System.out.println( cb );</CODE>
      <li>If the command is "init," execute <CODE>cb.init();</CODE>
      <li>If the command is "clear," execute <CODE>cb.zero();</CODE>
    </ul><p>

    <li><B>Implement the <CODE>move</CODE> Command.</B><p>

    If the command is "move," be sure there are exactly two more 
    tokens on the command line, and then try to convert those two 
    tokens to decimal numbers.  If you can do that, break each decimal 
    number into two decimal digits.  Then use the function 
    <I>validate()</I> provided by class Checkerboard to be sure each 
    row/column pair is actually on a valid square on the checkerboard.  
    The signature of this method looks like the 
    following:<blockquote><CODE>public boolean validate( int row, int 
    col )</CODE></blockquote>Like the other methods in class 
    Checkerboard, <I>validate()</I> works with row and column numbers 
    between zero and seven, so be sure to fix up the values given by 
    the user before calling this method.  It returns <i>true</i> if 
    the given row and column are the location of one of the black 
    squares of the checkerboard and returns <i>false</i> otherwise.<p>

    Once you have verified that the starting and ending squares are 
    valid, use Checkerboard's <i>pickUp()</i> method to (duh) pick up 
    the piece. The signature for <i>pickUp()</i> looks like the 
    following:<blockquote><code>public int pickUp( int row, int col ) 
    </code></blockquote>.  The value returned will be one of the 
    following five constants:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Checkerboard.NO_PIECE
      <li>Checkerboard.RED_PAWN 
      <li>Checkerboard.RED_KING
      <li>Checkerboard.BLACK_PAWN 
      <li>Checkerboard.BLACK_KING
    </ul><p>

    Use Checkerboard's <I>occupant()</I> method to find out what 
    piece, if any, occupies the target square.  <I>occupant()</I> has 
    the following signature:<blockquote><code>public int occupant( 
    row, col )</code></blockquote> and returns the same values as 
    <I>pickUp()</I>.  The only difference between the two methods is 
    that <I>pickUp()</I> removes the piece from the square, but 
    <I>occupant()</I> does not.<P>

    If the target square is not occupied, use <I>addPiece()</I> to put     
    the selected piece on the target square.  The signature for 
    <I>addPiece()</I> is: <blockquote><code>public boolean addPiece( 
    int piece, int row, int col ) </code></blockquote>  The first 
    argument should be one of the constants, RED_PAWN, RED_KING, 
    BLACK_PAWN, or BLACK_KING, which would have been returned by 
    <i>pickUp</i> earlier.  <i>addPiece()</i> has the feature that it 
    will allow you to add a RED_PAWN to a square already occupied by a 
    RED_PAWN to create a RED_KING, and likewise for black.<p>

    <li><B>Implement the <CODE>place</CODE> Command.</B><p>
    Implementing this command is optional, and how to do it is left 
    for you to work out.  However, if you do implement it, you must 
    use the methods already described for class Checkerboard.<p>

    <li><B>Implement the <CODE>moves</CODE> Command.</B><p> 
    Implementing this command is optional, and how to do it is left 
    for you to work out.  However, if you do implement it, you must 
    use the method <I>getMoves()</I> provided by the Checkerboard
    class. <I>getMoves()</I> has the following
    signature:<blockquote><CODE>public String
    getMoves()</CODE></blockquote>  The String returned will be a
    printable representation of all the moves and jumps available to
    both sides.  (I have not implemented <I>getMoves()</I>at this
    time!)<p>
