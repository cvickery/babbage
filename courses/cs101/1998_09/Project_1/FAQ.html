    <B>Question:</B> <I>I have downloaded "</I>Vickery.zip<I>" into a
    folder called <CODE>My&nbsp;Project&nbsp;1</CODE>, which is inside
    another folder called <CODE>cs-101&nbsp;Projects</CODE>. I have
    extracted </I>Checkers_UI.class<I> and </I>Vickery.jar<I> into
    <CODE>My&nbsp;Project&nbsp;1</CODE> folder. I went to the DOS
    prompt window and typed:
    "<CODE>set&nbsp;CLASSPATH=.;Vickery.jar</CODE>", pressed Enter, and
    the answer I got was "<CODE>C:\WINDOWS></CODE>" or I should say, I
    got no answer.  Then right after "<CODE>C:\WINDOWS></CODE>" I typed
    "<CODE>java Checkers_UI</CODE>" and the response was "<CODE>Can't
    find class Checkers_UI</CODE>".<BR> Why?, why?, why? please help
    me!.</I><p>

  <DD>

    <B>Answer:</B> OK, Vickery.jar and Checkers_UI.class are in
    <CODE>C:\cs-101&nbsp;Projects\My&nbsp;Project&nbsp;1</CODE>, but
    from your message, I see that your working directory was
    <CODE>C:\Windows</CODE>. Since everything else you said looks right
    (the <CODE>set</CODE> command doesn't print anything when you run
    it), the problem must be that you were in the wrong directory when
    you tried to run the program.<BR>You have to change to the directory
    where you put the files.  In your case, use the following command:

<pre>
   cd&nbsp;\cs-101&nbsp;Projects\My&nbsp;Project&nbsp;1
</pre>

    Then run the program from there.  The dot in the set CLASSPATH
    command refers to the "current directory," wherever that might be. 
    So you have use the <CODE>cd</CODE> (<I>change directory</I>)
    command to make the current directory be the one where
    Checkers_UI.class is in order for java to be able to find it. 
    Likewise, Vickery.jar also has to be in your current directory for
    java to be able to find that, too.

  <B>Question:</B>  <I>I've been trying to implement the move command,
  but when I compiled the following code the compiler gave me this
  error:</I><pre>Checkers_UI.java:73: No method matching validate()
  found in class Checkerboard.
                    cb.validate();
</pre><I>My code:</I><pre>
     ...    else if ( token.equalsIgnoreCase( "move" ) ) {

                             cb.validate();

                       }    ...
</pre><I>Is this code wrong? Could you please give me a hand?</I><p>

  <DD>
    <B>Answer:</B> You have to pass the row and column numbers (0-7) as
  arguments. The message means that there is no method matching
  "validate()" with empty parentheses.  But there <I>is</I> one that matches
  "validate(int, int)".<p>

  <DT><B>Question: </B><I>Hi, I am trying to work with your "move"
command in Checkers_UI but it is not working. When I type "move" it
prints "</I><CODE>usage: move&lt;from&gt;&lt;to&gt;</CODE><I>". So if I
then type "</I><CODE>move<3 1><4 2></CODE><I>" or
"</I><CODE>&lt;31&gt;&lt;42&gt;</CODE><I>" none of them works. Both of
them gave me error messages. Please help
me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</I>

  <DD><B>Answer: </B>Don't type any angle brackets, type a space to
  separate <I>move</I> from the two numbers, and a space separating the
  two numbers.  No spaces inside the two numbers.  Remember, this is
  being parsed by a StringTokenizer, and should turn into three tokens. 
  The angle brackets in the handout are a fairly standard way to show
  "type something here that is described by the word inside the
  brackets; don't type the brackets."  Sample command:
<pre>  move 33 44</pre>

  <DT><B>Question: </B>

<I>I'm having trouble with my project. I feel like I'm on the right
track but
I can't see to figure out exactly when to refer to the checkerboard
piece
variables RED_PAWN, BLACK_PAWN, ETC.
So far my code compiles and executes all other commands...
BUT IT JUST WONT   " *^*&&^^%&% " MOVE!!!!<p>

ps.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.   I must learn to display better
control.

    <B>Answer: </B>As long as you don't say "#@$" it's OK.<p>

I would approach it incrementally (green tongue, and all that).<p>

First, get two row/column pairs and use <I>cb.validate()</I> (twice) to
make sure they are on the board.  I just looked at my code and saw that
I didn't make this method static (which I should have), so you have to
use an instance variable to call it -- cb in the sentence above.<p>

Now, use <I>cb.pickUp()</I> to pick up piece on the first square, and
then call <I>cb.addPiece()</I> to place it on the second square.  None
of this needs any references to RED_PAWN, etc.  However, if you do
"move 33 44" it should work.  pickUp will return an <I>int</I> that
will be equal to one of the RED_PAWN, etc. constants, but you don't
really need to look at that value yet; just use it as the first
argument when you call <I>addPiece()</I>.<p>

Then you can start getting fancy.  If <I>pickUP()</I> returns
Checkerboard.NO_PIECE (aka cb.NO_PIECE) the first square was empty, so
print an error message. Next, if the value returned by
<I>cb.occupant()</I> of the second square is *not*
Checkerboard.NO_PIECE, that means the user tried to move to a non-empty
square, which is also an error, so print an error message.<p>

Once you have all that working, you can start to do the "interesting"
stuff.  To check for valid moves, you have to look at the value
returned by <I>pickUp()</I>.  If it is a RED_PAWN, the piece has to
move down the board (the row number of the second square must be one
less than the row number of the first square).  Vice-versa for
BLACK_PAWN.  The second column number has to be first column number,
plus or minus exactly one. If the second square's row  number is the
piece's king row and the piece is a pawn, you can use <I>addPiece()</I>
to add the piece to itself, thereby making it a king.<p>  Then you can do
jumps :-)<p>
