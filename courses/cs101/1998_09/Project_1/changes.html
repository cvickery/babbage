<H1>Project 1 Changes</H1>
</center>

This page chronicles the changes to [&nbsp;<a href="index.html">the web
page for Project 1</a>&nbsp;].  The idea is to put new material here so
you don't have to deal with the entire assignment page just to see what
is different.  Significant change listed here will also be emailed to
everyone in the class.<p>

<H2>October 2</H2>

I have updated [&nbsp;<a href="Vickery.zip">Vickery.zip</a>&nbsp;] to
"Beta 4."  I added code to catch NumberFormatExceptions thrown when the
user types a non-numeric value on the move command, and have fixed my
move command so that it recognizes jumps as well as moves.<p>

I added the following methods to class Checkerboard:

<pre>
    public static boolean isMove( int piece,
                                  int r1, int c1,
                                  int r2, int c2);
    public static boolean isJump( int piece,
                                  int r1, int c1,
                                  int r2, int c2);
</pre>

These two methods assume that r1, c1, r2, and c2 are all between 0 and
7, and that piece is RED_PAWN, RED_KING, BLACK_PAWN, or BLACK_KING. 
They return "true" if the two squares have the correct relationship
between each other to be a valid move or jump, respectively.  They do
not check whether the starting and ending squares are occupied or not,
and <I>isJump()</I> does not check whether the square being jumped is
occupied by a piece of the opposite color or not.<p>

In class last night, I said that your Project 1 is required only to work
correctly for correct input.  I have to change that to, "Your Project 1
is required to work correctly for any correct input.  In addition, it
must be able to handle invalid command names and invalid arguments for
the move command."  Sorry about that; I shouldn't try to figure out
things like that while in front of the class.<p>

This isn't a "FAQ," but it is a common enough problem that I'd like to
mention it here:
<blockquote>Your program must not create a new BufferedReader for each
command that it reads.  If you do that, it will generally appear to work
all right, but it will fail if the input lines do not come from the
keyboard.  In particular, I will use a program to help me test your
program, and my program will send commands to your program using a
mechanism like I/O redirection ( &lt; ), which will not work if your
program creates a new BufferedReader each time it reads a command line.
</blockquote>
In other words, instantiate your BufferedReader <I>outside</I> your while
loop.

<H2>September 27</H2>

A student reported that my Checkers_UI does not always respond to
commands until he pressed <CODE>&lt;Enter&gt;</CODE> several times.  I
have not been able to reproduce the problem, but this behavior is
symptomatic of an "output buffering" problem.  So, I added the
following statement after each <CODE>System.out.print(...)</CODE>
statement in my Checkers_UI.java:<pre>  System.out.flush();</pre>
I uploaded the code to [&nbsp;<a
href="Vickery.zip">Vickery.zip</a>&nbsp;].  The new code announces
itself as "Vickery Beta 3."

<H2>September 26</H2>

The [&nbsp;<a href="Vickery.zip">Vickery.zip</a>&nbsp;] file has been
updated.  Many of the changes are in my <CODE>Checkers_UI.class</CODE>,
so they don't really affect the project, but there are some changes to
the Checkerboard class too.<p>
<ol>
  <li> The method that checks if a row/column pair is on a black square
  on the board is named <I>validate()</I>, not <I>verify()</I> as
  originally stated in the project assignment.  The web page has been
  changed to correct this.  There is no change to any code; this is just
  a documentation fix.
  <li> The original assignment was vague about what the <I>move</I>
  command does.  I will divide this into what is <I>required</I> and
  what is <I>optional.</I>
  <dl>

    <dt><I>Required:</I>
    <dd>The program must make sure the user enters exactly two arguments
    after the command name, it must make sure the two arguments are
    valid decimal numbers, it must make sure the two numbers specify the
    coordinates of a black square on the chessboard, it must make sure
    there is a piece to pick up at the starting square, and it must make
    sure the destination square is empty.  If any of these tests fails,
    the board must not be changed.  If they all succeed, the program is
    to update the board by removing the piece from the starting square
    and depositing it on the destination square.

    <dt><I>Optional:</I>

    <dd>You can do any, all, or none of the following.  If you do any
    of them, you can get extra credit to offset points lost elsewhere
    in the project.  However, uou cannot get extra credit to give you
    more than 100% (10 points) for the project.<p>

    Make sure the move is legal according to the rules of checkers. 
    (Black pawns must move one square at a time towards row 7, and red
    pieces must move one row at a time towards row 0.) If a pawn makes
    it to its king row, promote the piece to king by adding another
    pawn to it, and allow it to move backwards.  Process jumps
    correctly.  (A piece may move two rows provided there is a piece of
    the opposite color on the intervening square; the jumped piece is
    removed from the board.  (My program does not handle jumps yet.)<p>

    To help you with the optional parts, I have added the following
    methods to class Checkerboard:
    <ul>

      <li> <CODE>public&nbsp;static&nbsp;int&nbsp;kingRow(&nbsp;int&nbsp;);</CODE>
      <BR>The argument is a piece, and the value returned is 7 if the
      piece is black, and 0 otherwise.

      <li> <CODE>public&nbsp;static&nbsp;boolean&nbsp;isBlack(&nbsp;int&nbsp;);</CODE> 
      <BR>Returns true if the argument is a black pawn or a black king, and
      false otherwise.

      <li> <CODE>public&nbsp;static&nbsp;boolean&nbsp;isPawn(&nbsp;int&nbsp;);</CODE>
      <BR>Returns true if the argument is a red pawn or a black pawn, and
      false otherwise.

    </ul>
  </dl>

  <li> My Checkerboard_UI now prints a message when it starts up telling
  what version it is.  Right now, the message says, "This is Vickery
  Beta 2."  The previous version of <CODE>Vickery.zip</CODE> either
  printed no message (if you downloaded it right after I put it up), or
  "This is Vickery Beta 1."

  <li> My program does not handle <I>place</I> commands at all, and it
  does not handle <I>moves</I> commands properly ... yet.
