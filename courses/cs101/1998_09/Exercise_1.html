<H1>CS-101 Exercise 1, Fall 1998</H1>
</center>

<H2>Due Date</H2>
This exercise is due on <B>September 15, 1998</B>.
<H2>Deliverables</H2>

Write a public class named <CODE>Main</CODE> which contains the static
method <I>main()</I>.  The <I>main()</I> method is to instantiate
another public class named <CODE>Exercise_1</CODE> three times.  Then,
<I>main()</I> is to call public <CODE>Exercise_1</CODE>'s member method
<I>which_instance()</I> twice for each instance.  Each time
<I>which_instance()</I> is called, it prints the message, "This is
instance number <I>n</I>." with <I>n</I> set to the number 1, 2, or 3
as the case may be.<p>

Use the [ <a href="Lecture_Notes_1/SampleCode.html">Sample Code</a> ]
from [ <a href="Lecture_Notes_1">Lecture 1</a> ] as a guide for how to
document the code.<p>

After testing your code to be sure it works properly, put
<CODE>Main.java</CODE> <I>and</I> <CODE>Exercise_1.java</CODE> into
<I>one</I> zip file,
and email it to Dr. Vickery (<CODE>vickery@qc.edu</CODE>) by midnight
on the due date.  The zip file may have any name you choose, but the
files in the zip file must be named exactly as indicated.<p>

If you don't know how to create a zip file, look at [ <a
href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Development_Tools.html#winzip">
the Development Tools web page</a> ] for information.

<H2>Source Code</H2>

The code for this exercise was given in class.  You can see an
undocumented copy of the code at [ <a
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Fall98/Lecture_Notes_4"/>
this page</a> ].  Be sure you type in the code and document it properly
yourself for this exercise.<p>
