<H2>Sample Questions</H2>

Note: Questions that ask you to "explain" things or to "tell how" will
be made into multiple-choice, true/false, or fill-in questions on the
exam.

<ol>

  <LI>Write an application that displays a Frame with a "Dismiss" button
  in it.  When the user clicks on the button or on the close-window (x)
  button, the application terminates.  Use separate classes for the
  action listener and the window listener.

  <LI>Repeat the previous question using inner classes for the listeners.

  <LI>Repeat the previous question using anonymous classes for the
  listeners. [&nbsp;<a href="ClickAndDie_3.html">Solution</A>&nbsp;]
  
  <LI>Explain the difference between listeners and adapters.  Relate
  your answer to subclasses and interfaces.

  <LI>Write an application that displays a square grid of Panels that
  adjusts its size to the size of a Frame that contains the grid, but
  which retains its squareness regardless of the shape of the Frame that
  contains the grid.

  <LI>Write an application that displays a Panel.  Each time the user
  clicks the mouse inside the panel, it changes color.  Successive
  clicks change the color from red to green to blue to white to black,
  and then the cycle of colors starts over again. [&nbsp;<a
  href="ColorCycle.html">Solution</a>&nbsp;]

  <LI>Name a method that will work if it is executed by an application
  but not by an applet running in a web browser.

  <LI>Tell how these methods are related to each other:
  <I>repaint()</I>, <I>update()</I>, <I>clearRect()</I>, and
  <I>paint()</I>

  <LI>Explain the relationship between a layout manager and the
  <I>validate()</I> method.  Relate this answer to the previous
  question.  

  <LI>Write the code for a class that makes a component's foreground
  color change periodically. [&nbsp;<a
  href="Blinker.html">Solution</a>&nbsp;]

  <LI>What are the similarities and differences between a MenuBar, a
  Menu, and a MenuItem?

  <LI>Which is the more appropriate listener to add to a Button, a
  MouseListener, a MouseMotionListener, a WindowListener, or an
  ActionListener?

  <LI>Which would be more appropriate to add to a Panel, a MouseListener
  or an ActionListener?
