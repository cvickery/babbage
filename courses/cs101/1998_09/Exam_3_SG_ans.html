1 through 3.  The syllabus page has a link from Lecture 24 that shows how to
set up mouse and window listeners.  To see how to hook an ActionListener
to a Button, see the answer to question 3.<P>

4.  A listener is an interface that specifies a set of methods that will
be called when various events occur.  If you want your program to
respond to any of these events, you could write a class that implements
the listener's interface, but you have to provide implemenations of
<I>all</I> of the methods in the interface.  An adapter is a class that
provides do-nothing implementations of all the methods in an interface.
If you are interested in just one type of event, you could extend the
adapter class and override just that method (or those methods) that you
are interested in.  For example, the WindowListener interface specifies
seven different events.  If you are interested only in WindowClosing
events, you could subclass the WindowAdapter class and implement just
the windowClosing method and not bother with the other six methods.<P>

5.  This code was given in class and is part of the third project, which
you should be writing yourself.<P>

6.  Follow the link from the Study Guide page.<P>

7.  System.exit()<P>

8.  You can get a component redrawn on the screen by calling its
<I>repaint()</I> method, which requests the AWT to call the component's
<I>update</I> method.  The default implementation of <I>update()</I>
calls <I>clearRect()</I> to re-draw the component's background, and then
calls the component's <I>paint()</I> method to re-draw its
foreground.<P>

9.  You can get a container's layout manager to recompute the geometry
of all the components in the container and then to repaint them all by
calling the container's <I>validate()</I> method.  In Project 3, this is
one way of getting all the BlackSquares to re-paint themselves.<P>

10.  Follow the link from the Study Guide page.<P>

11.  A Frame or Dialog may have exactly one MenuBar.  A MenuBar may have
any number of Menus, which are added to the MenuBar using the MenuBar's
<I>add()</I> method.  A MenuBar can have exactly one Help Menu, which is
added to the MenuBar using <I>setHelpMenu()</I> instead of <I>add()</I>.
Manus can contain other Menus and/or MenuItems.  A MenuItem is a
component that you can attach an ActionListener to; when the user clicks
on a MenuItem, its <I>actionPerformed()</I> method will be called.<P>

12.  An ActionListener.<P>

13.  A MouseListener.<P>
