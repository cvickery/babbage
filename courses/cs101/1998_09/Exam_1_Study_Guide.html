<H1 align=center>CS-101 Exam 1 Study Guide</H1>
<H2 align=center>October 8, 1998</H2>
<H2>Note: You will be assigned a seat for the exam, so arrive early in
order to have time to find your seat assignment.</H2>

<P>The exam will be based on lectures, as well as Chapters 6 and 14 in
the textbook. There will be no questions based directly on chapters
1-5, but you are expected to know that material already.</P>

<P>Some material that was covered in class is not covered in the
textbook. In particular, the material on the [&nbsp;<A
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Fall98/Lecture_Notes_3">Java
Virtual Machine&nbsp;</A>]. Go to the [&nbsp;<A
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Fall98/Syllabus.html#syllabus">Syllabus
Page</A>&nbsp;] for the course to get those and additional lecture
notes.</P>

<P>You should also be familiar with the operation of the JDK
development tools, and described in the [&nbsp;<A
HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Development_Tools.html">Development
Tools</A>&nbsp;] web page.</P>

<P>You should be able to write class and method definitions equivalent
to the sample code covered in class.</P>

<P>In particular you should be able to answer questions like the
following:</P><DIR>

<DIR>

<P>"Write a static method named <I>square()</I> that receives a two-dimensional array of Objects and returns a boolean value indicating whether the array has the same number of columns in each row as the number of rows, or not."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>or</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Write a static method named <I>longest()</I> that receives an array of Strings, and returns the longest one."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>or</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Class Character provides a method with the following signature:</P>
<P>&#9;<FONT FACE="Courier New">public static boolean isUpperCase(char ch)</P>
</FONT><P>Write a static method named <I>uppity()</I> that receives a two-dimensional array of <I>char</I> and returns a <I>double</I> between 0 and 1.0 that tells what proportion of the arrray contains upper-case characters."</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>You should be able to write code that uses a StringTokenizer to process lines read using a BufferedReader. You should be able to use Integer.parseInt(), and you should be able to manage any exceptions it might throw.</P>
<P>For example:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Write an application that reads lines from the user. The user should type a list of integer numbers, separated by spaces. The program should print an error message if the user types anything but numbers, but should continue processing the remainder of the user’s input even if there is an error. When the user types <FONT FACE="Courier New">^Z</FONT>, the program prints the valid numbers from each line, with each line preceeded by its sum followed by a colon.</P>
<P>Sample session. Computer output is <B><FONT FACE="Courier New">boldface</FONT>,</B> user’s input is <FONT FACE="Courier New">monospaced<B>.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Enter a line: </B>123 456</P>
<B><P>Enter a line:</B> 987 oops! 12 19</P>
<B><P>Error: "oops!" is not a number.</P>
<P>Enter a line: </B>^Z</P>
<B><P>Your lines and their sums were:</P>
<P>579: 123 456</P>
<P>1018: 987 12 19</P></DIR>
