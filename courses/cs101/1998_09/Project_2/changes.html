<H1>Project 2 Changes</H1>
</center>

This page chronicles the changes to [&nbsp;<a href="index.html">the web
page for Project 2</a>&nbsp;].  The idea is to put new material here so
you don't have to deal with the entire assignment page just to see what
is different.  Significant change listed here will also be emailed to
everyone in the class.<p>

<H2>November 27</H2>

  I said in class on Tuesday the 24th that I would send everyone the
  code for Checkerboard.<I>isMove()</I> and
  Checkerboard.<I>isJump()</I>.  After class, the people who had
  implemented these methods on their own, or with the algorithms I gave
  in the assignment's web page, pointed out that they wouldn't get any
  more credit for their work than someone else who just handed in my
  code.  They are right, so here's how I will work it:  If you want the
  code that I offered in class on the 24th, send me a request by email,
  and I will send my code for the methods to you, as promised.  On the
  other hand, if you implement these methods yourself, don't ask for
  them, and mention that you did them yourself when you submit the
  project.  I'll give extra credit (replacement for some of the points
  lost elsewhere in the project) to those who implements the methods
  themselves.
