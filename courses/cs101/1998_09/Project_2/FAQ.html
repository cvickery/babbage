    <B>Question:</B> <I> After I finished Square.java, it compiled OK,
        but something is wrong when I enter a list command.  The message is:
<pre>
The following squares are occupied:
[8][8]: rCommand: java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Square: method getNext()LSquare; not found
    at CB_List.process(Compiled Code)
    at Checkers_UI.main(Compiled Code)
</pre>
     What's wrong with it?</I><p>

  <DD>

    <B>Answer:</B> The synopsis for class <CODE>Square</CODE> lists all
    the public methods, which you must supply.  Apparently you
    didn't provide:

<pre>
  public Square getNext()
</pre>

    The error message uses the string "<CODE>getNext()LSquare</CODE>"
    which you interpret as follows: The method name is
    <CODE>getNext</CODE>, the empty parentheses indicate that the
    method receives no arguments, and the <CODE>LSquare</CODE>
    indicates that the method returns a reference to an object of
    c<B>L</B>ass <CODE>Square</CODE>.<p>

    <B>Question:</B> <I>Could you please tell me as much as you will
    about Square.java.  Obviously I got it wrong on the exam.  You
    threw it again in class and I didn't catch it then either.</I><p>

  <DD>

    <B>Answer:</B> First, the overview:  I wanted to give you some
    practice working with linked lists, so I decided to do it for the
    <CODE>list</CODE> and <CODE>moves</CODE> commands, by having
    methods that return linked lists of all the occupied squares and
    all the possible moves respectively.  The way Java works, these
    lists have to be lists of objects, so I invented the classes Square
    and Move to hold the items on these lists.<p>

    The key thing about both these classes is that they hold all the
    information about an occupied square or a possible move/jump, such
    as what position(s) on the board is/are involved, what piece is
    occupying the (starting) square, and for class Move a boolean that
    tells whether the move involves jumping another piece or not.  In
    addition, both classes provide a "next" field to hold a link to the
    next item on a linked list.<p>

    Both classes demonstrate encapsulation by making all fields
    private, but with public methods that allow methods from other
    classes to get or set the values of the private fields.<p>
    
    Perhaps the key method in both classes is the <I>toString()</I>
    method, that returns a printable String representing the
    information stored in the object about the square or move.  The
    <CODE>list</CODE> and <CODE>moves</CODE> commands traverse the
    lists returned by Checkerboard.<I>getBoardList()</I> and
    Checkerboard.<I>getMoves()</I>, appending the Strings returned by
    these methods to the Strings that are actually printed as the output
    of the commands.<p>
    
    Of course, what I think you really are asking is how to write the
    code for these two classes.  So here is the code for Square, with a
    few details left out for you to fill in.  Once you have this, it
    should be pretty clear how to do class Move, because they are so
    similar.

<pre>
    public class Square implements Piece {

    //  Declare private ints for row, column, and piece here.

    //  Declare a private Square named next for use in linked lists
    //  here.

    //  Define two constructors here.  The first one receives values
    //  for row, column, and piece, and the second one receives values
    //  for these three plus the "next" Square.  The constructors both
    //  have check that the row and column values are between 0 and 7
    //  and that the value for piece is one of RED_PAWN, RED_KING,
    //  BLACK_PAWN, or BLACK_KING.  If not, the constructor is to
    //  throw a new CBException with an appropriate messessage.  (As
    //  the synopsis shows, the constructors have to be declared with
    //  "throws CBException" because of this.)

    //  Because the two constructors have to do the same checks on the
    //  row, column, and piece, I decided to write a separate method
    //  that they both could call to do the actuall checking and
    //  assignment of values to the private variables. I called this
    //  method <I>initSquare()</I>.  You don't have to do that if you
    //  don't want to.  You could write all that code twice instead if
    //  you prefer.  Anyway, here is the code for one of my
    //  constructors:
    
        public Square( int row, int column, int piece ) 
          throws CBException {
          initSquare( row, column, piece, null );
          }

    //  Define public methods to get (return) the values of the
    //  private integer variables here.  Also provide a method to
    //  return the value of <I>next</I> and one to set the value of
    //  <I>next</I>.  The names of these methods are given in the
    //  synopsis for the class.
    
    //  Define the <I>toString()</I> method for the class here.  It
    //  could end with a line something like the following:

          return "[" +  (row + 1) + "][" +
                        (col + 1) + "]: " + pieceString;

    //  Here, <I>pieceString</I> is a String variable, local to the
    //  <I>toString()</I> method, to which you have assigned the
    //  value "r" if <I>piece</I> is a <CODE>RED_PAWN</CODE>, "R" if
    //  <I>piece</I> is a <CODE>RED_KING</CODE>, etc.

    } // class Square

  <DT><B>Question: </B><I>I am getting a run-time error.
<pre>
C:\Project Area\Project Checker#2>java Checkers_UI

java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: Checkerboard: method &lt;init&gt;()V not found
        at Checkers_UI.main(Compiled Code)
</pre>
Yet in my Checkerboard java file I have the following method for init --
what could I be doing wrong?
<pre>
    public void init() { ...
</pre>
</I>  

  <DD><B>Answer: </B> When the error message puts "init" in angle
      brackets, it means the constructor for the class, not your
      <I>init()</I> method.  So, <CODE>&lt;init&gt;()V</CODE> means
      "<I>the constructor for the class that receives no arguments
      </I>(that's the empty parentheses)<I> and returns void
      </I>(that's the V even though constructors technically don't have
      a return type)."  I would guess that you have written a
      Checkerboard constructor that does take an argument (but I don't
      know why you would) in which case the compiler does not
      automatically generate a no-arg constructor for you.  So put in a
      no-arg constructor, even if it doesn't do anything.
