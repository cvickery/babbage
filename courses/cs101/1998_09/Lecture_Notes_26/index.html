<H2>Color</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Pixels and Phosphor Triads
  <LI>Additive Primaries (mixing lights): Red, Green, Blue
  <LI>Subtractive Primaries (mixing pigments): Cynan, Magenta, Yellow
  <LI>java.awt.Color
  <UL>

    <LI>Predefined Color objects: red, green, blue, cyan, magenta,
    yellow, black, darkGray, gray, lightGray, white, pink and orange.<BR>
    Beware of different computers' capabilities for distinguishing among
    different colors.

    <LI>Constructors: Pass three integers (0 - 255) or floats ( 0 - 1.0
    ) giving intensities of red, green, and blue comonents to create
    your own Color.  Floats will be scaled to integer values between 0
    and 255.

    <LI>Methods: <I>brighter()</I> and <I>darker()</I> return new Color
    objects based on an existing Color.

    <LI>Related Methods: Use <I>setColor()</I> to set the drawing color
    (foreground color), typically inside a <I>paint()</I> method for a
    component. [&nbsp;<I>e.g.,</I> <CODE>gc.setColor( Color.red
    );</CODE>&nbsp;]  Use <I>setBackground()</I> to fill the background of a
    container, such as a Panel, with a color. [&nbsp;<I>e.g.,</I>
    <CODE>myPanel.setBackground( Color.white );</CODE>&nbsp;]

<H2>Inner Classes</H2>

You can define one class inside another one.  For example,

<PRE>
  class x { . . . class y { ... } }
</PRE>

This will generate a class file named <CODE>x$y.class</CODE>.  If a
class is a "helper" class for just one public class, it may legitimately
be coded as an inner class.  If it seems to make sense to put more than
one class in a single .java file, classes other than the public one are
reasonable candidates for being written as inner classes.

<H2>Anonymous Classes</H2>

Often you need to extend a class just to override one method with a
line or two of code.  Java lets you define classes with no name for
doing this sort of thing with a minimum of fuss.  To do it, you write a
class definition without the keyword <I>class</I> or any of its
modifiers right after a reference to a constructor for the class that
you want to extend.

<PRE>
    WindowListener wl = new WindowListener() {
      public void windowClosing( WindowEvent we ) {
        System.exit( 0 );
        } }
</PRE>

The outer pair of braces enclose the anonymous class' definition, which
contains one method definition.  There will be a class file with the
name of the enclosing class, a dollar sign, and the digit zero.  If you
have multiple anonymous classes, they will have different numbers after
the dollar sign in their names.

<H2>Dialog</H2>

Dialog is a Window that has a title bar with just one button on the
right side, the one for closing it.  A Dialog has to belong to a Frame,
called its <I>parent.</I>  If the parent is minimized (iconified),
deiconified, or closed, the Dialog is too.  The construtor must be
passed a reference to the parent, and may optionally be given a
titlebar String and a boolean telling if it is modal.  A modal dialog
is one that prevents the user from interacting with other parts of the
GUI while it is visible.  You make a Dialog appear on the screen by
calling its <I>show()</I> method, and you make it disappear (normally
when the user clicks the close button in the titlebar or clicks a
button inside the Dialog) by calling its <I>dispose()</I> method.  (It
inherits these methods from class Window.)

<H2>Menu</H2>

A <CODE>Menu</CODE> holds <CODE>MenuItem</CODE>s.  When the user clicks
on a Menu, a list of its MenuItems drops down, and the user can select
one by clicking on it.  When a MenuItem is selected, its
ActionListener's <I>actionPerformed()</I> method is called.  Menus can
contain other Menus as well as MenuItems.  You add a Menu or MenuItem to
a Menu using the <I>add()</I> method.<p>

A Frame may optionally have a <CODE>MenuBar</CODE>, which appears as a
horizontal strip under its title bar.  You use <I>add()</I> to add any
number of Menus to a MenuBar, except that there can be no more than one
"Help" menu.  You use <I>setHelpMenu()</I> to add the Help menu to a
MenuBar.

<H2><I>list()</I></H2>

The classes <CODE>Component</CODE> and <CODE>Container</CODE> both
provide a <I>list()</I> method that can be very useful for debugging. 
It prints information about the Component, and if the Component is a
Container, it prints information about all the objects contained in the
container.

The sample code illustrates the use of a MenuItem to display a Dialog.
