<H2>Notes</H2>
The following code was used to show various features of window and mouse
event procesing.<p>
<OL>

  <li>A <CODE>Frame</CODE> is a Java class that provides a window with
  a title bar and other <I>decorations</I> provided by the operating
  system's <I>window manager.</I>  The MS Windows window manager
  provides decorations that include buttons to minimize, maximize, and
  close a Frame.

  <li>You have to write code to get the "close window" button to do
  anything.

  <li>Event listeners are interfaces, that are added to graphical
  objects, such as Frames.  The class that implements the interface may
  be the same class as the one that generates the graphical object, or
  it may be a different class.

  <LI>Event adapters are classes that implement an interface with
  methods that don't do anything.  You can extend an adapter class and
  override just the methods you want to actually implement.

  <LI>Java calls minimizing a window "iconifying" it.

  <LI>Each event listener method receives an object that contains
  information about the event.  Classes <CODE>MouseEvent</CODE>,
  <CODE>KeyEvent</CODE>, and <CODE>WindowEvent</CODE> provide methods
  for getting at that information for mouse, keyboard, and window
  events.  We looked at some of the MouseEvent information.

  <LI>Bit masks are numbers that have just one bit set (equal to one)
  in them.  You can use the <B>&amp;</B> operator to tell if an int has
  the bit corresponding to a bit in a mask set.  Example:

<pre>
public void mouseClicked( MouseEvent me ) {
int mods = me.getModifiers();
  if ( (mods & InputEvent.BUTTON3_MASK) != 0 )
    System.out.println( "Button 3" );
}
</pre>
