<H2>Sample Questions</H2>

<ol>

  <LI>  Write an interface named Piece that defines named integer
  constants, NO_PIECE, RED_PAWN, RED_KING, BLACK_PAWN, and BLACK_KING
  that have numeric values 1, 3, 5, 7, and -12 respectively.  What
  would be the reason for a class to implement this interface?

  <LI>  Fields in interfaces are implicitly public, static and final. 
  (T/F).
  <LI>  Interfaces cannot be extended. (T/F)
  <LI>  Interfaces may include default definitions for methods. (T/F)
  <LI>  Abstract classes may not be extended. (T/F)
  <LI>  Abstract classes may include method definitions. (T/F)
  <LI>  Abstract classes may not be instantiated.  (T/F)

  <LI>  Other T/F questions based on the [&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Fall98/Classes_AbstractClasses_Interfaces.html">Classes,
  Abstract Classes, and Interfaces</A>&nbsp;] summary chart.

  <LI>  Define a class named Book that provides methods named
  getNext() and setNext(), and constructor that accepts a reference to a
  Book object and a String.  Include the appropriate method in this
  class so that the following code will print the String that was passed
  to the constructor:
  <pre>
      Book b = new Book( null, "Joy of Cooking");
      System.out.println("The book is " + b );
  </pre>

  <LI>  Write a complete application that creates a linked list of Book
  objects using titles that the user types in.  The user may enter as
  many titles as desired, one per line.  Typing ^Z causes the program
  to print all the titles entered, and then to terminate.

  <LI>  Explain the use of the Hashtable named dispatchTable in my
  [&nbsp;<a
  HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/Fall98/Project_1/HTML/Checkers_UI.html
  ">Checkers_UI.java</A>&nbsp;].

  <LI>  Modify the constructor for class Book so that it uses a
  Hashtable to determine if there is already a Book with the same title
  as the one being given as the second argument.  Have the constructor
  throw a DuplicateException when this happens.  You have to write the
  code for class DuplicateException.
