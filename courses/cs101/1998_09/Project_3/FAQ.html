    <B>Question:</B> <I>Why doesn't my board show the change when
    I call </I>cb.init()<I> and </I>cb.zero()<I> in the
    </I>actionPerformed()<I> methods for my buttons?</I><p>

  <DD>

    <B>Answer:</B> I gave some bad advice in class, suggesting that you
    could just call the <I>validate()</I> method for the Panel that
    holds all the squares.  That does work for my program, but I'm not
    sure why!  Calls to a container's <I>validate()</I> method are
    supposed to be ignored if the container or its contents haven't
    changed size.  Instead, you should loop through all the black square
    Panels, and call their <I>repaint()</I> method to get them to show
    whatever piece they are supposed to have on them.  There are
    optimizations you could do to reduce the number of method calls you
    have to make, but this technique works and I don't think you will
    see any effect of the extra overhead.  You will need to use this
    technique when you start moving pieces, too.<p>
