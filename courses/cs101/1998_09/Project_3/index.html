<H1>Project 3: Checkerboard GUI</H1>
</center>
<H2>Due Date and Deliverables</H2>

This project is due by <B>midnight December 22, 1998</B>.<p>
<B>The project will not be accepted for credit after the cutoff date of
December 22, 1998.</B><p>

Send me a zip file containing the following files:
<CODE><UL>
    <LI>Checkers_GUI.java
    <LI>Any additional Java source files needed by your project.
</UL>
</CODE>

Do not send any other files.  In particular, I will take care of
putting <CODE>Vickery_CB.jar</CODE> from Project 2 in the same
directory as your Java files when I compile and run your project.  You
are not to send any Jar or Class files in your zip file.  The zip file
may have any valid file name you wish, so long as it has a
<CODE>.zip</CODE> extension.  Be sure to put your own name in the email
message you send when you submit the project.<p>

When your submit your project, put a list of any required features you
have not implemented or any optional features that you have implemented
in the body of the message.  (There must be just one list; see the
Project Description.) Put your name at the end of the message.<p>

The project will be graded on a 10 point scale.<p>

<H2>Do Your Own Work</H2>

<blockquote><b>For this and all assignments in this course, you must
write and document your code yourself.  Furthermore, you must not make
code related to the assignment available to others in the course.  If I
discover that you have not followed either of these rules I will give
you a failing grade in the course and possibly request the college to
take disciplinary action.<p></b></blockquote>

If I assign you a failing grade in the course as a result of this policy
before the deadline date for dropping the course without evaluation, I will
request the Dean of Students to forbid you from dropping the course.  In
the past, the Dean has honored this sort of request.<p>

Actually, there is no point in trying to submit code that is not your
own because you will be tested on your ability to write code during
exams, and the exams will count much more than the projects in your
course grade.<p>

If you cannot write the code on your own, hand in what you can do
anyway; you will receive partial credit for your work.

<H2>Questions and Changes</H2>

There is a page with answers to [&nbsp;<a href="FAQ.html">Frequently
Asked Questions</a>&nbsp;] (FAQs) about the project.  Please consult
that page before sending me email about problems with the project.<p>

Rather than update this page when I make changes to the assignment or to
the code I am supplying to you, there is a separate web page for
[&nbsp;<a href="changes.html">Project Changes</a>&nbsp;].  I will send
email to everyone whenever there are changes.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

This is the third of three related projects.  In the first one, you
wrote a command-line, non-graphical, user interface for a checkers
playing program.  In the second one  you will wrote your own
implementation of the Checkerboard class (and related classes).  In
this, the final project of the series, you will develop a graphical
user interface to replace the command line interface.<p>

As for the first two projects, I recommend very highly that you do the
project in a sequence of development steps.  People who did not follow
this advice for the first two projects and tried to do the whole thing at
once have, in general, had to drop the course and seek professional help.<p>

For this project, the "steps" are given as a list of requirements.  To
get full credit for the project, your program has to meet all the
requirements that say "must" in them.  The requirements that say
"should" are suggestions.  If you want to do the "should" things
differently you can still get full credit for the project provided your
project implements something equivalent to them.  Requirements that are
listed as "optional" are just that.  You can get <I>more than full
credit</I> for this project by implementing optional parts, <I>provided
you also implement all requirements and "shoulds."</I>  You will
receive <U>no</U> extra credit if your don't do all the requirements
and "shoulds."<p>

<OL>


  <H3><LI>Must Be Properly Documented</H3>
  Must use "javadoc" style comments.  Must include a proper
  <CODE>@author</CODE> tag for each java source file.  Each class and
  method must begin with a comment block that includes a divider line
  that crosses the page.  No line of code or comments may be wider than
  72 columns.  <I>Exceptions:</I> Small methods, such as "getters" and
  "setters" may be grouped together under one comment block.  Anonymous
  classes need not be commented at all.
  
  <H3><LI>Must Run as an Application</H3>
  
  The user interface must be in a "GUI Window" that appears on the
  user's desktop, and which may be closed by clicking on the "close"
  button with an X in it in the upper right corner.<p>
  
  <B>Optional:</B>  The application may also run as an applet, which
  creates the window on the desktop containing the same user interface
  as the stand-alone application.  <I>Note:</I>  Applets may not call
  <I>System.exit()</I>, so if you implement this option, you must
  disable the File/Exit menu item (see below) for GUI Windows created
  by an applet, and the close button must be handled appropriately as
  well.

  <H3><LI>Must Display a Checkerboard</H3>

  The checkerboard must be properly colored, must always be square, and
  must adjust its size to fit the size and shape of the window (Frame)
  containing it.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  The checkerboard may be positioned on the user's
  desktop independently of the rest of the GUI.  (Put it in a Window
  instead of in a Panel.)

  <H3><LI>Must Include a MenuBar</H3>
  
  The menu bar must include File and a Help menus.  The File menu must
  contain a menu item that exits the program when selected.  The Help
  menu must include an "About" menu item that displays the name of the
  program and your name when selected.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  Provide keyboard shortcuts for the menu items.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  Provide menu items for saving a game to a file, for
  loading a saved game from a file, and/or for printing the board.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  Provide a menu item that creates a new Checkerboard
  GUI when selected.  Your program should impose no limit on how many
  GUI windows the user may have open at a time.  There should be a menu
  item for closing a GUI window in addition to one for exiting the
  entire application.<p>
  
  <B>Optional:</B> If your program runs as an applet, it should provide
  a button on the applet itself that creates a new GUI window.

  <H3><LI>Provide <I>Init</I>, <I>Clear</I>, and <I>Exit</I>
  Buttons.</H3>

  Clicking a button performs the indicated action.  In the case of
  <I>init</I> and <I>clear</I> the program must invoke the appropriate
  method in class Checkerboard, and then use Checkerboard's
  <I>listBoard()</I> method to find out what pieces to draw on the
  board.

  <H3><LI>The User Can Move Pieces</H3>

  The user must be able to move pieces using the mouse.  The program
  must not allow moves that are invalid.  Kings must be displayed
  differently from pawns.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  Show the piece being dragged as it moves from the
  starting square to the ending square.  The alternative is to have the
  use click on the starting square, then the ending square, and then to
  make the move.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  Provide a way for the user to enter moves from the
  keyboard.  Use a TextField.  You might want to implement this option
  before implementing the mouse version because it gives you a
  relatively easy way to deal with the user's input.  You can get
  partial credit for this requirement by implementing this option.<p>

  <H3><LI>Optional: Indicate Possible Moves</H3>

  When the user selects a square, indicate all possible moves from that
  square graphically.  You could have the user select a square either
  by clicking on it or by having the mouse hover over it.  You could
  indicate possible moves by highlighting the destination squares or by
  drawing arrows showing the moves.  You could use curved arrows to show
  jumps.  You could have a button that shows all possible moves when
  clicked.  You must use Checkerboard's <I>getMoves()</I> methods to
  determine what moves are possible if you do this part of the project.

  <H3><LI>Optional: Manage Games</LI></H3>
  
  Show the number of pieces remaining for each side.  Make "forced"
  moves automatically.  (In checkers, a piece must jump if it is
  possible, and there may be more than one jump per turn.)  Force the
  two sides to alternate turns.  Show whose turn it is.  Keep track of
  how many games each side has won.
  
  <H3><LI>Optional: Have Your Program Play Checkers</LI></H3>

  Instead of having the user enter all the moves for both sides, have
  the computer play one side of the game, making the best of all
  possible moves each time it is its turn.  It's pretty obvious how to
  do this, so I won't bother explaining it here.
