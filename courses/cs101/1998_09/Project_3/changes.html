<H1>Project 3 Changes</H1>
</center>

This page chronicles the changes to [&nbsp;<a href="index.html">the web
page for Project&nbsp;3</a>&nbsp;].  The idea is to put new material
here so you don't have to deal with the entire assignment page just to
see what is different.  Significant change listed here will also be
emailed to everyone in the class.<p>

<H2>December 16</H2>
My program is perfect now.  See links for December 14 if you want to
prove me wrong.

<H2>December 14</H2>

I replaced Vickery_CB_3.jar with one containing a Move class that
includes methods named <I>getPiece()</I> and <I>equals()</I>.  The
former is for getting the piece involved in the move, and the latter is
for comparing if two moves are equal. (<I>duh!</I>)<p>

You can run my version of the project if you like.  If you want to run
it as an applet, [&nbsp;<a href="Play.html">click here</a>&nbsp;].  If
you want to download it and run it as an application, [&nbsp;<a
href="Vickery_Program.zip">right-click here</a>&nbsp;], then unzip
the jar file, and set your CLASSPATH to Vickery_Program.jar.<p>

<H2>December 10</H2>

The Square class that I included in <CODE>Vickery_CB.jar</CODE> for
Project&nbsp;2 did not include the <I>getRow()</I>, <I>getCol()</I>,
and <I>getPiece()</I> methods for retrieving the values of those
private data members.  This was not a problem for Project&nbsp;2
because the user interface for that project did not use them.<p>

However, you do need these methods for Project&nbsp;3, so I have put up
a new version of <CODE>Vickery_CB.jar</CODE> with the full version of
Square.class in it.  I have named this jar file
<CODE>Vickery_CB_3</CODE>.jar so you won't be so likely to confuse it
with the one from Project&nbsp;2.<p>

You can download it by clicking on the following link:<p>

<blockquote>[&nbsp;<a href="Vickery.zip">Zip file containing
<CODE>Vickery_CB_3.jar</CODE>, the jar file for Project
3</a>&nbsp;]</blockquote>

Remember, to download the zip file, <I>right-click</I> on the link and
select "Save Link As..." or "Save Target As..." depending on which
brand of browser you are using. If you have the WinZip Internet add-on,
you can just left-click on the above link and extract the jar file to
your project directory.
