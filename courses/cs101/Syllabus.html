<H1>CS-101 Syllabus<BR>Evening Section</H1>
</center>

<H2>Prerequisites</H2>

The prerequisites for the course are Math 10 and CS-95, both of which
must be completed with grades of C- or better.

<H2>Textbook</H2>

The textbook for the course is <I>Java How to Program, Second
Edition</I> by H. M. Deitel and P. J. Deitel.  Prentice Hall, 1998. 
ISBN 0-13-899394-7.<p>

You should have covered at least chapters 1-4 in CS-95.  We will cover
material from chapters 5-12 and 17-18 in this course.

<H3>Fall 1999</H3>

We have adopted the <I>third</I> edition of the Deitel and Deitel text for
CS-95 this semester, and I will be incorporating parts of the new book
in CS-101 this term.  But as of right now (August) I haven't seen a
copy of the new edition and am not certain exactly how this will work
out, and the new book is <I>not</I> required for the evening section of
CS-101 -- for now, anyway.<p>

One thing I know about the new edition is that it will come with a CD
that has a copy of the current Java Development Kit on it, as well as
the Inprise JBuilder 3 Integrated Development Environment.  That alone
may make buying the new book worth your while.<p>

You will be required to work with version 1.2 of the Java Development
Kit (JDK 1.2), also known as Java 2, this term.  You can download a free
copy from Sun's website if you need it for off-campus work.

<H3>Lecture Notes</H3>

Dr. Lord's CS-101 Lecture Notes are <I>not</I> required for this course.
I will make material for my lectures available on the Web instead.

<H2>Course Topics</H2>
<UL>
    <LI>Review of classes, methods, and variables
    <LI>Java Virtual Machine (JVM) concepts
    <LI>Arrays
    <LI>Inheritance and Interfaces
    <LI>Class Libraries
    <UL>
        <LI>java.lang
        <LI>java.io
        <LI>java.util (data structures)
        <LI>java.awt (graphics)
    </UL>
    <LI>Exception Management
</UL>

<H2>Course Requirements</H2>

There will be four quizzes and three exams.  Your course average will be
computed as follows:<p>

<center><table cellpad=10 border=0>
<TR><TH align=left>Item<TH align=right>Weight
<TR><TD>Quizzes<TD align=right>25%
<TR><TD>Exams<TD align=right>75%
</table></center>

In addition, there will be three programming projects assigned during
the course.  These projects will be designed to give you practice
writing Java programs, but they will not count towards your course
grade.  Rather, the exams will include both short-answer questions
testing material from the textbook and lectures as well as questions
requiring you to write actual Java code.  If you do the projects you
should be able to write the answers to the coding questions without any
problem.  If you don't do the projects, you most likely will not be
able to pass the exams.<p>

Here is how this works:  Each assignment has a "due date" (a week
before each exam) and a "cutoff date" (the day of the exam).  If you
submit a copy of the assignment by midnight of the due date, I will
provide you with feedback on your code before the exam. The feedback
will include comments on your coding and documentation style as well as
help with finding any bugs you were unable to resolve.  If you submit
the project between the due date and the cutoff date, I will provide
you with whatever (limited) feedback I have time for.<p>

<B>Whether you hand assignments in or not will not affect your grade in
the course, so there is no purpose served by submitting any code that
you did not actually write yoursef.</B><p>

<p STYLE="margin-left:5%; margin-right:5%">This is a new grading policy
for the course, starting with the Fall, 1999 semester.  The idea is to
eliminate the problem of cheating on projects that has existed in the
past, while providing you with the code-writing practice and feedback
that are critical for mastering the material in the course.  Because it
is a new policy, I reserve the right to modify it during the term if
necessary.</P>

<H2>Recommended Books</H2>
There are lots of Java books out there.  Here are some that I recommend.
<UL>
    <LI><I>The Java Class Libraries, Second Edition, Volume 1</I> by P.
    Chan, R. Lee, and D. Kramer.  Addison-Wesley, 1998.  ISBN
    0-201-31002-3.<p>
    
    Expensive, ($56) but supplies complete reference material for the
    classes in the java.io, java.lang, java.lang.reflect, java.math,
    java.net, java.text, java.util, and java.util.zip packages. 
    Includes good explanations and instructive sample code.<p>

    <LI><I>The Java Class Libraries, Second Edition, Volume 2</I> by P.
    Chan and R. Lee.  Addison-Wesley, 1998.  ISBN 0-201-31003-1.<p>
    
    As above for the classes in the java.applet, java.awt, java.beans,
    java.awt.event, java.awt.image, java.awt.peer, and
    java.awt.datatransfer packages.<p>
    
    <LI><I>The Java Developers Almanac</I> by P. Chan.  Addison-Wesley,
    1999.  ISBN 0-201-43298-6.<p>
    
    This is a gem of a book, and at $20 for 860 pages, it's a great
    deal.  It gives you the signature of every member of every class,
    for every version of the JDK.  Unfortunately, except for a lot of
    nifty "examplets" (snippets of code that show you how to do
    standard things, like process command line arguments, or open a web
    page from within a program), there are no explantations.  This book
    is designed for people who already know what they are doing and need
    a convenient place to look things up quickly.  There should be an
    apostrophe in the title, either "Developer's" or "Developers'".<p>

<blockquote>
    <I>Note:</I> The JDK comes with complete documentation for all
    classes in all packages, but does not include good explanations or
    instructive sample code the way the first two books do, and it
    isn't as easy to carry around as the <I>Almanac</I>.  But it's
    free.  Use the file/open menus in your web browser to open the file
    <CODE>index.html</CODE> in <CODE>...\jdk1.1.7\docs</CODE> to get
    started.  (Look for "Core API.")<p>

The following books were written for people interested in learning the
Java language.  They tend to deal more with practical matters than an
academic textbook.<p>

    <LI><I>Just Java 1.2</I> by Peter van der Linden.  Prentice-Hall,
    1999.  ISBN 0-13-010534-1.<p>
    A very well-done tutorial book on how to program using Java. 
    Concentrates on the important parts of the language, and has good
    jokes.<p>
    
    <LI><I>Core Java</I> by C. S. Horstmann and G. Cornell.  Right now
    there are three books with this name.  Volume 1 for JDK 1.1 (ISBN
    0-13-766957-7), Volume 2 for JDK 1.1 (ISBN 0-13-766965-8), and
    Volume 1 for JDK 1.2 (ISBN 0-13-081933-6), with Volume 2 for JDK 1.2
    expected "shortly."  All published by Prentice Hall in 1997, 1998,
    and 1999 respectively.<p>
    
    I haven't looked at these as much as the van der Linden book, but
    the folks at Prentice Hall tell me that the <I>Core Java</I> books
    sell much better than the <I>Just Java</I> book.  So a lot of other
    people must think they are good, which is good enough reason to
    give them serious consideration.

<HR>

    <LI><I>The Java Language Specification</I> by J. Gosling, B. Joy,
    and G. Steele.  Addison-Wesley, 1996.  ISBN 0-201-64451-1.<p> This
    is the definitive source for the Java language.  It's very
    well-written, very clear, and has a great index (try looking up
    "self-reference").  But it is designed for understanding the design
    of the language, not for learning how to program.<p>
