<H2>Introduction</H2>

This web page deals with the important issue of what your code looks
like when viewed in a window or when printed on a piece of paper.  It's
easy to focus on getting the code to compile into a working program and
to lose track of the fact that programs normally have long lives after
they start working.  Of course, the programs you write for college
courses are not typical in this way, but in the "real world" most of the
work on a program comes as bugs are fixed and features are added after
the original version of the code starts working.  It's critical to write
your code so that programmers who come after you will be able to
navigate through your code efficiently and to understand its design
quicky.<p>

To this end, companies that employ programmers normally have a set of
"Programming Standards" that all programmers must adhere to when they
write code. There are similar standards for how you write code for
CS-101, but instead of calling them "standards," I prefer to call them
"guidelines" because I am willing to let you modify them in case you
have another style that accomplishes the same goals as the rules given
here.<p>

I have an ulterior motive here, by the way.  If you write your code
following these guidelines, I will have a lot easier time grading your
programs!  I will be able to locate the code for your classes and
methods quickly, I'll be able to understand the design of your methods
easily, and I'll be able to locate and evaluate errors most readily. 
So, although we are working in an academic environment, there is a good
parallel between your writing clear code for me to grade and your
writing clear code for other programmers to maintain in the real world.

<H2>Tabs and Indentation</H2>

The following are rules that you must follow when you write your code:

<UL>
    <LI>  All code and comments must be indented to show the lexical
    structure of the program.  Basically, this means that each opening
    brace must cause subsequent lines to be indented by a fixed number
    of columns, and that each closing brace must cause subsequent lines
    to be un-indented by the same amount.<P>

    The number of spaces you indent for each lexical level is your
    choice, but I strongly recommend that you use a value of either two
    or four spaces.  (I use two).  The reason is that a larger number of
    spaces leads to very wide lines of code, which often end up wrapping
    around either as you enter them or when they are viewed later (by
    me).  An indent of just one space is hard to read.<P>
    
    <B>Exception:</B>  If there are no statements, or just one
    statement between a pair of braces, you may put the opening and
    closing brace on the same line.<p>

    <B>It is a firm rule for this course that no lines in your
    code, whether Java statements or comments, are to extend beyond
    column 72.</B><p>

    <LI>There must be no <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> characters in your
    code.<p>
    
    The advantage of <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> characters is that a
    single character code in your program will automatically line
    things up.  The problem is that the "automatic" lining up has to be
    done by software, either by your editor, by the software that
    prints your code, or perhaps by a different editor that someone
    else uses to view your code later on.  But there is no universal
    interpretation for these <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> codes, so your
    editor might have tab stops set at every eight columns, the printer
    might have them set at every five columns, and my editor might have
    them set at every two columns.  What a mess.  Fortunately all
    program editors provide an option to substitute the correct number
    of spaces to give the effect as a <CODE>&lt;tab&gt;</CODE> code
    when you press the <CODE>Tab</CODE> key on the keyboard, but by
    putting in the correct number of space characters, the code always
    looks the same whether it's in your editor, going to a printer, or
    in my editor.<p>

    You must not press the <CODE>Tab</CODE> key when editing a program
    file using Notepad (Windows) or Pico (UNIX).  These are primitive
    text editors that cannot be set to substitute spaces for tabs; you
    can't even set the tab spacing using these editors.  Either type
    the spaces to indent your code manually, or get a good programmer's
    editor, such as the free Programmer's File Editor (PFE) described
    on the [&nbsp;<a HREF="Development_Tools.html">Development
    Tools</A>&nbsp;] web page.<p>

    A useful feature of PFE (and similar editors) is that you can
    indent or unindent a block of statements by selecting them and
    pressing <CODE>Tab</CODE> or <CODE>Shift-Tab</CODE>, respectively. 
    This feature is very useful when you change the lexical structure
    of your code, such as by removing an <CODE>if</CODE> statement, and
    need to fix up the indentation.<p>

    <LI>Always leave space between "comment leaders" and comment text. 
    The margin makes it much easier to read the comments.<p>
<PRE>
    //These comments have no
    //margin and are very
    //difficult to read.
    
    //  These comments have two
    //  spaces after the comment
    //  leader (the //) and are
    //  easier to read.
</PRE>
</UL>

<H2>Files and Classes</H2>

Put each class or interface that you write into a separate
<CODE>.java</CODE> file, even if the class is not public.  This modular
design will make it easier to maintain your code, because there is less
code to deal with at a time.<p>

The exceptions to this rule are anonymous and other inner classes. 
Since they are defined inside another class, they pretty obviously
can't be defined in separate files.<p>

<H2>Commenting Your Code</H2>

It's a good idea to put the name of each source file in a comment at the
very beginning of the file.  That way, you can easily tell what file
you are editing as soon as it appears on the screen of your text
editor.<p>

Put a block of comments just before each class, interface, or method in
each source file.  These comments should start with a line that tells
what is being defined, such as:

<pre>
    //  Class Xyx
or    
    //  Interface Abc
or
    //  Method abc()

</pre>

Then put a comment line with a row of dashes, or equal signs, or
asterisks, or whatever you like to make the comment block easy to find
when scrolling through the file.  Don't use this type of comment line
elsewhere; the idea is to show where a class, interface, or method
begins, and nothing else.<p>

Next put a "javadoc" comment block.  (see [&nbsp;<a
HREF="#javadoc">below</A>&nbsp;] for information on running
<I>javadoc</I>.)  A javadoc comment block starts with <CODE>/**</CODE>
(note there must be at least two asterisks) and ends with
<CODE>*/</CODE>.  Asterisks at the beginning of lines inside a javadoc
comment block are ignored, but everything else will be used by javadoc
to generate HTML documentation for your code.<p>

The first thing inside a javadoc block has to be a sentence (capitalize
the first word and end with a period) that tells what the class,
interface, or method does. The style for this sentence is to start with
a present-tense verb with the name of the class, interface, or method
as the implicit subject.  For example, instead of saying "Interface Abc
defines the methods that must ...", say "Defines the methods that must
...".  There can be more than one sentence in the description, but
early versions of javadoc limited the description to just one, and it's
better to make your description brief rather than wordy.<p>

After the description, use javadoc "tags" to tell about specific
features of the class, interface, or method.  A javadoc tag starts with
an <CODE>@</CODE> character followed immediately by the name of the
tag.  We will use just three of these javadoc tags for this course:

<UL> <LI><CODE>@author</CODE>  This tag goes in the javadoc comment
    block that goes before a class or interface.  You may have more
    than one <CODE>@author</CODE> tag in a file (for example when you
    use some code that I provided and added your own code to it), but
    the first <CODE>@author</CODE> tag in every source file you submit
    must have your name <I>and nothing else</I> after your name on the
    line with the <CODE>@author</CODE> tag.  For example,<p>

<pre>
    // @author J. Jones
    // @author C. Vickery
</pre>

    would be okay.  But, 

<pre>
    //  @author J. Jones ID 123-45-6789
</pre>

    would not be okay.  The reason for this is not due to anything about
    javadoc.  Rather, it's because I use programs to help me grade your
    programs, and my grading programs impose this requirement.<p>

    Note that "author" must be lower case and spelled correctly, and
    that there must be no spaces between the <CODE>@</CODE> and the word
    "author."<p>
    
    <LI><CODE>@param</CODE>  This tag goes in the comment block that
    goes at the beginning of a method.  Use one
    <CODE>@param</CODE> tag for each parameter passed to the method,
    even if the method does not actually use the parameter (such as the
    command line arguments passed to <I>main()</I>). 
    After the tag, put one or more spaces, the name of the parameter,
    one or more additional spaces, and a sentence describing the
    purpose of the parameter. The sentence may be continued onto the
    following line if necessary, but should be kept brief.

    <LI><CODE>@return</CODE>.  This tag also goes in the comment block
    that goes at the beginning of a method.  There should be just one
    <CODE>@return</CODE> tag for each method.  After the tag, put a
    sentence that describes the value returned by the method.

    <LI><CODE>@throws</CODE>.  Use one of these tags for each exception
    type listed in the <I>throws</I> clause of a method, if there is
    one.  After the tag, put the name of the type of exception that
    might be thrown, followed by a sentence that tells what situation
    would cause the method to throw the exception.

</UL>

You can see a file that is documented according to these guidelines
[&nbsp;<a HREF="PrintArgs/PrintArgs.html">here</A>&nbsp;]

<a name="javadoc"><H2>Running <I>javadoc</I></H2></a>

The <I>javadoc</I> command generates HTML documentation pages for your
programs by extracting information from the comments in your code.  The
output of the javadoc command changed somewhat between JDK versions
1.1.x and 1.2.  Most notably, the earlier version used graphical images
(GIFs) as labels for the various parts of the generated pages, making it
necessary to copy those images along with the web pages in order to view
the documentation properly.  The later version produces a self-contained
set of pages.<p>

To run <I>javadoc</I>, first create a directory under your project
directory to hold the HTML files produced by <I>javadoc</I>.  If you
named this directory <CODE>docs</CODE>, the command to generate the
documentation for all the .java files in your project directory would be

<pre>
    javadoc -author -d docs *.java
</pre>

You need the <CODE>-author</CODE> switch to get javadoc to process your
<CODE>@author</CODE> tags.  They are ignored by default.  The
<CODE>-d</CODE> switch is immediately followed by the name of the
directory where you want to save the HTML (and other) files generated by
running the <I>javadoc</I> command.  Finally, <CODE>*.java</CODE> uses
the asterisk wildcard to generate a list of all files that have names
ending with .java.<p>

You can view the files generated by javadoc by using a web browser,
even though you are not connected to the Internet.  Use the browser's
File menu, select open, select the directory where you saved the HTML
output, and select the file named <CODE>index.html</CODE> to start
browsing your documentation!<p>

You can click on the following link now to look at the web pages
generated by the Java 2 version of <I>javadoc</I> for the sample code
given above:

<UL>

    <LI>[&nbsp;<a
    HREF="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/PrintArgs/HTML_20/PrintArgs.html">PrintArgs.html
    generated by javadoc version 1.2</A>&nbsp;]

</UL>

Note that you are not to submit javadoc output to me.  I will generate
it myself when I grade your project.
