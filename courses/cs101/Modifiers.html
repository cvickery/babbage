<H2>What is this?</H2>

The following table shows which of the ten modifiers listed in the left
column can be applied to each of the items in the other columns.  For
example, it shows that you cannot have private classes or static local
variables.  What it does not show is that public, private, and
protected are mutually exclusive, and that final and volatile are also
mutually exclusive.<p>

The modifiers are keywords in the language that appear in the
declaration of a class, method, or field:

<UL>

  <LI>Public items can be referenced by code in any class, private
  items can be referenced only from with in the class in which they are
  defined, and protected items can be referenced from only from within
  the class or one of its subclasses.  If none of these three modifiers
  is used where one is allowed, the item has <I>package</I> access,
  which means that it can be referenced from any class in the same
  package as the one in which it is defined.  (If no package is
  declared, all the code in the same disk directory is part of the
  "unnamed" package.)

  <LI>Static items can be referenced using the name of the class in
  which they are defined to access them.  They are not associated with
  class instances, although they can be referenced using instance
  variables.

  <LI>Final items cannot be modified.  In the case of classes and
  methods, it means they cannot be extended or overridden,
  respectively.

  <LI>Abstract classes cannot be instantiated; abstract methods are
  declared but not defined, so they cannot be called.

  <LI>Synchronized methods can be executed by only one thread at a
  time.

  <LI>Transient fields are ones that will not be saved when an object
  is serialized.

  <LI>Volatile fields are eliminated from certain compiler
  optimizations regarding references to them.

  <LI>Native methods are implemented using a language other than Java,
  usually C or C++.<p>

</UL>

An instance field is a variable that is declared outside of any method.
A local field is a variable that is declared inside a method, possibly
inside a local block inside a method.<p>
