<H1>Quiz 4 Study Guide</H1>

The quiz will <I>probably</I> be all short-answer questions.  Here are
some topics that I plan to test you on.  There won't be enough time to
cover everything on the quiz, but anything listed here is fair game!

<UL>

  <LI>Write an event handler that will exit an application if the user closes
a JFrame.

  <LI>Add a menu bar, menus, and menu items to a JFrame.

  <LI>Add action listeners to menu items using anonymous classes.

  <LI>Add a JButton to a JFrame.

  <LI>Define event handler, anonymous class, callback method ….

  <LI>Explain how event handlers and interfaces are related. (Answer:
  an event handler method is always defined inside a class that
  implements the interface for a particular type of event. For example,
  the windowClosing() event handler is defined inside a class that
  implements the WindowListener interface. This way, when an object is
  passed to a JFrame's addWindowListener() method there is a guarantee
  that that object can be used to call windowClosing() because the
  compiler has checked that the object meets the contract set by the
  WindowListener interface.)

  <LI>What are environment variables? How are they set? What are the
  CLASSPATH and JAVA_COMPILER environment variables used for?

  <LI>What is the syntax for the three forms of the jar command? What
  does each one do? What is the relationship between a jar file and a
  zip file?

  <LI>How can you center a JFrame on the screen? How can you center a
  message dialog or file chooser dialog on a JFrame?

  <LI>Write an event handler that will create a new library file when a
  menu item is selected.

  <LI>Explain the relationship between a library file on disk and a
  MP3_Library object in memory.  Know what the various
  methods in class MP3_Libary are used for.  Know how to
  call the static methods; know how to call the instance
  methods.
