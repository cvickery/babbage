<H2>Introduction</H2>
This is a guide to writing the code for Project 2.  You can also use it
as a study guide to prepare for part of the second Exam.<p>

The assignment is to write the LibraryManager class, which does the
following:

<OL>
  <LI>Get the name of a library file from the user; create a File object
  to represent the file in the program.
  <LI>Create a MP3_Library object.
  <LI>Add MP3 files to the MP3_Library.
  <LI>Write the MP3_Library to disk.
</OL>

<H2>Start the Class Definition</H2>

Import all necessary packages, start the class definition, and declare
a variable named libraryFile that will hold a reference to an
MP3_Library object representing a QC MP3 Library File on disk. <p>

Initially, this variable is null because we don't know what disk file
to use yet.  By the way, this variable could have been declared inside
<I>main()</I> instead of outside any method because that is only method
in the whole class so there is no need to share it between methods.  And
it has to be static because it is accessed from inside <I>main()</I>,
which is a static method.

<pre>
import java.awt.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import javax.swing.*;

  public class LibraryManager
  {
  private static MP3_Library  library = null;
</pre>

<H2>Get the Name of a Library File</H2>

First check whether the user supplied a string as a command line
argument.  If yes, create a File object using that string in the
constructor.  Be sure the file name is in proper form by creating
another File object based on the canonical path of the file name
entered by the user.<p>

If the user named a file that does not exist, create it and initialize
it as a QC MP3 Library using one of the static methods in class
MP3_Library.

<pre>
      public static void main( String[] argv ) throws IOException
      {
      String        startDir    = ".";
      File          libraryFile = null;
      JFileChooser  jfc         = null;
        if ( argv.length > 1 )
        {
          System.err.println(
            "Usage: java LibraryManager <music library>" );
            System.exit( 1 );
        }

        if ( argv.length == 1 )
        {
          libraryFile = new File( argv[0] );
          libraryFile = new File( libraryFile.getCanonicalPath() );
          if ( !libraryFile.exists() )
          {
            MP3_Library.initializeLibraryFile( libraryFile );
          }
        }
</pre>

At this point you might have a library file, or you might not.  Set up a
while loop that will not stop until you have one, and it's valid.  If
you already have one, the loop will execute zero times.  The only way to
get out of the loop is if the user selects a legitimate library file, or
exits the program.

<pre>
        while ( libraryFile == null ||
                           !MP3_Library.isLibraryFile( libraryFile ) )
        {
</pre>

If libraryFile is not a null reference, check if the file exists. 
Create it if necessary.  Whether you just created it or not, make sure
it is a valid QC MP3 Library.  Later on we will write new information to
the file, and we don't want to destroy some other kind of file on the
user's disk.<p>

The reason for testing the file even if we just created it is that it
makes the logic of the program simpler (less testing) and it takes very
little time to possibly make one extra validitiy check on the contents
of the file.

<pre>
          if ( libraryFile != null )
          {
            //  Create the file if necessary
            if ( !libraryFile.exists() )
            {
              MP3_Library.initializeLibraryFile( libraryFile );
            }
            if ( !MP3_Library.isLibraryFile( libraryFile ) )
            {
              JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( null,
                  libraryFile.getName() + " is not a library file",
                   "Bad Selection",
                   JOptionPane.WARNING_MESSAGE );
              libraryFile = null;
            }
          }
</pre>

At this point libraryFile will be a null reference if we don't have a
valid library file yet, or it will be a non-null reference if we do have
a valid file.  If it's null, put up a JFileChooser, get the user's
choice, and go back to the top of the while loop to check if this file
is valid or not.

<pre>
          if (libraryFile == null )
          {
            //  Give instructions and chance to exit if no file has
            //  been selected
            if ( JOptionPane.CANCEL_OPTION ==
                   JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(
                     null,
                     "Select a Music Library, or choose Cancel to exit",
                     "Need a Library",
                     JOptionPane.OK_CANCEL_OPTION ) )
            {
              System.exit( 0 );
            }

            jfc = new JFileChooser( startDir );
            jfc.showOpenDialog( null );
            libraryFile = jfc.getSelectedFile();
            if ( libraryFile == null )
              System.exit( 0 );
            startDir = libraryFile.getParent();
          }
        }
</pre>

Now we are out of the while loop, so libraryFile is a legitimate library
file.  It might be newly-created, or it might be one that existed before
and already has some mp3 file names in it.  But in either case, the
first line of the file is the magic string, "#QCMP3LIB".<p>

<H2>Create a MP3_Library Object</H2>

First, print the name of the library file.  Doing so is part of the
assignment.<p>

<pre>
        //  Valid Library file has been created or located
        System.out.println( "The library file is " +
                                      libraryFile.getAbsolutePath() );
</pre>

At this point, we know that libraryFile is a reference to a File object
that represents a valid library file, but the MP3_Library constructor
doesn't know that, and it will check that what we pass to it is
legitimate.  If not, it will throw an exception, so we have to wrap the
new operation in a try block.  If an exception really is thrown,
something is radically wrong, and we print an error message, and
exit.<p>

Note that you would consult the documentation for the MP3_Library
constructor to find out that it might throw an
InvalidMP3LibraryFile, and under what circumstances it might do this.

<pre>
        try
        {
          library = new MP3_Library( libraryFile );
        }
        catch ( InvalidLibraryFile ilf )
        {
          System.err.println( "Unable to create MP3_Library: " +
                                                   ilf.getMessage() );
          System.exit( 1 );
        }
</pre>

<H2>Add .mp3 Files to the Library</H2>

Now the program searches the disk for valid .mp3 files.  The task is
made easier than it sounds because (1) class FileIterator will let you
use the methods in the Iterator interface to get a File object for every
regular file on the disk starting in the directory you specify. (2)
Class MP3_Library's <I>add()</I> method tests the File object you give
it to see if it represents a real MP3 file or not, and only adds the
files that pass the test to its Vector of MP3_File objects.  If you
wanted to, you could test the boolean value returned by <I>add()</I> to
see whether a particular file was added to the library or not, but it's
not necessary in this program.<p>

Note that we have to create a File object representing the directory we
want to start the search in so we can pass it to the FileIterator's
constructor.  It's the need to be able to get the proper pathname of
this directory from the library file's pathname that made us be careful
to create the File object for the library file so carefully earlier.<p>

Note also that you have to cast the reference returned by <I>next()</I>
into a File object because the signature for <I>next()</I> just says it
returns an Object.  But FileIterator always returns references to
Files, so this cast is safe to do.

<pre>
        //  Add all MP3s in this directory or below to the library
        File dir = new File( libraryFile.getParent() );
        System.out.println( "Adding MP3 files in directory " +
                                              dir.getAbsolutePath() +
                                              " to " +
                                              libraryFile );
        FileIterator fi = new FileIterator( dir );
        while ( fi.hasNext() )
        {
          library.add( (File) fi.next() );
        }
</pre>

<H2>Write the Library File to Disk</H2>

Once again, this may sound complicated, but it's actually simple,
because there is a <I>write()</I> method in class MP3_Library that will
do all the work for us.

<pre>
        System.out.println( "Saving " + libraryFile.getName() );
        library.write();
        System.exit( 0 );
      }

  } // End of class LibraryManager!

</pre>
