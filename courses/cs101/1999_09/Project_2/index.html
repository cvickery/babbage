<H1>Music Library Project</H1>
</center>

<H2>Overview</H2>
This project will be a library manager for a user's MP3 collection.  It
is patterned on the Music Library feature of the Music Match Jukebox,
but it is much more modest than that because the library is not
integrated with any sort of MP3 player or recorder.  Rather, it will
provide just a list of MP3 files along with information about the music
in each file.  Information about an MP3 file will come from both the
contents of the file and from information supplied by the user
interactively.

<H2>Objects Used in this Project</H2>
The following list summarizes the major classes needed for this
project.  S<p>
<table align=center cellpadding=5 border=0 width=80%>

  <TR>
    <TH align=left valign=bottom>Class Name
    <TH align=left valign=bottom>Number of Instances
    <TH align=left valign=bottom>Description

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>LibraryManager
    <TD valign=top>One
    <TD valign=top>The user interface for the application -- the class
    you are to write for this project.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>MP3_Library
    <TD valign=top>One
    <TD valign=top>Container for information about all the MP3 files in
    the user's library.  Used by class LibraryManager.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>MP3_File
    <TD valign=top>One for each MP3 file in the library
    <TD valign=top>Holds specific information about one MP3 file.  Used
    by class MP3_Library.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>MP3_Header
    <TD valign=top>One for each MP3File object.
    <TD valign=top>Holds information extracted from the first audio
    frame of an MP3 file.  None of this information can be changed by
    the user.  Used by class MP3_File.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>ID3V1_Info
    <TD valign=top>Zero or one for each MP3File object.
    <TD valign=top>If present, holds ID3V1 tag information for a MP3 file.
    Used by class MP3_File.

  <TR>
    <TD valign=top>ID3V2_Info
    <TD valign=top>Zero or on for each MP3File object.
    <TD valign=top>If present, holds ID3V2 tag information for a MP3 file.
    Used by class MP3_File.

<H2>Project Structure</H2>

The command line to start the program will be "<CODE>java LibraryManager
<I>&lt;library&gt;</I></CODE>".  That is, the initial class to be loaded
will be <CODE>LibraryManager</CODE>, and the user may optionally specify
the name of a library file to start working with.<p>

The user interface will implement the following algorithm:

<PRE>
      If a library file name was specified on the command line, create a
      File object for the file.  Otherwise put up a JFileChooser dialog
      so that the user can select a library file to work with.
      
      If the library file specified by the user does not exist yet,
      create it and initialize it as a "Queens College MP3 Library"
      file.  If the file already exists, verify that it is a valid
      Queens College MP3 Library.

      Create a MP3_Library object using the library file selected by
      the user.
      
      Add all the files located in the same directory as the library
      file as well as all files in directories below that to the
      library.
      
      Write the library file to disk.

<H2>Classes Provided</H2>

  I am providing you with all the classes you need to do the first part
  of the project.  All you need to do is to use them, along with
  JOptionPanel, to interact with the user to get a valid library file
  created.  Right click [&nbsp;<a HREF="vickery.exe">this
  link</A>&nbsp;] to download a self-extracting file with my classes in
  it. (Left click on the link if you prefer to extract the files over
  the web.)<p>

  You can [&nbsp;<a HREF="DOCS">view the documentation for these
  classes from the web</A>&nbsp;] (left-click).  Alternatively, you can
  right-click [&nbsp;<a HREF="vickery_docs.exe">this link</A>&nbsp;] to
  download a self-extracting file so you can view the documentation
  from your computer. (Left click on the link if you prefer to extract
  the files over the web.)<p>

<H2>Sample MP3 Files</H2>

  You can [&nbsp;<a HREF="../Project_1/Sample_MP3_Files">download
  sample MP3 files</A>&nbsp;] to your computer for testing your
  program.<p>

<H2>Additional Work</H2>

  Once you have the basic project working, I suggest you implement
  class FileIterator.  As mentioned in Lecture 18, the "trick" is that
  the constructor and method <I>next()</I> must "look ahead" to see
  what file, if any, will be next.  Method <I>hasNext()</I> needs to
  test the result of that lookahead operation.  The other issue is to
  keep track of whether a particular filename returned by
  File.<I>list()</I> is actually a file or a directory.  Note, by the
  way, that there are some things in this list that are neither files
  nor directories, so it's not always true, for example, that
  <I>isDirectory()</I> will always return <I>true</I> for a file name
  for which <I>isFile()</I> returns <I>false</I>, and
  <I>vice-versa</I>.<p>
  
  In a similar vein, you should try writing a recursive method to
  accomplish the same thing as class FileIterator.  It's easier to do,
  so what advantage, if any, is there to writing FileIterator?<p>
