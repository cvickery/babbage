//  Memory.java

//    Instance variables are declared outside of any method and do not
//    have a "static" modifier.  Sometimes called global variables
//    because they can be accessed from any non-static method in the
//    class.  There are as many copies of each instance variable as
//    there are instances of the class.

//    Class variables are also declared outside of any method, but
//    they do have a "static" modifier.  They are also sometimes
//    called global variables because they can be accessed from any
//    method in the class, whether the method is static or not.  There
//    is just one copy of each static variable, no matter how many
//    times the class is instantiated.

//    Parameter variables ("parameters") are values that are passed
//    to a method when it is invoked.  Parameters can be accessed only
//    from inside the method.

//    Local variables are declared inside a method.  There is a new
//    copy of each local variable each time the method is invoked.
//    Locals can be accessed only from inside the method.  They must
//    appear on the left side of an equal sign before they are
//    referenced.
