Your personalized exam will be placed at your assigned seat on the
evening of the exam, so be sure to sit at the proper place.  Your name
and the last four digits of your ID number will be on the exam booklet
and on the answer key.<BR>Be sure you use the correct exam!</table>

There will be two parts to the exam.  The first part will be short
answer questions (true/false and multiple-choice), which you will answer
on a mark-sense form.  <B>Be sure to bring a No. 2 pencil for this part
of the exam.</B>  The second part will test your ability to write Java
programs.<p>

What follows is a guide, but it may not be complete.  Be sure to review
all your lecture notes and the assigned readings from the textbook
(Chapters 1-6).

<H2>Study Topics for Short Answer Questions</H2>

<UL>

  <LI>Be able to define the following terms: class, object, method,
  field, instance field, static field.
  
  <LI>Know the differences and similarities between arrays and Vectors.
  
  <LI>Know how to determine the number of elements in an array and/or
  Vector.

  <LI>Know what the Iterator interface is and how to use it.
  
  <LI>Know the difference between primitive types and classes.
  
  <LI>Know the syntax for defining a method.
  
  <LI>Know the syntax for instantiating (calling) a method.
  
  <LI>Know how many times static and instance fields occur in memory. 
  (Answers: "once," and "as many times as the class is instantiated.")
  
  <LI>Know what a constructor is.
  
  <LI>Know what the new operator does. 
  
  <LI>Know what reference fields are.  Know that they are the same
  thing as pointers.
  
  <LI>Know what <I>System.out.println()</I> and <I>System.exit()</I> do.
  
  <LI>Know what a return statement does, how it relates to the method
  signature, and how to use it.

</UL>

<H2>Study Topics for Writing Code</H2>

<UL>

  <LI>The best way to study for this part of the test is to write programs! 

  <LI>You do not need to memorize the argument lists for methods and
  constructors.  You will be provided with reference material like
  the following:
  <pre>
      void showMessageDialog( java.awt.Component parentComponent,
                              Object              message )
  </pre>

  <LI>For this exam, you will not have to write applets or HTML, only
  applications.
  
  <LI>You should be able to process command line arguments, for example
  to print them or to use one as the argument for the JFileChooser
  constructor.

  <LI>You should be able to write classes containing methods that create
  and initialize arrays and Vectors.
  
  <LI>You should be able to write code that iterates over all the
  elements of a singly or doubly subscripted array or all the elements
  of a Vector.
  
  <LI>You should be able to write code that can instantiate objects,
  call instance methods, and/or call static methods.

  <LI> Quizzes 1 and 2 are simpler than some of the code you will have
  to write.
