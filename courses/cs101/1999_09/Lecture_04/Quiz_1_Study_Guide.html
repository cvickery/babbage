<H2>Answers</H2>

<OL>

  <LI><I>Do you have to import anything?</I>  No, you only need import
  statements to tell the compiler what packages contain the classes that
  you are using.  If you only use classes from the
  <CODE>java.lang</CODE> package, you don't need to import anything.

  <LI><I>Does there have to be a class definition?</I>  Yes, every .java
  file must contain at least one class definition.

  <LI><I>Does there have to be a method definition?</I>  Yes, every Java
  appplication has to define a method named <I>main</I>.  <B>But</B>
  you can have classes that don't contain method definitions.  You just
  can't use such classes as applications.

  <HR>

  <LI><I>Does the class have to have a name?</I>  Yes, every class has
  to have a name.

  <LI><I>Does the class have to be public?</I>  No.  But it's all right
  if it is.

  <LI><I>Does the name of the .java file have to match the name of the
  class?</I>  It depends.  If the class is public, the names have to
  match, but if it's not public they don't.

  <LI><I>Can there be more than one class definition in a .java
  file?</I>  Yes, as many as you want.

  <LI><I>Can there be more than one <u>public</u> class definition in a
  .java file?</I>  No, because the file name has to match the name of
  any public class defined in the class.  You can't have more than one
  name for a file, so there can't be more than one public class.

  <HR>
  
  <LI><I>What are the name, number and type(s) of argument(s), and
  return type of the one method that every application must define?</I>
  The name of the method must be <I>main</I>.  It must receive exactly
  one argument, of type <CODE>String[]</CODE>.  The name of the argument
  can be anything, but traditional names are <I>args</I> and <I>argv</I>.
  The return type must be <CODE>void</CODE>, which means the the method
  must contain either no <CODE>return</CODE> statements, or that any
  <CODE>return</CODE> statements must not specify return values.

  <LI><I>What two attributes must this method have?</I>  It must be
  <CODE>public</CODE> and <CODE>static</CODE>.
  
  <LI><I>What do these two attributes mean?</I>  A <I>public</I> method
  is one that can be invoked from other classes, even if those other
  classes are not in the same package as this one.  A <I>static</I>
  method is one that can be invoked without instantiating its class. 
  Method <I>main()</I> has to be static because the the class containing
  it is not automatically instantiated when the application starts
  running.
