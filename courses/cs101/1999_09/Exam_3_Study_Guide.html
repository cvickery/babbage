<H1>Exam 3 Study Guide</H1>
</center>

The study guide is given in [&nbsp;<a HREF="Lecture_28">Lecture
28</A>&nbsp;].  Also, I was asked to make the source code for Project
3d available because Project 3e contains material that you won't be
tested on (how to use JTable).  So I here are the links for 3d:
[&nbsp;<a
HREF="Project_3/LibraryManager_3d.html">LibraryManager.java</A>&nbsp;]
and [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Project_3/MP3_Library_3d.html">MP3_Library.java</A>&nbsp;]. 
However,I would advise you to try studying the code for 3e, and then
fall back to the code for 3d only if 3e is too confusing.
