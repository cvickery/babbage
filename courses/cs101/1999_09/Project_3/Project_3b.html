<H1>Project 3b</H1>
</center>
<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

Send me email with an attached jar file containing LibraryManager.java
by midnight, November 30.

<H2>How to Create the Jar File</H2>

From the directory containing your LibraryManager.java file, give this
command:
<pre>
      jar cvf project3b.jar LibraryManager.java
</pre>

Then, just attach the file named project3b.jar to your email message,
and send it to me.<p>

There are three reasons for using a jar file to submit your project:
<OL>
  <LI>The jar command is free.  It comes with the JDK.  WinZip is
  shareware, which means that you can use it for free for a while, but
  after that you are supposed to pay a fee to use it.
  <LI>By putting your file(s) inside a jar file, the capitalization and
  spelling are preserved so that when I extract your files from the jar
  file they will compile properly because their names are spelled and
  capitalized properly.  Some mail programs "mangle" file names when you
  attach them to your message.  If this happens to a jar file it's not a
  problem because the jar command is indifferent to capitalization or
  even what the name of a file is; it just extracts the contents while
  preserving capitalizion for you.
  <LI>Jar and zip files are compressed, which makes your email message
  smaller.  Also, you can put several files inside a jar or zip file,
  which will be an advantage when the project gets bigger and involves
  multiple .java files.
</OL>

<H2>Working Code</H2>

If you want, you can download a working version of this project so you
can see what the result should look like.  (The working code includes
some optional features that are not required, like centering the window
on the screen.)<p>

To get the working code <B>right</B>-click [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Project_3b.jar">on
this link</A>&nbsp;] and select "Save Target As..." (or "Save Link As...")
from the menu that shows up.  Save the file using the name
<u>Project_3b.jar</u>.<p>

<B>November 30 Update:</B> There is a copy of the jar file with the
name changed to [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Project_3b.zip">Project_3b.zip</A>&nbsp;].  If you have trouble
downloading and using Project_3b.jar, try downloading downloading
Project_3b.zip instead.<p>

To run the program, first give this command at
the DOS prompt:

<pre>
    set CLASSPATH=Project_3b.jar
</pre>

Or, if you downloaded Project_3b.zip instead, use this command:

<pre>
    set CLASSPATH=Project_3b.zip
</pre>


Now, from the directory that has the downloaded jar file in it, give the
command:

<pre>
    java LibraryManager
</pre>

Note that this will load LibraryManager.class from the jar file, but
only if there is not a LibraryManager.class file in the current
directory, so it's a good idea to download the .jar file into an empty
directory.<p>

In addition to giving you a chance to run my "perfect" version of the
project, doing this little exercise will help you to understand jar
files better.  If you want to see what is inside the jar file, you can
use this command:

<pre>
    jar tvf Project_3b.jar
</pre>

Note that there is no need to extract the class files from the jar file
to run the program.  If CLASSPATH is set to the name of a jar file, the
java command will look inside the jar file automatically to find
whatever class files it needs (in addition to finding standard class
files in the usual way).<p>

If you ever do want to get things out of a jar file, however, the
command is "jar xvf &lt;jar file&gt; &lt;file name(s)&gt;".  For example,
you could use this command to extract all the class files from
Project_3b.jar (or Project_3b.zip) and skip the business of setting the
CLASSPATH since the class files would now be in the current
directory.<p>

<B>Summary of Jar command options:</B>

<UL>

    <LI><CODE>jar cvf &lt;file name&gt; file...</CODE><BR>Use this
    command to <u>c</u>reate a jar file.  The v is for "verbose" and
    will cause more messages to print than if you leave it out.  The f
    is for "file" and it means that the next argument is the name of
    the jar file you want to create.  The "file..." part means that you
    can list as many files as you want, and they will all be compressed
    and put inside the jar file.  Wildcards are often convenient for
    the last part of the command.

    <LI><CODE>jar tvf &lt;file name&gt;</CODE><BR>Use this command to
    <u>t</u>est the contents of a jar file.  It will print the names of
    all the files that are inside the jar file.  The v and f are the
    same as for the previous example.

    <LI><CODE>jar xvf &lt;file name&gt; file...</CODE><BR>Use this
    command to e<u>x</u>tract the list of files specified by the
    "file..." part of the command.  If you omit "file...", all the
    files in the jar file will be extracted. </UL>

See the JDK documentation for the jar command for more details.  

<H2>Project Description</H2>

Write an application that has a standard menu bar, a File menu, and a
Help menu.  The File menu should have a New menu, as well as Open and
Exit menu items.  The File->New menu should have Library and Library
Manager menu items. The Help menu should have an About menu item.<p>

First get all the menus and menu items created and added to a JFrame.
Even though none of the menu items does anything, make sure the
application runs and that you can use the mouse to activate all the
menus and click on all of the menu items.<p>

Now add code so that the Close Window button actually exits the
application.  Also, add code so the File->Exit menu item exits the
application too.  Test to make sure they work.<p>

Now add code so that the Help->About menu item activates a message
dialog that tells the name of the program, your name, and the version. 
Test to make sure it works.<p>

Now add code so that the File->New->LibraryManager menu item creates a
new instance of the graphical user interface.  You should be able to
exit the application using any of the instances that the user creates. 
Test to make sure it works.<p>

Optional:  Add code so the File->Exit and Close Window buttons close
only the current instance of the GUI.  Don't actually exit the program
unless the user closes/exits the only remaining instance.  Here's how
to do this:  Create a static int to count how many instances of the
LibraryManager there are.  This counter should start at zero and be
incremented every time the class is instantiated.  The natural place to
increment the counter is in a constructor for the class, so you will
have to add the constructor to the class.  Every time the user clicks
on the close window button or the File->Exit menu item, subtract one
from the instance counter. If the the result is zero, exit the
application.  But if not, call the dispose() method for the JFrame
object.<p>

Remember to document your code using proper javadoc comments and tags.
Also, be sure no lines are longer than 72 characters, and be sure there
are no tab characters in your code.  (Set your editor to expand tabs to
spaces.)<p>
