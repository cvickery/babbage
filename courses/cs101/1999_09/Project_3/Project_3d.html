<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

Send me email with an attached jar or zip file containing LibraryManager.java
by midnight, December 14.

<H2>Working Code</H2>

I am supplying working code for this project in two zip files:
<ul>
    <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="Project_3d.zip">Project_3d.zip</A>&nbsp;]
    <BR>Right-click (or shift-click) on this link to download the file
    into a directory where you can test it.
    <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="LibraryManager_3d.zip">LibraryManager_3d.zip</A>&nbsp;]
    <BR>Right-click (or shift-click) on this link to download the file
    into the same directory you used for Project_3d.zip
</ul>
To run the program, first give this command at the DOS prompt:

<pre>
    set CLASSPATH=Project_3d.zip;LibraryManager_3d.zip
</pre>

Now, from the directory that has the downloaded zip files in it, give the
command:

<pre>
    java LibraryManager
</pre>

Note that this will load LibraryManager.class from the zip file, but
only if there is not a LibraryManager.class file in the current
directory, so it's a good idea to download the .zip file into an empty
directory.<p>

This version of the program should do everything except
display the list of MP3 files in the center of the Library
Manager window.  (Let me know if you have any trouble
running it.)<P>

You can view the current documentation for all my code either [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Docs_3d">online</A>&nbsp;] or by downloading [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Docs_3d.zip">Docs_3d.zip</A>&nbsp;].  If you download the zip
file, you should use Winzip (or the command, <CODE>jar xvf
Docs_3d.zip</CODE>) to unzip the files into their own directory, and
then use your web browser to look at the file <CODE>index.html</CODE> in
that directory.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

This project adds event handlers for all remaining user
interface components, handles multiple LibraryManager
instances correctly, includes an "Exit All" File menu item,
and adds tool tips to all menu items and the "Add File"
button.<P>

Be sure you have Project 3c working before you work on this
one.  You can look at my [&nbsp;<a
href="LibraryManager_3c.html">LibraryManager.java for
Project 3c</a>&nbsp;] if you want help catching up.<P>

This is a "clean things up" step in prepation for the last step of the
project we will get to this semester, [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Project_3e.html">Project 3e</A>&nbsp;].  The idea is now to
implement the things that were optional in previous steps.  Opening a
library should enable the "Add File" button and "Close" menu item;
closing a library should disable them.  In my code I took advantage of
this step to make the labels on the menu items shorter.  This is
justified by adding tool tip text to each one that gives a fuller
explanation of what each one does.<p>

Handling multiple instances of the LibraryManager requires some work to
coordinate the multiple instances.  A LibraryManager shouldn't be able
to open a library file that is already open by another LibraryManager. 
Also, the "Exit All" menu item needs to make sure all currently open
LibraryManagers give the user the opportunity to save changes to their
libraries before exiting.<p>

You can handle multiple instances as follows:

<OL>

  <LI>Create a static Vector to hold references to all LibraryManager
      instance.  If you called this Vector "instances" you could add
      this line to LibraryManager's constructor or <I>init()</I> 
      method: <pre>instances.add( this );</pre>
      
  <LI>Whenever the user closes a window or selects File->Exit, execute
  this line of code before calling <I>dispose()</I>:
  <pre>instances.remove( this );</pre>
  
  <LI>Whenever the user selects File->Close All, iterate over
  <I>instances</I>, and call each instance's <I>doClose()</I> method. 
  That method should check if the MP3_Library has changed and if so, it
  should ask the user whether to save the changes or not, and call
  library.write() if the user says yes.  (See [&nbsp;<a
  HREF="../Lecture_26">Lecture 26</A>&nbsp;] for a fuller description
  of <I>doClose()</I>.)
  
  <LI>Whenever the user selects File->Open, iterate over
  <I>instances</I>, and see if any library manager is working with the
  same file as the user has selected.  For example, here is some code
  from my <I>doOpen()</I> method (the one that is called from the
  File->Open event handler):

<pre>
          file = jfc.getSelectedFile();
          try
          {
            file = new File ( file.getCanonicalPath() );
            if ( ! MP3_Library.isLibraryFile( file ) )
            {
              throw new Exception( "Invalid Library File" );
            }
            if ( isOpen( file ) ) // <B>See Below</B>
            {
              throw new Exception( "Already open." );
            }
            lib = new MP3_Library( file );
            doClose();
            library = lib;
            gui.setTitle( "Library Manager: " + library.getFileName() );
            fileClose.setEnabled( true );
            addFile.setEnabled( true );
          }
          catch ( Exception e )
          {
            JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(
              gui,
              "Error: " + e.getMessage(),
              "Unable to Open Library",
              JOptionPane.ERROR_MESSAGE );
          }

</pre>

  And here is the method <I>isOpen()</I> that does the work we are
  talking about:

<PRE>
    //  Static Method isOpen()
    //  --------------------------------------------------------------
    /**
      *   Tells whether a File is currently open by any LibraryManager
      *   instance.
      *
      *     @param  file The File object to be checked.
      *     @return true if a LibraryManager instance has the file
      *             open.
      */
      public static boolean isOpen( File file )
      {
        Iterator iter = instances.iterator();
        while ( iter.hasNext() )
        {
          LibraryManager lm = (LibraryManager) iter.next();
          if ( lm.library != null )
          {
            File f = lm.library.getFile();
            if ( f.equals( file ) )
            {
              return true;
            }
          }
        }
        return false;
      }
</PRE>

  In my code, <I>library</I> is a reference to the MP3_Library
  currently open by the LibraryManager.  Because <I>doOpen()</I> is a
  static method in the LibraryManager class, it has direct access to
  this field, given a reference to an instance of the class.  To make
  this code work, I had to add method <I>getFile()</I> to class
  MP3_Library.  When you downloaded Project_3d.zip you got the updated
  version of MP3_Library.class that contains this new method.
