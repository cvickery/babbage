<H1>Project 3c</H1>
</center>
<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

Send me email with an attached jar or zip file containing LibraryManager.java
by midnight, December 7.

<H2>How to Create the Jar or Zip File</H2>

From the directory containing your LibraryManager.java file, give this
command:
<pre>
      jar cvf project3c.jar LibraryManager.java
</pre>

Then, just attach the file named project3c.jar to your email message,
and send it to me.<p>

If you wish, you may use WinZip or a similar utility to create the file
you send me.  You can even use the jar command to create a zip file:
<pre>
    jar cvf Project_3c.zip LibraryManager.java
</pre>
<H2>Working Code</H2>

I am supplying working code for this project in two zip files:
<ul>
    <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="Project_3c.zip">Project_3c.zip</A>&nbsp;]
    <BR>Right-click (or shift-click) on this link to download the file
    into a directory where you can test it.
    <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="LibraryManager_3c.zip">LibraryManager_3c.zip</A>&nbsp;]
    <BR>Right-click (or shift-click) on this link to download the file
    into the same directory you used for Project_3c.zip
</ul>
To run the program, first give this command at the DOS prompt:

<pre>
    set CLASSPATH=Project_3c.zip;LibraryManager_3c.zip
</pre>

Now, from the directory that has the downloaded zip files in it, give the
command:

<pre>
    java LibraryManager
</pre>

Note that this will load LibraryManager.class from the zip file, but
only if there is not a LibraryManager.class file in the current
directory, so it's a good idea to download the .jar file into an empty
directory.<p>

You should be able to use this program to create multiple instances of
the LibraryManager's JFrame, and you should be able to create new
library files and to add MP3 files to them.  There is a Close All menu
item that is not implmented yet, so nothing will happen if you click on
it.<p>

You can view the documentation for all my code either [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Docs_3c">online</A>&nbsp;] or by downloading [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Docs_3c.zip">Docs_3c.zip</A>&nbsp;].  If you download the zip
file, you should use Winzip (or the command, <CODE>jar xvf
Docs_3c.zip</CODE>) to unzip the files into their own directory, and
then use your web browser to look at the file <CODE>index.html</CODE> in
that directory.

<H2>Project Description</H2>

This project adds the event handler for File->New->Library File to the
code you should now have working for Project 3b.  (If not, you can see
[&nbsp;<a HREF="LibraryManager_3b.html">my code for Project
3b</A>&nbsp;].)  This project also adds a JButton to the JFrame's
content pane that can be used to add individual MP3 files to a library
file.<p>

There are two ways you could structure this part of the project, but
whichever one you choose, be sure you have Project 3b working before you
work on this one.

<OL>

  <LI>You could structure your code the same way I did in the code given
  in Lecture 25: Have an anonymous class implement the ActionListener
  interface for the "New Library" menu item, but have the
  <I>actionPerformed()</I>
  method do nothing but invoke another method, the one I called
  <I>newLib()</I> in the code I gave.  Then do all the work in
  <I>newLib()</I>, keeping the anonymous class small.
  
  <LI>You could create a separate, named, class to hold the event
  handler for the New Library menu item.  All the logic in my
  <I>newLib()</I> method would go in this class'
  <I>actionPerformed()</I> method.
  
  <LI>You could combine the two previous techniques by using an
  anonymous class implement the ActionListener interface, but put all
  the logic for creating a new library file inside that class'
  <I>actionPerformed()</I> method.  <u><I>This is not a good
  technique</I></u> because it makes the anonymous class too big.  Use
  anonymous classes only for small amounts of code.

  <LI>You could have a separate class with a single
  <I>actionPerformed()</I> method for the action listeners for all menu
  items and buttons.  <u><I>This is not a good technique</I></u>
  because the <I>actionPerformed()</I> method then has to test the
  ActionEvent object passed to it each time to figure out what it is
  supposed to do. Although you will see this kind of code elsewhere,
  don't do it.  It adds extra processing time to the event handler as
  it figures out what it is supposed to do, and more importantly it
  leads to complicated code that is difficult to understand and likely
  to contain bugs.

<H3>Some Notes on the Sample Code</H3>

The sample code in Lecture 25 is lifted directly from my own program,
so you will have to make some changes to get it to work in your own
program.  You should write your own version rather than try to get mine
to work, though.  You will learn more that way.<p>

In my program, I used an instance variable named <CODE>library</CODE>
to hold a reference to the MP3_Library object representing the library
file being managed.  If <CODE>library</CODE> is null it means the user
has not selected a library file to manage yet (and the Add File button
is disabled).  When the user selects a new library file, it is possible
that there is already a library file open.  If there is one open, you
have to check if the MP3_Library object has changed since last being
written to disk and to call <CODE>library</CODE>.<I>write()</I> if it
has changed.  <CODE>library</CODE>.<I>isChanged()</I> will return true
if the file needs to be written and will return false if not.  I put
this logic inside a method called <I>close()</I>, but you could put it
directly inside <I>newLib()</I> (or directly in
<I>actionPerformend()</I>) if you prefer.  My sample code makes sure
the new library file can be initialized and that the new MP3_Library
object for it can be created before closing the currently open library;
the local variable <CODE>lib</CODE> is used to hold the reference to
the new library before using it to replace this library manager's
<CODE>library</CODE> reference.<p>

There are annotations on the sample code (in the lecture notes)
pointing out exceptions that might occur.  My code enclosed all the
statements that might throw any kind of exception (as well as several
more lines of code) inside a big <I>try</I> block, and used a single
<I>catch</I> block on class Exception (the superclass of all exception
classes) to handle any failure.

<H3>Adding an MP3 File to a Library</H3>

Here is the code I used as the Add File button's event handler:
<PRE>
        addFile.addActionListener( new ActionListener() {
          public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent ae ) {
            JFileChooser  jfc   = new JFileChooser( startDir );
            int           reply = jfc.showOpenDialog( gui );
            if ( reply == JFileChooser.APPROVE_OPTION )
            {
              File f = jfc.getSelectedFile();
              try
              {
                if ( library.add( f ) )
                {
                  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( gui,
                    "Added " + f.getName() +
                    " to " + library.getFileName() );
                }
                else
                {
                  JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( gui,
                    "Not Added: Duplicate file." );
                }
              }
              catch ( Invalid_MPEG_FileException imfe )
              {
                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog( gui,
                  "Not Added: " + imfe.getMessage() );
              }
            }
          } } );
</PRE>

The trick here is that MP3_Library.<I>add()</I> returns false if it was
unable to add a valid MP3 file to the library because the file is
already in the library, but it also might throw 
an Invalid_MPEG_FileException if the file you give it is not a valid MP3
file.  So there is an <I>if</I> statement to check for the duplicate
entry problem, and a <I>try/catch</I> pair to handle the invalid MP3
file possibility.<p>

Remember to document your code using proper javadoc comments and tags.
Also, be sure no lines are longer than 72 characters, and be sure there
are no tab characters in your code.  (Set your editor to expand tabs to
spaces.)<p>
