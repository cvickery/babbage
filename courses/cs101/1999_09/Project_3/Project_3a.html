<H1>Project 3a</H1>
</center>
<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

Send me email with an attached jar file containing LibraryManager.java
by midnight, November 23.

<H2>How to Create the Jar File</H2>

From the directory containing your LibraryManager.java file, give this
command:
<pre>
      jar cvf project3a.jar LibraryManager.java
</pre>

Then, just attach the file named project3a.jar to your email message,
and send it to me.

<H2>Description</H2>

All you need to do is to write an <I>application</I> that has a working
exit button and which also exits if the user clicks on the "x" button
in the upper right corner of the Frame.  Use javax.swing classes JFrame,
and JButton, as described in class.<p>

You do <I>not</I> have to make your program run as both an applet and as
an application, but I encourage you to experiment with this feature once
you have the basic application working.<p>

You do <I>not</I> have to make your application's Frame come up centered
in the user's screen, but I encourage you to experiment with this
feature once you have the basic application working.<p>

You do <I>not</I> have to make your Exit button have a tool tip, but I
encourage you to experiment with this feature once you have the basic
application working.
