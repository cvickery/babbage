</center>

<H2>Submission and Grading</H2>

This project is due by midnight September 30.<p>

Remember, projects for this course are not graded; they are designed to
help you master programming concepts that you will be tested on in the
next exam (October 7).  If you submit the project on time, I will
provide you with feedback on your programming style or, if there is a
bug, with a suggested fix before the exam.  I encourage you to work on
the project alone because that is the best way to learn the concepts
involved.  But if you get stuck, feel free to get help any way you wish
in order to move forward on the program.  If you don't understand how
do the project on your own you probably won't be able to pass the
exam.<p>

I will not be able to accept more than one submission of the project
per person, so wait until you are ready to submit the "real thing"
before you send your project to me.  If you work with someone else,
send me just one copy of the project.  There is nothing to be gained by
sending me the same thing from different people.<p>

You should precede each class and method with a javadoc comment block. 
Put in a sentence telling what the class or method does.  Be sure there
is a proper <I>javadoc</I> @author tag with your name in the comments
preceding the class definition.  Be sure you spell and capitalize the
tag exactly right (all lower case, no space between the "@" and
"author," and "author" spelled correctly).  The only things on the line
containing the @author tag must be (from left to right) an optional
asterisk, the tag, and your name.  See the sample code for Lecture 1
for an example of how to prepare this.<p>

For method definitions, put in @param and @return tags to tell what
parameters are passed to the method, and what value it returns.  There
should be a separate @param tag for each parameter (or none if there
are no parameters) that consists of the name of the parameter and what
it is used for.  The @return tag should just describe the value the
method returns, and may be omitted if the method's return type is
void.<p>

When your program is ready, <I>attach</I> your MP3FileInfo.java class
to an email message and send it to me at <CODE>vickery@qc.edu</CODE>. 
Be sure you send the file as an attachment or I won't be able to save,
compile, and run it.<p>

<H2>Introduction</H2>

This project will give you some practice working with files and objects
using Java.  To make things interesting, the files you will work with
will be "MP3" files, which hold music that can be played on a computer
or on any of several portable devices.  This Introduction gives you a
bit of background on MP3, but is not strictly needed to do the
project.  In later projects you will extend this program to let users
build a catalog of their music, and playlists that can be used by MP3
players to play sets of MP3 files.  If you are not interested in
learning about MP3 files, you can jump to the [&nbsp;<a
HREF="#project_description">Project Description</A>&nbsp;] further down
on this page.<p>

MP3 is a way of storing music (or other audio) in computer disk files. 
It's popular because there are programs that will convert music CDs
into MP3 format, which people then play on their computer or transfer
into portable MP3 walkman-like players.  The audio information is
compressed, so the files are relatively small (compared to a
non-compressed copy of the same audio information), making it possible
to transfer MP3 files over the Internet fairly easily.  Exchanging MP3
files over the net is illegal when copyrighted material is sent, but
otherwise is perfectly legal.<p>

If you don't already know about the software, free music, and hardware
that are available for dealing with MP3 encoded music, here are some
links for you:

  site provides links to a lot of useful other sites for additonal
  information about MP3.  It is also one of several sites that offers
  lots of free, legal MP3 files for downloading.

<H3>MP3 File Structure</H3>

[&nbsp;<a HREF="http://drogo.cselt.stet.it/mpeg/">The Moving Picture
Experts Group</A>&nbsp;] (MPEG) has developed a number of standards for
digital encoding of audio and visual information, including

<UL>
  <LI>MPEG-1, the standard for storage and retrieval of moving pictures
  and audio on storage media (approved Nov. 1992)
  <LI>MPEG-2, the standard for digital television (approved Nov.
  1994)
  <LI>MPEG-4 version 1, the standard for multimedia applications
  (approved Oct. 1998)
  <LI>MPEG-4 version 2 (to be approved December 1999)
  <LI>MPEG-7 the content representation standard for multimedia
  information search, filtering, management and processing (to be
  approved July 2001).
</UL>

Names like MPEG-1, MPEG-2, etc. are called "phases."  Within a phase,
there are several "layers."  MP3 refers to Layer III of MPEG Phase 1. 
What follows is a description of MP3 files, but you will see that the
information is encoded so that a program could process any of several
phases and layers.<p>

Think of an MP3 file as a steam of bytes.  The file is divided into a
sequence of audio frames followed by an optional section of textual
information.  We will be paying considerable attention to that textual
information, called the <I>ID3 tag</I>, which occupies exactly the last
128 bytes of an MP3 file if it is present.  But first some background on
the frames.<p>

<H4>Frames and Frame Headers</H4>

When audio information is stored digitally, the analog audio signal is
sampled periodically, and the intensity at each sample point is recorded
as a binary number.  If you later convert the binary numbers to voltages
and apply those voltages to an audio amplifier you will recreate the
original audio signal, thus reproducing the sound.  Three important
factor affect the fidelity of digital recordings: (1) How often the
original signal is sampled.  Audio CDs use a sample rate of 44 KHz,
which was chosen because it allows all pitches humans can hear to be
reproduced.  (2) How many bits are used for each sample.  The more bits
there are, the more accurately the amplitude of the signal is recorded. 
Using 8 bits per sample, for example, allows the recording to
differentiate among 256 different amplitudes for each sample.  Audio CDs
use 12 bits per sample (24 bits per sample for stereo).  (3) Compression
is a way of reducing the number of bits used to hold a recording.  MP3
uses a lossy compression scheme based on the psychoacoustic properties
of the audio signal.  That's a way of saying that MP3 throws away some
of the bits in a recording (that the "lossy" part), and it decides which
ones to lose based on what parts of the sound are most important to the
human hearing process (that's the psychoacoustic part).  The bottom line
on all this is that the more bits you keep in your recording, the closer
it approximates the quality of an audio CD.  But it turns out that a lot
of bits can be thrown out before most of us can hear the difference.<p>

MP3 files can be made from audio CDs or other sources with different
sampling frequencies and number of bits per sample.  Then the
information is encoded into MP3 form with a particular its
psychoacoustic compression algorithm, which uses some smaller number of
bits per sample compared to the original recording.  This process
results in a particular <I>bit rate</I>, the number of bits used to
encode each second of music.  MP3 bit rate values range from 8,000 (8K)
to 448,000 (448K) bits per second of music.  Good music fidelity can be
obtained with a bit rate of 64K, and "near CD quality) with rates above
300K.  Naturally, the higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 file for
a given piece of music.<p>

An MP3 file is divided into frames which contain 1152 samples each. 
Each frame has a <I>header</I>, which is four bytes of encoded
information that tells the frame's bit rate, whether it is monophonic or
stero, etc.  Normally, all the frames in an MP3 file are recorded the
same way so the frame headers all look alike, but there is a scheme
called variable bit rate encoding (VBR) that is sometimes used to vary
the bit rate for different parts of the file.  We will assume for our
projects that our MP3 files don't use VBR.<p>

The class MP3header that I am supplying examines the first MP3 frame
header in a file. The class constructor decodes the header information,
and the <I>showInfo()</I> method displays some of the information it
finds in a dialog box in a human readable form.<p>

<H4>ID3 Tags</H4>

The last 128 bytes of an MP3 may (or may not) contain textual
information describing the music that is encoded in the audio frames. 
This is where you'll find the name of the track, the artist's name, and
so on.  You can tell if a file has an ID3 tag by reading the last 128
bytes of the file and seeing if the first three of those bytes contain
the characters, "TAG".  Information on how to work with ID3 tags comes
in the [&nbsp;<a HREF="#extra_work">Extra Work</A>&nbsp;] part of this
page.<p>

<H2><a NAME="project_description">Project Description</A></H2>

Your program is to be a Java application that lets a user select a file
and view information about the contents of the file.  If the file is in
MP3 format, the program shows information about how the audio
information was encoded.  If the file contains an ID3 tag, the program
displays that information for the file too.<p>

The program runs in an endless loop that terminates when the user elects
not to select another file for viewing.  From the user's perspective,
the program works like this:

<ol>

    <LI>A dialog box appears that the user can use to select a file.

    <LI>When a file has been selected, a message box appears that tells
    the name and location of the file, its size, and information about
    how it is encoded if it is an MP3 file.

    <LI>Another message box appears.  If the file is an MP3 file, the
    message gives information about the ID3 information for the file. 
    Otherwise, the message says there is no ID3 information in the
    file. 

    <LI>When the user dismisses the second message box, the file
    selection box appears again and the user can select another file for
    viewing.  If the user clicks on the Cancel button or doesn't select
    any file when clicking on the OK button, the program exits.

</ol>

<H2>Working Version</H2>

You should download and run a working version of this project to become
familiar with it.  First create a directory on your computer that you
will use for developing this project, then click on [&nbsp;<a
HREF="Vickery_1.exe">Vickery_1.exe</A>&nbsp;] to extract three class files
into that directory.  <I>Notes on downloading:</I> If your browser asks
whether to download the file or run it in place, it's easier to run it
in place.  If you are nervous about running a file from my computer,
you can download it instead and scan it for viruses before running it. 
The file size is 36,578 bytes.  You should end up with three files,
with the sizes indicated, in your project directory:

<ul>
  <LI><CODE>MP3FileInfo.class</CODE> (1,168 bytes)
  <LI><CODE>ID3V1info.class</CODE> (4,405 bytes)
  <LI><CODE>MP3header.class</CODE> (4,776 bytes)
</ul>

To run the program, change to the project directory and type the
command, <b>java MP3FileInfo</b>.  To see what the program can do with
MP3, files, you need to have some on your computer.  If you click on
[&nbsp;<a HREF="Sample_MP3_Files">Sample MP3 Files</A>&nbsp;] you will
see a directory listing with some files you can download.  I picked
these samples because they are relatively small, but even so each one
is over a megabyte.  Most browsers will let you download the files
either by right clicking on a file name or by holding the shift key as
you click on a file name.  You can save these files any place on your
disk that you find convenient, then use my version of the program to
navigate to one of them.  Each time you select a file, the program will
put up two message boxes giving information about the file.  It will
work for any file, but the information is interesting only for MP3s.<p>

Your assignment is to write the equivalent of <CODE>MP3FileInfo</CODE>. 
The good news is that you are free to use the ID3V1info and MP3header
classes that I have supplied when you do your project.  These two
classes are the ones that actually process the information in the MP3
files and put up the messages boxes.  See below for more informaion.<p>

You need to study the documentation for all three of these classes.  Do that
by clicking on [&nbsp;<a HREF="doc/index.html">docs</A>&nbsp;], which
gives the documentation generated by <I>javadoc</I> for my code.<p>

<H2>Writing Your Program</H2>

You should have a project directory that contains my three class
files.  I recommend very strongly that you create a separate directory
some place on your disk just for this project so you can manage your
files better.  (I would create a directory named C:\My&nbsp;Projects
and a subdirectory named C:\My Projects\Project_1, but you may prefer
to organize your disk differently.)  In this same directory, create a
java application that defines the class MP3FileInfo.  The first time
you compile your program, your own MP3FileInfo.class file will replace
the one I supplied, but my MP3header and IDV1info classes will remain
in place, and your program will be able to use them.<p>

Using the sample code from Lecture 6 as a model, code your MP3FileInfo
application so that the user can select files.  If a file selected
actually exists, use the File object returned by
JFileChooser.<I>getSelectedFile()</I> to construct a new MP3header
object.  Use a reference to that object to call the MP3header method
<I>showInfo()</I>.  Each time your user selects a file, s/he should see
a dialog box giving information about how the recording was encoded. 
When that part of the program works, add the code to create an
ID3V1info object and call its <I>showInfo()</I> method.<p>

<H3><a NAME="extra_work">Extra Work</A></H3>

You can double your credit for this project by doing some extra work!<p>
 
But that's a joke!!  Because projects don't count towards your course
average at all, double credit is still nothing.  However, doing some
extra work is a good way to improve your programming skills, so here is
a description of some extra work you can do.<p>

You do not need to actually read from a file in order to do this
project.  In future projects we will be developing a program that can be
used to develop an MP3 library and MP3 playlists.  At the present time,
my plans for those projects will not require you to process the contents
of MP3 files in any way.  What you could do for extra work would be to
develop your own versions of MP3header and ID3V1info.  What follows is
some information to get you started on them.<p>

<H4>ID3 Tag and MP3 Header Processing</H4>

This web page is getting too long, so I'll put information about

Header Processing</A>&nbsp;] in a separate document.<p>
