<H1>Enumeration and Iteration</H1>
</center>

<H2><I>Note</I></H2>

You should be familiar with the JDK documentation for class
<CODE>java.util.Vector</CODE> and interface
<CODE>java.util.Enumeration</CODE> before you read this document.

<H2>Problem</H2>

Assume you have an object of class <CODE>java.util.Vector</CODE> and
you have added several objects to it using class Vector's
<I>addElement()</I> method.  That is, perhaps you have executed some
code that looks something like the following:<p>

<pre>
  Vector v = new Vector();
  &lt;<I>other code</I>&gt;
    v.addElement( ... );
    ...
</pre>

Now assume that you would like to do something with each of the
objects in the Vector.  You have two choices for getting each of the
objects, <I>enumeration</I> and <I>iteration</I>.  How do they work, and
which one is better?

<H2>Enumeration</H2>

Class Vector has a method named <I>elements()</I> that returns an
Enumeration.  Stated more carefully, <I>elements()</I> returns a
reference to an object that implements the
<CODE>java.util.Enumeration</CODE> interface.  That means you can use
the methods <I>hasMoreElements()</I> and <I>nextElement()</I> to
"enumerate over" the objects in the Vector, as follows:<p>

<pre>
  Enumeration e = v.elements();
  while ( e.hasMoreElements() ) {
    Object o = e.nextElement();
    // Do whatever it is you want to do with <I>o</I>.
    }
</pre>

The first time through the loop, <I>o</I> will be a reference to the
first object in the Vector, and successive times through the loop will
give you references to the succeeding objects in the Vector.<p>

<H2>Iteration</H2>

You could achieve exactly the same thing by "iterating" over the objects
in the Vector, as follows:<p>

<pre>
  for ( int i = 0; i &lt; v.size(); i++ ) {
    Object o = v.elementAt( i );
    // Do whatever it is you want to do with <I>o</I>.
    }
</pre>

<H2>Comparison of the Two</H2>

Most people find the iteration code easier to understand.  (There is
less of it to deal with, for one thing.)  The iteration code is also
somewhat more efficient because there is one less object being created
(the object that implements the Enumeration interface).<p>

So why bother with the enumeration technique at all?  There are
basically two answers:<p>

<OL>

  <LI>Enumeration is a standard programming pattern that you should be
  familiar with.  Other modern languages besides Java (such as C++)
  incorporate enumeration either in the language itself or through
  standard library facilities.<p>

  <LI>You can't always use iteration.  Class Vector is a special case
  because it supports both iteration and enumeration.  Iteration works
  here because the elements in a Vector really are kept in an array,
  which means that <I>elementAt()</I> can easily use indexing
  (subscripting) to get to the objects in the Vector.  But other
  classes that hold collections of objects do not keep them in an array
  internally, making indexing impossible to do.  Hash Tables and Linked
  Lists are the names of two other ways of storing collections of
  objects without using a simple array, for example.  For these other
  classes, you have no choice but to enumerate over their contents
  instead of iterating.<p>

</OL>

So, become comfortable with using the Enumeration interface, and
practice implementing it when you develop classes that hold collections
of objects.  Enumeration is an idiom of the Java language, and being
comfortable with this idiom will help your classes "talk" with other
programmers' classes.<p>
