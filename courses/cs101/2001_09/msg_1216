I am about to send you a message containing the "CUNY Online" survey I
mentioned during the last lecture, but it will appear to come from

  ajgartner@gc.cuny.edu

(I think!).  Please take the time to fill it out, giving your frank
answers to the questions, and return it to the apparent sender (the
ajgartner email address).  I've filled out the first 8 questions for
you to save some time.  It's debatable whether this course should
actually be considered to be an online course because we had almost a
full set of face to face class meetings, but I think they would
appreciate your answers to the questions in any event.

By the way, there is no regular questionnaire for the course this
term; I was mistaken when I said (during the last lecture) there would
be one.

See you at the final!
Dr. Vickery
