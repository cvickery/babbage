<h1>Study Guide for Exam 2</h1>
</center>

This study guide is a last-minute checklist for you to make sure there
aren't going to be any unexpected topics on the exam November 8.  You
should be able to answer short-answer questions about all these topics,
and to write code demonstrating your undertanding of them as well.

<h2>Exception Handling</h2>
<b>Chapter 14</b>.  The examples in the chapter make heavy use of GUI
components, but the basic concepts are all presented there.  Concepts
include:

<ul>

  <li><i>The <code>@throws</code> Javadoc tag.</i>  There should be one
  of these tags for each type of exception a method throws.  The tag
  should name the exception type and tell under what circumstances the
  exception might be thrown.

  <li><i>The throws clause.</i> if a method might throw any exceptions,
  put "throws" followed by a comma-separated list of exception types
  between the parameter list and the opening brace of the method
  definition.
  
  <li><i>The throw operator.</i>  Used inside a method to throw an
  exception.  The single operand on the right must be a reference to an
  object of class Exception or one of its subclasses.
  
  <li><i>try, catch, and finally.</i>  Syntax covered in lecture and in
  the book.  There can be multiple catch clauses; the finally clause is
  optional.  Know the ordering of multiple catch clauses (according to
  class hierarchy.)
 
  <li>Be able to define and use new subclasses of Exception.  (Code
  given in lecture.)

</ul>  

<h2>I/O Processing</h2>

You should be able to use the following classes and at least some of
their methods (the methods used in assignments/lectures):
<ul>
  <li>java.io.File
  <li>java.io.BufferedReader
  <li>java.io.FileInputStream
  <li>java.io.DataInputStream
  <li>java.io.IOException
</ul>

<h2>Class File Assignment</h2>

Know the differences and similarities between text and binary files.  Be
able to read binary information, either signed or unsigned, from a class
file (or other binary data file).  Know the sizes of the various Java
primitive data types.  Understand sign extension.  Be comfortable with
hexadecimal representation of binary values.  Know what the magic number
at the beginning of class files is.
