Here is our HelloCL class, updated to put it in a package named
edu.queens.vickery.  If you compile it with "javac -d . HelloCL.java," a
directory tree starting at "." (the current directory) will be created.
The top of the tree will be a directory named edu, queens will be a
subdirectory of edu, and vickery will be a subdirectory of queens.
HelloCL.class will be in the vickery subdirectory.<p>

To run the program from the current directory, the command line would
be:
<pre>
      java edu.queens.vickery.HelloCL My Name
</pre>

        <b>package edu.queens.vickery;</b>
     
        public class HelloCL
        {
          public static void main( String[] args )
          {
            System.out.print( "Hello" );
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; args.length; i++)
            {
              System.out.print( " " + args[ i ] );
            }
            System.out.println( ", my name is Dr. Vickery" );
            System.out.println( "There were " + args.length +
            " arguments.");
            System.exit( 0 );
          }
        }
