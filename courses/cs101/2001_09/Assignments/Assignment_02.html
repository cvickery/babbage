<h1>CS-101 Assignment 2</h1>

<h2>Due Date</h2>

Email this assignment to me by <b>midnight September 13</b>.<br>
Note, however, that I will be out of town until the 20th, and I will not
be able to acknowledge receipt of your assignment until I return.  So
don't worry about whether your email was delivered or not while I am
gone.<p>

Be sure the Subject of your mail message is "CS-101 Assignment 2"
(without the quotes), and that the body of your message contains your
name and student ID number.<p>


<h2>Assignment</h2>

This is an exercise in formatting and documenting programs and
submitting them correctly.<p>

Your assignment is to send me an email message with a <i>jar</i> (or
<i>zip</i> file attached.  The <i>jar</i> file is to contain two .java
files: <code>HelloCL.java</code> and <code>HelloGUI.java</code>.  I am
supplying you with the code for both programs:

<ul>
    <li>[&nbsp;<a href="html/HelloGUI.java.html">HelloCL.java</a>&nbsp;]
    <li>[&nbsp;<a href="html/HelloCL.java.html">HelloCL.java</a>&nbsp;]
</ul>

I have documented HelloGUI using proper <i>javadoc</i> commenting style.
You are to type both programs (don't cut and paste the web pages, the
idea is for you to practice proper use of a text editor), and you are to
add proper javadoc comments to HelloCL.  Be sure the
comments you add describe this program accurately.<p>

Change my name to yours in both programs, and be sure both programs
compile and run properly before submitting the assignment.<p>

Be sure your code is properly spaced and indented, that no lines (not
even comments) extend past column 72, and that there are no tab
characters in your code.
