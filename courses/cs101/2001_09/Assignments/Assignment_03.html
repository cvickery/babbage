<h1>CS-101 Assignment 3</h1>
</center>

<h2>Description</h2>

The assignment is to develop a class hierarchy that can be used to
obtain and print the user's name in various ways.<p>

The base class is to be an <i>abstract</i> class named <b>Hello</b>. 
This class is to provide the following:

<ul>
  <li>A protected String named <i>msg</i>.
  <li>A <i>toString()</i> method which overrides the <i>toString()</i>
  method inherited from class Object.  This method is to return the
  value of <i>msg</i>.
  <li>A public static void main method, the logic of which is described
  below.
</ul>

One subclass of Hello is to be named <b>HelloGUI</b>.  It is to have
just one constructor, a no-arg constructor which uses JOptionPane to
ask the user to enter his/her name.  The constructor is to initialize
<i>msg</i> to the String, "Hello, xxx, my name is yyy." where xxx is to
be replaced by the String returned by the JOptionPane, and yyy is to be
your own name.  This class does <i>not</i> implement any methods or
define any instance variables.<p>

A second subclass of Hello is to be named <b>HelloCL</b>.  It is to
have just one constructor, which receives a reference to an array of
strings (<i>i.e.</i>, String[]).  This constructor is to initialize the
variable <i>msg</i> to the String, "Hello xxx, my name is yyy.".  In
this case, xxx is to be replaced with the concatenation of all the
Strings in the array passed to it, separated by spaces, and yyy is to
be your own name.  This class does <i>not</i> implement any methods or
define any instance variables.<p>

A third subclass of Hello is to be named <b>HelloBR</b>.  It is to have just
one constructor, a no-arg constructor which uses a BufferedReader to
ask the user to enter his/her name.  The constructor is to initialize
<i>msg</i> to the String, "Hello, xxx, my name is yyy." where xxx is to
be replaced by the String returned by the BufferedReader's
<i>readLine()</i> method, and yyy is to be your own name.  This class
does <i>not</i> implement any methods or define any instance
variables.<p>

<h2>The Hello.<i>main()</i> Method</h2>

The user will run the application using the command line,
"java&nbsp;Hello&nbsp;xxx", which will cause the superclass to be loaded
(but not instantiated) and it's <i>main()</i> method to run.  What this
method does depends on what the user types in place of "xxx" on the
command line:

<ul>

    <li>If xxx is nothing (args.length is 0), create an object of class HelloBR.

    <li>If xxx is the single string "ask" (args.length is 1 and args[0]
    equals "ask"), create an object of class HelloGUI.

    <li>If xxx is anything else, use the args parameter to create an
    object of class HelloCL.

</ul>

After creating the object, print it.  Note that the following two
statements are equivalent; you may use either version in your program:

<pre>
    System.out.println( o );
    System.out.println( o.toString() );
</pre>

<h2>Using BufferedReader</h2>

We haven't covered class BufferedReader yet, but the slides for Lecture
10 include sample code you can use to read a string from the user as the
program runs.  The code looks a bit messy because the BufferedReader
constructor takes an object of class Reader as it's argument, and
System.in (the object reference used to read from the user) can't be
used directly because it is of type InputStream.  The code in the slides
is equivalent to the following:

<pre>
    try
    {
      InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader( System.in );
      BufferedReader    br  = new BufferedReader( isr );
      msg = br.readLine();
    }
    catch ( IOException ioe )
    {
      System.err.println( ioe );
      System.exit( 1 );
    }
</pre>

The try/catch statements are needed to handle the possible exceptions
that might be caused by the I/O operations.  We will cover those after
the exam.<p>

The InputStreamReader constructor receives the InputStream, System.in,
and gives us an object that is a subclass of class Reader, so it can be
used as the argument passed to the BufferedReader constructor.  The
code in the slides eliminates the variable <i>isr</i> because it is
never needed again in the program.  It's more compact and more efficient
than the code above, but a bit more obscure.  You can use either type of
code in your program.

<h2>Developing and Testing Your Program</h2>

Create four files for this assignment, Hello.java, HelloBR.java,
HelloCL.java, and HelloGUI.java.<p>

Start by coding Hello.java, but leave the main method empty.  Then
create class HelloGUI, and add the code to Hello.<i>main()</i> that
tests to see if a HelloGUI object is to be created, and do so if
appropriate.  But if args[0] is not "ask", just exit the program
without doing anything.  Test to be sure this version of the program
"works" no matter what you type on the "java&nbsp;Hello" command
line.<p>

Now write HelloCL.java and add the code to Hello.<i>main()</i> to test
if args.length is greater than zero <i>after</i> the test if args.length
is 1 and args[0] is "ask."  If args.length is 0, just exit the program
without doing anything. Test to be sure this version of the program
"works" no matter what you type on the "java&nbsp;Hello" command
line.<p>

Finally, write HelloBR.java and add the code to Hello.<i>main()</i> to
create a HelloBR object if args.length is zero. Test to be sure this
version of the program "works" no matter what you type on the
"java&nbsp;Hello" command line.<p>

To simplify your code, remember that any object you create will be a
subclass of your abstract superclass, Hello.  You don't need a different
variable for each object reference.  For example, the following
statement is perfectly legal:

<pre>
      Hello h = new HelloGUI();
</pre>

<h2>Submit The Assignment</h2>

When you have the program properly coded and tested, put the four .java
files in a jar file named Assignment_03.jar and send it to me as an
email attachment.  Remember: your code must be properly formatted (no
tabs, no lines longer than 72 characters), properly indented, and must
have proper <i>javadoc</i> comments for all classes and methods,
including proper @author, @param, and @return <i>javadoc</i> tags.<i>

The assignment is due by <b>midnight, October 23.</b><p>
