<h1>Sample Class FIle</h1>
</center>

Here are links to three views of a Java Class.

<ol>

  <li>The first view is the <i>source code</i> for a class named
  [&nbsp;<a href="./HexDump.java.html">HexDump.java</a>&nbsp;]<p>

  <li>When the class is compiled, the compiler will generate a <i>class
  file</i> named [&nbsp;<a
  href="./HexDump.dump.html">HexDump.class</a>&nbsp;].  The class file
  is made up of both printable and non-printable binary information. 
  The link takes you to a web page that shows the contents of the class
  file using hexadecimal shorthand for the binary information in the
  center part, and the equivalent characters on the right. 
  (Non-printable bytes are shown as dots on the right.)  The lefthand
  column is the offset from the beginning of the file for each line.<p>
  As you might guess, the web page was generated by running the HexDump
  application on its own class file:
  <code>java&nbsp;HexDump&nbsp;HexDump.class</code>.

  <li>For the ClassFile assignment, your program is to read a class
  file and save it in a form suitable for "exploring" using a graphical
  user interface.  The web page, [&nbsp;<a
  href="HexDump.out.html">HexDump.out</a>&nbsp;] shows the values of
  the first parts of the class file as captured by preliminary versions
  of ClassFile and ConstantPoolEntry.  The "production" versions of
  these classes don't actually print anything out.  The very last line
  is all that would be output by the <i>main()</i> method for
  Assignment 4.
