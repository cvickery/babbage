<h1>Assignment 4</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is the first part of a multi-part assignment, which will
ultimately allow a user to examine the contents of Java class files. 
Material given in this assignment about the structure of Java class
files is also available on the web at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/index.html">
http://java.sun.com/docs/books/vmspec/index.html</a>.  A more
accessible form is provided in the book, <i>Inside the Java 2 Virtual
Machine</i> by Bill Venners (McGraw-Hill, 1999).

<h2>This Assignment</h2>

Write a class named ClassFile which extends class java.io.File.  The
constructor for this class is to receive a String giving the pathname of
a class file.  After invoking the superclass' constructor that takes the
same String, the constructor is to verify that the class file is a valid
Java class file by performing the following tests:

<ul>
  <li>The file name passed to the constructor must refer to a file that
  is readable by the user.
  <li>The filename must end with ".class"
  <li>The first four bytes of the file must contain the value
  0xCAFEBABE.
</ul>

If any of these tests fails, the constructor is to thow a
ClassFileException object with an appropriate message associated with
it.  Put the definition of class ClassFileException in a separate .java
file. Encountering end of file at any point while reading the file
should also cause the constructor to throw a ClassFileException with an
appropriate message.<p>

If all the tests pass, read the file's minor version number and major
version number, which are two-byte unsigned integer values.  Save them
in ClassFile instance variables with appropriate names.<p>

Next, read another two-byte unsigned integer value that tells how many
entries there are in the constant pool.  Create an array of
ConstantPoolEntry objects of this length.  Then create the actual
ConstantPoolEntry objects for the array.  The constructor for the
ConstantPoolEntry class reads the information from the file in order to
initialize each object.<p>

<ul>

  <li>The structure of ConstantPoolEntry information in the class file
  is described in [&nbsp;<a href="ConstantPoolEntries.html">the
  ConstantPoolEntries web page</a>&nbsp;]

  <li>The design of the ConstantPoolEntry class is described [&nbsp;<a
  href="#cp_entry">below</a>&nbsp;]

</ul>

After the constant pool, read the following two-byte unsigned integer
values:

<ol>
  <li>access_flags
  <li>this_class
  <li>super_class
  <li>intefaces_count
  <li>interfaces[]
</ol>

Note that interfaces is an array of values, and that the length of the
array is given by interfaces_count.<p>

Following the above information, there are three more arrays, each of
which is preceded by a two-byte count giving the size of the array:

<ul>
  <li>fields_count and an array of FieldInfo objects
  <li>methods_count and an array of MethodInfo objects
  <li>attibutes_count and an array of AttributeInfo objects 
</ul>

Classes FieldInfo, MethodInfo, and AttributeInfo will be described later
if we need them.<p>

The following table summarizes the values that will be found in the
access_flags field, which will contain the sum (actually, the bit-wise
OR) of any number of the values listed here:<p>

<table align=center width=80% cellpadding=5 border=1>
  <tr>
    <th>Flag Name
    <th>Value
    <th>Interpretation
    <th>Where used

  <tr>
    <td>ACC_PUBLIC
    <td>0x0001
    <td>Declared public; may be accessed from outside its package.
    <td>Classes and interfaces

  <tr>
    <td>ACC_FINAL
    <td>0x0010
    <td>Declared final; no subclasses allowed.
    <td>Classes only

  <tr>
    <td>ACC_SUPER
    <td>0x0020
    <td>Treat superclass methods specially when invoked by the
    <i>invokespecial</i> instruction.
    <td>Classes and interfaces

  <tr>
    <td>ACC_INTERFACE
    <td>0x0200
    <td>Type is an interface, not a class.
    <td>All interfaces, no classes

  <tr>
    <td>ACC_ABSTRACT
    <td>0x0400
    <td>Type is abstract; may not be instantiated.
    <td>All interfaces, some classes
</table>


<h2>The <i>toString()</i> Method</h2>

Class ClassFile is to have a <i>toString()</i> method which returns a
string in the form "xxx:M.m" where <i>xxx</i> is the name of the class
defined in the class file, <i>M</i> is the major_version of the file,
and <i>m</i> is the minor version of the file.

<h2>The <i>main()</i> Method</h2>

For testing purposes, provide class ClassFile with a main method which
creates a new ClassFile object for each file name supplied on the
<i>java</i> command line.  For each ClassFile object created
successfully, print the value returned by its <i>toString()</i>
method.  If the user types a file name that does not turn out to be a
valid class file, catch the ClassFileException thrown by the
constuctor, print the message associated with it, and continue on to
the next class file on the command line, if any.

<a name="cp_entry"><h2>Class ConstantPoolEntry</h2></a>

The constructor for ConstantPoolEntry is to receive a reference to a
DataInputStream Object, read the next byte from that stream, which will
be the tag for the next entry in the constant pool.  Save the tag in a
private instance variable, but provide a public getConstantType() method
that lets user classes get this value as an int.  Save the information
associated with the tag in other instance fields.  Provide a
<i>toString()</i> method that returns the name of the constant type and
the value(s) associated with it.  Any tag value other than those listed
in the [&nbsp;<a href="./ConstantPool.html">ConstantPool.html</a>&nbsp;]
web page should cause the constructor to throw a RuntimeException with a
"bad tag" message.<p>

The constructor for class ClassFile could profitably print a message
giveing each constant pool index and the value returned by its
ConstantPoolEntry's <i>toString()</i> method during development.  These
messages should be written to System.err so they will be synchronized
with any RuntimeException messages that happen to get thrown.
