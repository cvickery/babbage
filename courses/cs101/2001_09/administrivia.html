<h2>Textbooks</h2>

There is one textbook for the course:

  <tr>
    <td>

    Deitel, H. M. and Deitel, P. J.<br>
    <i>Java How to Program</i><br>
    Prentice Hall, 2001<br>
    ISBN 0-201-43664-7 (Third Edition)<br>
    ISBN 0-13-034151-7 (Fourth Edition)<p>

</table></center>

  This course assumes you have already covered chapters 1-7,
  and will cover material from chapters 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
  13, 14, 15, and 17 (third edition) or 16 (fourth edition).
  You can safely use either the third or fourth edition, but
  no edition earlier than the third.<p>
  Reading assignments are on the [&nbsp;<a
  href="./schedule.html">Course Schedule</a>&nbsp;] web page.

<h2>Homework and Exams</h2>
</a>

<ul>
  
  <li>There will be several homework assignments, but they
  will count only 5% of your course grade.  That is, if
  there are five homework assignments, each one will count
  1% of your course average.<p>

  You must submit your own homework solutions, but you are
  free to work on the homework assignments with anyone you
  wish; the idea is to use the homework as a way to practice
  the material covered in the course, not as a test of your
  knowledge.  I will record whether or not you hand in
  homeworks by the assigned due dates.  I will provide you
  with feedback on your assignments insofar as I have time
  to do so, and will provide copies of "correct" solutions
  to the exercises as well.<p>

  <li>There will be two midterm exams and a final exam.  The
  two midterms will count 30% each, and the final will count
  35%.  Each exam will cover approximately 1/3 of the course
  (see the [&nbsp;<a href="./schedule.html">Course
  Schedule</a>&nbsp;] web page for dates), and the final
  exam will include some reveiw material from earlier parts
  of the course (about 15% of the exam).<p>

  If your lowest exam score is ten points or less below your
  middle exam score, its weight will be reduced by 10% and
  the weights of the other two exams will be increased by 5%
  each.<p>

  Exams will be a mixture of short answer questions plus a
  significant amount of code writing.  The code you write
  will test how well you have mastered the programming
  concepts in the assignments you have done.  Note, however,
  that it will not work if you just memorize code, because
  the exam questions will be different from the assignment
  solutions.
  
</ul>

<h2>Check Your Grades</h2>

  You can check the scores I have recorded for your homework and exams
  at the [&nbsp;<a href="check_grades.html">Check Grades</a>&nbsp;] web
  page.  To use this facility, you will need to enter your student ID
  number and a "code word."  The code word is like a password, but it
  is not as secure as a real password because you must tell me what it
  is in order to set it up.  (<b>Never send a real password to anyone,
  not even a professor!</b>)  See [&nbsp;<a
  href="./Assignments/Assignment_1.html">Homework Assignment
  1</a>&nbsp;] for details.<p>

  Grades become permanent and cannot be changed two weeks after they
  are posted, so be sure to monitor your grades regularly to be sure
  they are recorded correctly.
