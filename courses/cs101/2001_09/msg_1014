As I mentioned in lecture, it might be helpful to work on Assignment 3
as part of your preparation for the exam on Tuesday.  The course
schedule web page:
  http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs101/2001_09/schedule.html
now has a link to the web page for the assignment.  But the assignment
includes the use of a new class, BufferedReader, that we have not
discussed yet, so I wouldn't bother working on that part of the
assignment before the exam.  The assignment is designed so you can work
on just part of it now, and then finish it after the exam.
