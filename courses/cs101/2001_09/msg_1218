Here is a list of topics for you to review for the final exam:

  Concepts and terminology for GUI applications (callback methods,
  listener classes, event handling, components, containers, layout
  managers), be familiar with frames, menus, panels, checkboxes,
  labels and buttons, coding anonymous inner classes, reading binary
  files using DataInputStream.  You should remember how to manage code
  and invoke constructors, extend classes, manage exceptions,
  implement interfaces, extend classes, and use arrays from earlier in
  the semester.  You should be able to use class Vector, knowing the
  difference between Vectors and arrays.

Writing code is one good way to prepare for the exam.  Remember that a
large portion of the exam will involve writing code.  There will be
some reference material available so that, for example, you do not need
to memorize the name of the Listener interface and the names of the
methods in each Listener interface for each type of component. (But
you need to know how to use them.)
