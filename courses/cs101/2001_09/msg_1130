I have just posted the slides from November 29 on the web, and I'd like
to point out that the sample programs for that lecture
(WindowListener_ex.java) and the previous one
(RealSimpleApplication.java) are very important to study.  You would
learn the most if you actually type them in and compile/run them, but
second best would be just to cut-and-paste them, and then compile/run
them.

In particular, note that WindowsListener_ex now prints the names of all
the active threads at various points during the execution of the
program, which should help you understand event handling better, I
think.
