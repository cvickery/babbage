  The web page for Assignment 2 is up. The due date is not until next Tuesday to
  be sure you have time to get it working. Some of you (you know who you are!)
  have not submitted Assignment 1 yet. You have to get caught up now or the
  course will not work out.

  See you Thursday. The good news is that once you get this set-up step working,
  the remainder of the programming will be relatively straight-forward.
