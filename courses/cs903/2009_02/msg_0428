  I have to recind my offer to let you access your databases from outside the
  lab: I forgot that the college firewall blocks the internet port (5432) needed
  for accessing it. Getting the firewall to grant an exception is a bureaucratic
  exercise that might not get resolved by the end of the semester anyway. But it
  should be open to any computer on campus, not just the computers in the lab,
  now.

  Also, I started the web page for assignment 6 and put the information about
  error management in there. You do not have to include error management in your
  code for Assignment 5.
