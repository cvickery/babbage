<h1>Using SQLite3 with PHP</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>  SQLite3 is a <em>database management system</em> (DBMS) that provides a
  “lightweight” mechanism for developing database applications. It is
  not designed for a production environment, but is very well-suited for
  student projects in the undergraduate course on script programming for
  the web.</p>

<p>  This document presents a working subset of the full SQLite3 package
  available in PHP. For more details and information about other SQLite3
  features available, consult the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.sqlite3.php">PHP
  Manual</a> and the SQLite3
  documentation at <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite.org</a>.</p>

<p>  The PHP support for SQLite3 uses PHP’s <em>Object Oriented Programming</em>
  (OOP) features, and you should consult <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.basic.php">that part of the PHP
  manual</a> in order
  to understand the syntax described here.</p>

<h2>SQLite3</h2>

<p>  The following functions should serve your needs for the projects in
  this course:</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>$db_handle  = new SQLite3($filename);
$db_handle-&gt;exec($query_string);
$result     = $db_handle-&gt;query($query_string);
$row        = $result-&gt;fetchArray();
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>  The <code>$filename</code> parameter is a string that points to your database
  file. The file and the directory that contains it must both be
  writeable by the web server. The <code>$db_handle</code> that is returned is
  an object that serves much the same purpose as the <em>resource</em> returned
  when you open a file or directory using <code>fopen()</code> or <code>opendir()</code>.</p>

<p>  The <code>exec()</code> and <code>query()</code> functions both submit a string containing
  an SQL statement (see below) to the database for processing. The
  difference is that <code>exec()</code> doesn’t return a value, and thus is most
  appropriate for SQL statements like <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>,
  <code>DELETE</code> or <code>DROP</code>. But <code>query()</code> is used for <code>SELECT</code> statements,
  which return values from the database. The <code>$result</code> value returned is
  another type of PHP object, which you use for accessing the actual
  data returned by the query.</p>

<p>  The <code>fetchArray()</code> function returns one row from the results returned
  by <code>query()</code>, or <code>false</code> if there are no (more) rows. The <code>$row</code> value
  returned is an array with one element for each column in the row
  returned. Use can index into that array using the name of a database
  table column. See examples below.</p>

<h2>SQL Statements</h2>

<p>  Database design and the SQL language are big topics. What follows is
  an annotated description of some statements that should serve to get
  you started. <em>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing</em>, so please
  don’t try to extrapolate from this little example to the real world
  without doing some research on how to set up and use relational
  databases effectively.</p>

<p>  SQL statements consist of <em>keywords</em> and <em>arguments</em> along with some
  syntax characters. Keywords are conventionally written in uppercase
  letters for readability, but lowercase versions work just fine. Values
  are enclosed in single quotes if they are strings, but not if
  they are numbers. SQLite3 does not enforce data types the way most
  database systems do. It’s more like PHP, where a cell in a table can
  hold either a number or a string without complaint.</p>

<p>  SQL comments start with a double-dash, and continue to the end of the
  line. They are ignored by the database, but are used below to add some
  commentary to the examples.</p>

<p>  The semicolon at the end of an SQL statement is optional when
  submitting a query string to <code>exec()</code> or <code>query()</code>.</p>

<p>  If you were to install SQLite3 on your computer, you could run the
  SQLite3 interpreter from the command line, and type the following
  commands and see them execute interactively:</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>--  Create a table, if it does not aleady exist. It will consist of
--  two columns, named `username` and `password`, both of which are
--  strings. The `username` column is declared to be the _primary key_
--  for the table, which means that each row in the table must have a
--  unique value.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    username STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    password STRING);

--  Add a user named _John_ to the users table
INSERT INTO users VALUES ( 'John', 'secret' );

--  Add another user named _Mary_ to the users table
INSERT INTO users VALUES ( 'Mary', 'notsosecret' );

--  And a third user...
INSERT INTO users VALUES ( 'Chris', 'secret');

--  Get all the data from all the users. This query will return
--  three rows, with two columns in each row.
SELECT * FROM users;
--  Using the PHP code given above, after calling `fetchArray()`
--  once, `$row['username']` will be _John_ and `$row['password']`
--  will be _secret_.

--  Lookup _Chris_. Note that the single equal sign is for
--  comparison, not assignment.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'Chris';

--  Lookup everyone who has 'secret' as a password, no matter how
--  it’s capitalized. This query will return two rows.
SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower(password) = 'secret';

--  Change Chris’ password
UPDATE users
   SET password = 'Very Secret'
 WHERE username = 'Chris';

--  Remove John by using his password. Would also delete Chris
--  if his password was still `secret`.
DELETE FROM users WHERE password = 'secret';
</code></pre>

<h2>PHP Example</h2>

<p>  The following sequence of PHP statements illustrate the use of SQLite3
  on a PHP web page that receives form data sent by the <em>post</em> method.
  It is not intended as a real application, just a demonstration of
  using the various constructs described above.</p>

<hr />

<pre><code>$db = new SQLite3('my_database') or die('Unable to open database');
$query = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    username STRING PRIMARY KEY,
    password STRING)
EOD;
$db-&gt;exec($query) or die('Create db failed');
$user = sanitize($_POST['username']);
$pass = sanitize($_POST['password']);
$query = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOD
  INSERT INTO users VALUES ( '$user', '$pass' )
EOD;
$db-&gt;exec($query) or die("Unable to add user $user");
$result = $db-&gt;query('SELECT * FROM users') or die('Query failed');
while ($row = $result-&gt;fetchArray())
{
  echo "User: {$row['username']}\nPasswd: {$row['password']}\n";
}
</code></pre>
