1. 3 is a number (value: 3).
2. xanadu is a string (value: 3).
3. xanadu is a string (value: 33).
4. xanadu is a number (value: 0).
5. Question 3 illustrates string concatenation, while Question 4 illustrates arithemetic subtraction. 
JavaScript converts numbers to strings where possible, but if necessary, it will convert strings to numbers.
6. The value of xanadu is 3 and its type is number.
7. The value of xanadu is NaN and its type is number.
8. Question 6 subtracts the numeric value of xanadu (0) from 3 and produces the numeric result, 3.
But Question 7 tries to subtract a string that cannot be converted to a number from 3, and cannot;
the result is not a number, which is the special number NaN.
9a. NaN is a number and its value is NaN.
9b. 'NaN' is a string and its value is NaN.
9c. Nan is a object and its value is .
NaN is a special numeric literal which displays as NaN.
'NaN' is a string; strings always display as themselves.
Nan is a variable holding an empty array, so there is no value to display; arrays are actually specialized objects.
10. The type of Nan is object.
11. Assigning any number, such as 123, to Nan[0], its type becomes number.
12. The value of 1.23E2 is 123 and its type is number.
Before Question 13, The type of Nan[3] is undefined, and Nan.length is 1.
13. The type of Nan[3] is function, and Nan.length is 4.
14. The type of {} is object.
