      <h2>Description</h2>
      <div class="whitebox">
        <p>The assignment is to implement the client-side scripting functions of the web page at <a
        href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/Contours"> http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/Contours</a>, but using
        the library functions provided by the textbook for setting up the event handler function.
        Use web page to be sure you understand what calculations it it performing based on the four
        text input values.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Procedure</h2>
      <div class="whitebox">
        <ol>

          <li>
            <h5>Log into your account and set up your site for the course.</h5>
            <p class="run_in">You may do your assignments anywhere you like, but they must be
            available for me to grade from your account in the lab. So start by logging into your
            lab account and setting up your site there. You don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to use
            Dreamweaver, but I will be assuming that you do.</p>
            
          <p>You can log into any one of the computers in SB room A-205 or A-227 using your account name
            for this course, which consists of your last name followed by the digits
            &ldquo;903&rdquo; all as a single lower-case string. Use the password &ldquo;903&rdquo;; you will
            be required to change it to something secure the first time you log in.</p>

          <p>The names of the computers are:</p>

          <table  summary="Lists of computer names in A-205 and A-227." id="computers">
            <tr> <th>A-205</th>     <th>A-227</th>    </tr>
            <tr> <td>birch</td>     <td>apple</td>    </tr>
            <tr> <td>cherry</td>    <td>fir</td>      </tr>
            <tr> <td>chestnut</td>  <td>juniper</td>  </tr>
            <tr> <td>elm</td>       <td>mimosa</td>   </tr>
            <tr> <td>ginkgo</td>    <td>peach</td>    </tr>
            <tr> <td>hemlock</td>   <td>pine</td>     </tr>
            <tr> <td>hickory</td>   <td>plum</td>     </tr>
            <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>spruce</td>   </tr>
            <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>sycamore</td> </tr>
            <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td>    <td>walnut</td>   </tr>
          </table>

          <p>Room 205 is an &ldquo;open lab,&rdquo; which means you can use the computers there any time you want. The
          secretaries in the CS Department Office (A-202) will open the lab for you if it is closed. Room 227 is a
          closed lab, so you will not be able to sit at the computers in that room to use them. However, all of the
          computers are accessible from the Internet. If you have access to a computer running Windows XP or Vista with
          a broadband connection, you can use <span class="programName">Remote Desktop </span> to log in. From the <span
          class="menuItem">Start</span> button, go to <span class="menuItem">Programs</span>, to <span
          class="menuItem">Accessories</span>, to <span class="menuItem">Communications</span>, and you will find it.
          When it asks you what computer you want to connect to, pick one of the names above and add the domain name
          &ldquo;.cs.qc.edu&rdquo; to the computer name. For example, you would log into <span
          class="computerName">ginkgo</span> by entering <span class="computerName">ginkgo.cs.qc.edu</span>.</p>

          <p>If you are using a Macintosh, OS X comes with a Remote Desktop program you can use in the same
            way as the Windows version. Under preferences, be sure to set a screen size and resolution to
            match your computer&rsquo;s screen. The default value is very low resolution, making it difficult
            to use.</p>

          <p>There an open source version of Remote Desktop at <a
          href="http://www.rdesktop.org">www.rdesktop.org</a> that might be useful if you are
          running Linux. But I have had no experience with it.</p>

          <p class="standoutBlock">When you use Remote Desktop, select one of the computers in A-227 so that students
          who are on campus will be able to use the computers in A-205. Only one person can use a computer at a time, so
          if the computer you try is occupied, just try another one until you find one that is available.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Set up your Dreamweaver site as described in class.</h5>
            <p class="runin">Create a directory under your <span class="directoryName">My Website</span> folder, and
            name it <span class="directoryName">Assignment_01</span> for this assignment. Capitalization and exact
            spelling matter here because I will be retrieving your project using a script that will assume your project
            is located in exactly that folder.</p>

            <p>If you work from off-campus, you should be able to copy your site to a lab computer using <span
            class="programName">WinSCP</span> (Windows), <span class="programName">Fugu</span> (OS-X), or <span
            class="programName">ssh</span> (Linux/Unix). If you are logged into a lab computer via Remote Desktop, you
            can copy files to your "home" directory, which is actually on maple regardless of which computer in the lab
            you are logged into. Then, from in your lab account, you can copy those files from your H: drive to your My
            Website folder.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Unzip <a href="Assignment_01.zip">the Contours web page and style sheet</a> into your project directory
            for the assignment.</h5>
            <p class="runin">Verify that you can deploy the web page and its style sheet, but note that the page
            doesn&rsquo;t do anything because you don&rsquo;t have any script files yet.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h5>Examine the existing script files for the page on <span class="computerName">babbage</span>.</h5>
            <p class="runin">In keeping with <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#minify"><span
            class="programName">YSlow</span> Rule #10</a>, the script files have been &ldquo;minified&rdquo;, making
            them difficult to read. The un-minified files are in a <a
            href="http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/Contours/scripts/src">subdirectory of <span
            class="directoryName">scripts</span></a>. Set up your own <span class="directoryName">scripts</span>
            directory under <span class="directoryName">Assignment_01</span> and download my un-minified source code there; verify
            that the web page now works correctly.</p>
          </li>

					<li>
            <h5>Implement your own JavaScript code, based on the library presented in the textbook.</h5>
            <p class="runin">Create a <span class="directoryName">scripts</span> directory under <span
            class="directoryName">My Website</span>, copy <span class="fileName">core.js</span> from the
            textbook&rsquo;s code archive there, and put a <span class="tagName">script</span> tag at the bottom of the
            project index page to include it. Then create  a script file named <span
            class="fileName">mycontours.js</span> in <span class="pathName">Assignment_01/scripts</span>, and create a link
            to <span class="fileName">mycontours.js</span>
            from a second <span class="tagName">script</span> tag at the bottom of the index page. Create a class named
            <span class="className">Contours</span> with an <span class="functionName">init()</span> function that
            displays an <span class="functionName">alert()</span>, and register the class with <span
            class="className">Core</span>. Be sure the alert message gets displayed when you load the page.</p>
            <p>Now Proceed to implement the functionality of my code in your own code. You may &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; as much
            of my code as you like so long as you use the textbook&rsquo;s event handling model. You might want to consult the
            <a href="../ECMA-262.pdf">JavaScript Reference Manual</a> (<img src="../../../images/pdf.png" alt="PDF"/> 705 KB;
            188 pages) to find out details about the language, but the textbook is probably an easier resource to work with.</p>

            <h5>Add feedback when the user enters incorrect or incomplete values in the <span class="tagName">input</span> fields.
            </h5>
            <p class="runin">Make the background color light red when a text field contains an invalid value, and light green when it is
            valid.</p>

        (There should be one broken link that you will need to fix.)</p>
        
        <p>If necessary, copy your site from your development system to the lab as described above, and do a final check of your project using the
        <span class="codeSnippet">~</span>&lt;accountname&gt; form of URL. Then send email to me telling me the project is ready for me to grade.
