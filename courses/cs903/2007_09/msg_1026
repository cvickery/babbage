  I have uploaded the web page for Assignment 2 and once
  again changed the due date -- Good Luck!

  Also, I have received announcements of several internships
  that are available through the CUNY Institute for Software
  Design and Development (CISDD). Contact
  Kara.Heffernan@domino1.cuny.edu if you are interested.
  
  And check out
  http://qcpages.qc.cuny.edu/Library/info/webtechjob.html
  for a part-time opening for a web developer at the
  Library. They contacted the department specifically to see
  if we have any students interested.

  See you next week,
  Dr. Vickery
