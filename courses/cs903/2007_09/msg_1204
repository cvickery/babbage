  For Assignment 4, one task is to prevent form submission
  when the form has not been filled out properly. In class,
  I think I said that you can prevent form submission by
  having the submit event handler return false, which is
  technically correct, but misleading because you should be
  using event listeners (set up with
  Core.addEventListener()) instead of event handlers (set
  up by assigning a function reference to the form's
  onsubmit property). For event listeners, you prevent form
  submission by calling Core.preventDefault(event) -- which
  handles the fact that IE handles this process differently
  from all other browsers. Note also, that event listeners
  don't need to return a value, and if they do it won't do
  anything.

  As an added feature, input elements (the submit button in
  particular) have a disabled property that you can use to
  prevent the user from trying to click it until all the
  form fields have been verified. But for this assignment, I
  suggest that you leave the submit button enabled and use
  the event listener to decide whether to allow the form to
  be submitted or not.

  Hope this helps,
