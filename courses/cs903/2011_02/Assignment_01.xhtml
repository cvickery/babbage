    Due February 17</h1>
    <div id="content">
      <h2>Reading Assignment</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You have a choice how you learn PHP. You will get only a small fraction of what you need
          from lectures; you will learn a lot simply by writing code and debugging it; and you can
          look everything up on the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/">excellent PHP online
          manual</a>. But having a book that structures the presentation for you can help.
          <p>
            I have not studied all the available books on PHP, but if you would like to have a
            book to guide you, I can recommend David Powers’ <cite>PHP Solutions</cite>, published
            by “Friends of Ed,” available from Amazon for $15.50. Read chapters 1-3 for this
            assignment.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you know, a student in the course has also recommended a JavaScript text from
            Murach’s. They also publish <cite>Murach’s PHP and MySQL</cite> by Joel Murach and Ray
            Harris, which is available for $34.34 in Amazon. Based only on the table of contents, I
            cannot recommend this book for this course because it uses a case history approach, and
            their case history is different from the assignments you will be doing in this course.
            (It’s largely a matter of personal style whether the case history approach works for
            you. It’s a technique primarily intended for self-study, not as a supplement for coursework.) 
            I’m just saying that trying to relate their case history to the assignments in this
            course is likely to be a frustrating endeavor.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if you do decide to try this book, start now with chapters 1-2. (And let me know
            what your experience is.)
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Assignment To Submit</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The assignment is a simple one: make sure your lab account is working correctly; set up a web
          site for the course, and publish your site on babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you have finished the assignment, send me an email message, and I’ll check it out on babbage.
        </p>
          <ul class="standout-block">
            <li>Be sure to sign your email so I know who sent it.</li>
            <li>The Subject line of your message must be: <pre style="margin:0 2em;">CS-90.3 Assignment 1</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
        
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h5>Make sure your lab account is working correctly.</h5>
            <p>
            	Use the information in the <a href="../../TREE_Lab/index.xhtml">TREE Lab Information</a>
              web page to access your account for the course. To test that your roaming profile is working
              correctly, log into one of the lab computers, and create a file someplace, either on your desktop
              or under your <span class="directory-name">My Website</span> directory. Log out of that computer,
              and then log into a <em>different</em> computer. If the file you created on the first computer
              shows up on the second computer, everything is fine. But if it doesn’t, you will have to troubleshoot
              the problem before doing any work for the course. See Dr. Vickery if you have a problem that you cannot
              resolve yourself.
             </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Set up a web site for the course.</h5>
            <p>
              Use Dreamweaver to set up a web site for this course as demonstrated in class and as described in
              the <a href="../../cs081/using_dreamweaver.xhtml">Dreamweaver Setup</a> web page. For now, just set
              up a local site using your <span class="directory-name">My Website</span> directory as the 
              Document Root for your site.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Create three directories in your web site: <span class="directory-name">images</span>, 
              <span class="directory-name">scripts</span>, and <span class="directory-name">css</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Create a stylesheet in the <span class="directory-name">css</span> directory named
              <span class="file-name">assignment_1.css</span>, and add a rule to it that gives a
              color to the background of <span class="tag">body</span> elements. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Create an XHTML5 document named <span class="file-name">index.xhtml</span> that links to your
              stylesheet. Put this code in it:
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
&lt;?php
  header("Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml");
?>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;title>My Web Site&lt;/title>
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/assignment_1.css" />
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    [put something interesting here]
    &lt;a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer">XHTML5&lt;/a>
    &lt;a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer?profile=css3">CSS3&lt;/a>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
            </div>
            <p>
              There are a few things to note about this code:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                It uses PHP to generate an HTTP header at the beginning of the reply message that is
                sent from the server to the browser, something you cannot do using HTML/CSS alone. This
                particular header tells the browser that the document is an XHTML or XML document rather than
                a plain HTML document. In our case, it’s XHTML5. The &lt;?xml declaration tells the browser that
                the document being sent is XML and uses the UTF-8 character set. Make sure Dreamweaver is in sync
                with you
                on this. The lower right corner of your Dreeamweaver editing window has to look something like this:
                <img src="images/assignment_01-1.png" alt="Dreamweaver Screenshot" />
              </li>
              <li>
                There are two links to the W3C validation service at the end of the document’s 
                <span class="tag">body</span> element. They must both be present in all web pages that you
                submit for this course, and clicking on them must generate a report that shows no errors and no
                warnings except for one XHTML5 warning saying that HTML5 validation is experimental.
                <p>But there are exceptions to this rule:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>
                  I’m seeing an error where the CSS3 validator reports syntax errors for the border-radius
                  property. I also see that it’s in their bug-reporting system, so this error is acceptable 
                  until they fix their bug.
                </li>
                <li>
                	It is also all right to use vendor-specific CSS properties, the ones that
                  start with -moz-, -webkit-, etc. even though they will fail to validate. Note, however, that
                  these validation errors might mask real problems in your code that can be hard to track down.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The <span class="attribute-name">type</span> attribute for the <span class="tag">style</span>
                  element is not actually needed for XHTML5 documents, but the CSS3 validator will not find your
                  stylesheet without it, at least for now. When you get your results from the CSS3 validator,
                  be sure to scroll down the page to make sure it actually found your stylesheet(s)!
                </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Be sure your web page shows the background color you set up in your stylesheet, and be sure
                  it validates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you test your web page using an older version of Internet Explorer, you will probably see
                  your code instead of your web page. Use a newer version of IE, or use a different browser.
                </p>
                <p class="standout-block">
                  For those of you new to XHTML and PHP: Web pages that contain PHP code, like this one and
                  all the others you will write for this course, <em>must</em> be delivered by a web server
                  (<em>apache</em>) to avoid passing PHP code to the browser. Browsers understand HTML, CSS,
                  and JavaScript. But not PHP.<br/>
                  This means that to view your web page, you must type the URL into the address bar of your
                  browser, and the URL that you type must start with the name of the computer that is hosting
                  the page.
                  Clicking directly on a file on your computer will bring the page up in your browser, but it
                  won’t go through the web server, and the PHP code will be sent to the browser along with the
                  XHTML &#x2026; and the browser will barf.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h5>Publish your web site on babbage.</h5>
            <p>
              As a new feature of this course, you have been given a “shell account” on 
              babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu (the Macintosh workstation in my office) for the semester. The account name
              and password are the same as for your account in the lab, but the two accounts are independent: if
              your change your password in the lab, it does not change it on babbage, and <em>vice versa</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              One key feature of this setup is that you can set up your Dreamweaver course web site so that it
              uses babbage as your remote server. Submitting assignments becomes a simple matter of just saving
              your work to the remote server and letting me know that it’s ready to be checked out. The truth is,
              you don’t actually have to use Dreamweaver to use this feature, and it’s all right to use different
              tools if you prefer not to use Dreamweaver. But you are on your own if you decide to do that: I’m
              assuming you are using Dreamweaver from the lab.
            </p>
            <p>
            	To illustrate the process of setting up your site, here is the procedure followed by a hypothetical
              colleague of yours named Perfect Student, whose CUNY Id is 99999999.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, our friend Perfect used the Manage Sites panel to set up a local site:
            </p>
            <img src="images/assignment_01-2.png" alt="Screenshot" />
            <p>
              Perfect decided to set the Web URL in the Local Info tab of the site setup panel, but could have
              elected to do it later in the Servers tab. Here is the Local Info tab:
            </p>
            <img src="images/assignment_01-3.png" alt="Screenshot" />
            <p>
              Note that “Case-sensitive links checking” is not checked by default, but that Perfect Student
              (just like you) has dutifully turned it on. Now tht you are on the road to becomming a real
              programmer, you are firmly in the world where proper user of upper and lower case matters. The
              Using Dreamweaver web page includes a section on 
              <a href="../../cs081/using_dreamweaver.xhtml#checking-links">how to use the case-sensitive links
              check feature</a>
              to help track down problems that might show up when you deploy your code to babbage.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next screenshot shows the Servers tab after everything is set up correctly and the Test button
              has been pressed. Unfortunately, you can’t see what’s actually inside the Root Directory: box because
              it is so long. For Perfect Student it is this:
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
/Volumes/Sensitive/Library/WebServer/Documents/babbage.cs.qc.cuny.edu/Grading/903/stpe9999
            </div>
            <img src="images/assignment_01-4.png" alt="Screenshot" />
            <p>
              You will have to replace <span class="code-snippet">stpe9999</span> with your own account name.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, here is a view of Perfect Student’s site in Dreamweaver with Assignment 1 for the course
              finished:
            </p>
            <img src="images/assignment_01-5.png" alt="Screenshot" />
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="standout-block">Note: you can always see larger versions of screenshots used in this course by 
      right clicking on them and displaying them in a new tab or browser window.
