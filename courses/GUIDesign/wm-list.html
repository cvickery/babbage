<h1 align=center>Window Managers</h1>
With apologies to the FAQ list from which I copied it (I can't locate
the list again), here is a list of window managers available for the X
Window System.<P>

The window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the
X window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there
is no single window manager; instead, there are many, which support
different ways for the user to interact with windows and different
styles of window layout, decoration, and keyboard and colormap focus.
In approximate chronological order (generally, the more recent ones
conformant more with the ICCCM and are the only ones being maintained):

<UL>

<LI><b> wm:</b> this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in
R2 or R3.<p>

<LI><b> uwm:</b> the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its
speed, although it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4
tape.<p>

<LI><b> twm (old):</b> Tom's Window Manager was among the first
non-Consortium window managers and offered the user a great deal of
customization options in a re-parenting window manager.<p>

<LI><b> awm:</b> the Ardent Window Manager was for a while a hotbed for
hackers and offered some features (dynamic menus) not found on more
current window managers.<p>

<LI><b> rtl:</b> Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they
don't overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred
size.<p>

<LI><b> dxwm:</b> Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering.<p>

<LI><b> hpwm:</b> HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a
precursor of mwm.<p>

<LI><b> mwm:</b> the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif
toolkit.<p>

<LI><b> tekwm:</b> Tektronix's window manager offering.<p>

<LI><b> olwm (Sun):</b> olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of
the Style Guide functionality.<p>

<LI><b> olwm (AT&T):</b> ditto<p>

<LI><b> gwm:</b> Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a
built-in Lisp interpreter. Version 1.8 is in koala.inria.fr:/pub/gwm/
and on ftp.x.org [7/95]<p>

<LI><b> m_swm:</b> the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape<p>

<LI><b> pswm:</b> Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the
OpenWindows release.<p>

<LI><b> swm:</b> Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers
multiple GUI support and also a panning virtual window; configuration
information comes from the resources file. Sources are on ftp.x.org in
R5contrib/swm.tar.Z; they require OI binaries.<p>

<LI><b> twm (new):</b> the new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a
reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the
one on later X releases.<p>

<LI><b> vtwm:</b> vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of
swm, with a single-root window implementation.  A new version,
vtwm-5.3, is based on the R5 twm and is available from ftp.x.org.
[1/94]<p>

<LI><b> tvtwm:</b> Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on
the Tab Window Manager and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the
virtual-root window of swm. It is available on ftp.x.org and mirroring
archive servers. The current [3/95] version is available at
ftp.x.org:/contrib/window_managers/tvtwm.pl11.tar.gz.<p>

<LI><b> olvwm:</b> the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm.
It is available on archive servers; version 4.1 [2/94] is on
ftp.x.org.<p>

<LI><b> mvwm:</b> the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A
beta version is floating around (most recently from
suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a source license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3
[3/92].<p>

<LI><b> NCDwm:</b> the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an
mwm look.<p>

<LI><b> XDSwm:</b> the window manager local to Visual Technology's
terminals is simple but full-featured.<p>

modification of the R5 twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of
HP vuewm and also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.
Version 3.3 [9/95] source is on ftp.x.org and possibly also
sunsite.unc.edu.<p>

michaela@x.co.uk or laurie@ixi.com.<p>

<LI><b> fvwm:</b> this virtual window manager has been rewritten from
scratch and is very light on system resources (between half and
two-thirds the memory usage of twm, on which it was based). fvwm offers
most of the features others provide, plus additional features. Source
is available from sunsite.unc.edu in /pub/Linux/X11/window-managers/;
fvwm-1.24r-source.tar.z was current in 1/95; 2.1.0 is expected early
1996. Information:

ftp://ftp.hpc.uh.edu/pub/fvwm/version-2/ .<p>

<LI><b> mwm 2.0:</b> the 2.0 version of mwm includes support for
multiple workspaces.<p>

<LI><b> 9wm:</b> by David Hogan (dhog@cs.su.oz.au), is an X window
manager which attempts to emulate the Plan 9 window manager 8-1/2 as
far as possible within the constraints imposed by X.  The latest
version of 9wm is held at ftp://ftp.cs.su.oz.au/dhog/9wm .<p>

<LI><b> mwfm:</b> MWFM is a Microsoft-Windows-Program-Manager-style
applications manager.  It offers Unix users the ability to work in a
MS-Windows-like environment.  Sources are at

(pub/comp/X11/contrib/clients/vr/vr-1.01.tar.Z); Vr is a workspace
manager intended to be window-manager-independent.<p>
