</center>

The UWIN directory contains subdirectories for Versions 1.51 and
a beta version of 2.0.  I use the beta version of 2.0 myself, but
I used version 1.51 for a long time without problems.  Both of these
directories have readme files and some executables.  Run the "base"
executable to install the, uh, base part of the system.  This will give
you ksh and lots of UNIX commands, but you won't be able to use any C
compiler from the ksh prompt.<p>

Running the "development" file will install lots of header files needed
to use a C compiler from the command line.  If you have Visual C++
installed on your system, you will be able to use it to compile
programs using the traditional UNIX "cc" command.  But even if you don't
have Visual C++, you can use the files in the ecgs directory to install
the GNU development tools (gcc, gdb, etc.).<p>

The other directory, su_UNIX_v2, contains documentation for the X/Open
Group's Single UNIX Specification, to which U/WIN adheres.<p>
