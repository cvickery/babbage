<H2>Deliverables and Due Date</H2>

Put all source files for this project in a tar file, and email the zip
file to me by midnight of the date of the final exam, <B>May 20</B>.<p>

Be sure to put your name and ID number in the body of your email
message.  Also tell me any optional parts of the assignment that you
have completed in your email message.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

At this point, you have code which parses command lines into individual
commands.  You have also written code that uses a dispatch table to
process built-in commands.  The remainder of the project is to build
a complete shell, building on your existing code.  The Development Steps
outlined below will lead you through this process.

<H2>Development Steps</H2>

<ol compact>
  
  <LI><B>Parse Individual Commands.</B>  Use your <I>strtok()</I> from
  Assignment 2 to tokenize individual commands.  Tokens are separated
  by space, tab, &lt;, and &gt; characters.  Print out each token for
  each command to verify that this step works correctly.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B> Recognize <I>all</I> I/O redirection operators as
  separate tokens.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B> (<I>hard</I>) Treat quoted strings as single
  tokens.  This can include single quotes and backslashes as well as
  double quotes.<p>

  <LI><B>Build Argument List.</B>  Before determining whether a command
  is built-in or external, construct an argument list for the command
  based on the tokens entered by the user.  You may impose a limit of
  10 on the number of command line arguments a user may enter, but in
  this case, if there are more than 10, you must issue a warning
  message saying that additional arguments are being ignored.  Do not
  include I/O redirection symbols or their arguments in the list of
  command-line arguments.<p>

  <B>Optional:</B>  Use <I>malloc()</I> to allocate memory for the
  pointers in the argument list dynamically instead of putting a fixed
  limit on the number of allowed arguments.  Don't forget to free
  (<I>free()</I>) each list.<p>
  
  <B>Optional:</B>  Put all the information about each command,
  including I/O redirection information. into a <CODE>struct</CODE>
  like this one:

<pre>
    struct cmd_info {
      char   *cmd_name;
      char   *argv[10];
      char   *stdin[2];
      char   *stdout[2];
      char   *stderr[2];
      char  **envp;
      };
</pre>

  Whether you build the complete structure or just the argument list, be
  sure it is correct either by printing it out or by examining it using
  <I>gdb</I>.<p>

  <LI><B>Process Built-in Commands.</B>  Use the dispatch table
  developed [&nbsp;<a HREF="qshell.html">earlier</A>&nbsp;] to process
  the first token in each command.  Modify the prototype for built-in
  commands to match the one for <I>main()</I>.  When you have this
  working, you should be able to enter the following command line: "ls;
  exit; date" and the program should report that ls is not a built-in
  command, then exit.<p>

  <LI><B>Recognize External Commands.</B>  If a command name is not in
  your list of built-in commands, look for it in each directory listed
  in the PATH environment variable.  If found, print the complete
  pathname of the file.  If not found, print an error message
  indicating that the file cannot be found.<p>  

  <LI><B>Execute External Commands.</B>  Fork a process to execute each
  external command, and execute it.  If the command exits with a
  non-zero exit code, print its value.<p>

  <LI><B>Set Shell Variables.</B>  PS1 and PATH should have immediate
  visible effects, but all variables should be saved.  Modify the
  environment passed to a command based on the settings of these
  variables.<p>
  
  <LI><B>Set.</B>  Implement the <I>set</I> built-in command.

  <LI><B>Aliases.</B>  Implement the <I>alias</I> built-in command.
  
  <LI><B>Variable Substitution.</B>  For each reference to a shell
  variable in a command line, substitute the value of the corresponding
  shell variable before tokenizing the command.<p>
  
  <LI><B>Pattern Substitution.</B>  It should be obvious to you how to
  do this.<p>

  <LI><B>Control Structures.</B>  Implement <I>case</I>, <I>if</I>, and
  <I>for</I>.  For full credit, you need to extend your shell to
  implement at least one control structure not already available in the
  <I>KornShell.</I>
