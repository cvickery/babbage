<H2>Due Date and Deliverables</H2>

This assignment is due by <B>midnight, February 16</B>.<p>

You are to submit three files, consisting of one KornShell script
and two C source files.  Send them as <I>attachments</I> to an email
message.  The contents are described below.

<H2>The Shell Script</H2>

Write a shell script named printargs that prints four lines.  The first
line tells the name that was used to invoke the script, the second line
tells how many parameters there were, the third line tells what the
last parameter was, and the fourth line tells what the first parameter
was.<p>

For example:

<PRE>
    <B>$ </B>printargs a b c
    <B>My name is printargs.
    There were 3 parameters.
    The last one was c.
    The first one was a.
    $ </B>
</PRE>

You may use the <I>shift</I> command, but you are not to use any loops.
Read about the <I>shift</I> command in Chapter 5, and look it up in
Appendix B.

<H2>The C Program</H2>

The first source file is to be named printargs.c, and is to
<CODE>#include</CODE> a header file named do_print.h.  It is to contain
a definition of the method <I>main()</I>, which is to receive the
standard three arguments.  <I>main()</I> is to pass the first two
arguments to a function named <I>do_print()</I>, and then it is to
print each of the environment variables, one per line.<p>

The second source file is to be named do_print.c.  It must also
<CODE>#include</CODE> do_print.h, and is to contain the definition of
<I>do_print()</I>, which is to print each of the command line arguments
in reverse order before it returns.<p>

For example:

<PRE>
    <B>$ </B>gcc -g -Wall printargs.c do_print.c -o printargs
    <B>$ </B>./printargs you? are How there. Hello,
    <B>The command line arguments are: Hello, there. How are you? ./printargs

</PRE>

<H2>Document Your Code</H2>

There are few formal rules for documenting your KornShell programs this
semester.  Just be sure to put the name of the file and your name in the
first few lines, and use comments elsewhere to indicate logical sections
of the code.<p>

For C programs, you are to follow the [&nbsp;<a
