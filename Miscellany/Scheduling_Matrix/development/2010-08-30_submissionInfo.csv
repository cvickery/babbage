Our current system has caused some confusionamong both nonmajors and majors, and the renumbering should eliminate that.  Wealso are slightly modifying the course description of the current 140W, whichspecifies ""a wide variety of English and American poetry.""  In 165W we leaveout ""English and American"" to give instructors freedom to use Anglophone globalpoems, which are becoming increasingly important in the field.                              Thedescriptionalso eliminates ""Designed for prospective English majors.""

Cultural anthropology addresses and attempts to explicatecultural, social, religious, economic, political and other characteristics andsystems of societies from various parts of the world.  In other words,anthropology is, at base, a discipline concerned with what it is to be humanand students are expected to develop the ability to examine social phenomenafrom a cross-cultural point of view while developing critical perspectives ontheir own culture(s). Over the course of the semester we therefore concentrateon theory and methods related to approaches to human unity and diversity, withsome attention to language as developed in linguistic anthropology. Readingstypically include three to four ethnographies, (an ethnography is a writtendescription and often analysis of a community, institution, or group of peoplein which data is obtained through firsthand field research).  Some instructorsalso include a coursepack which contains articles and primary source documents.As becomes apparent to students as a result of the diversity of ethnographiesread, anthropology is a diverse field concerned with values, social structures,attempts to find meaning in a complex universe, and, especially, with humanvariability across space and time. Lectures and readings are intended to helpstudents become aware that anthropology is not simply the study of primitive,simple, or marginal peoples but rather a way of seeing, being in, andrepresenting a world constantly in transition even it may also be united bycertain shared traits and experiences.

In1973, Theodore Dobzhansky, one of the most influential figures in evolutionarybiology, wrote ""Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light ofevolution."" This course pursues an integrative approach to the study of humanevolution. Situating humans within the animal kingdom as members of the PrimateOrder, students are introduced to evolution from multiple perspectives:molecular genetics, population genetics, and the fossil record; on multiplelevels, including molecular, organismic, population, species, and higher ordertaxonomic units. This class also relates the theory of evolution to otherfields of scientific inquiry: biological systematics, ethology, morphology,biomechanics, and geology. The course is designed to achieve PLAS goals as follows:1. To demonstrate how biological anthropology and evolutionary biology createknowledge and understanding, this course introduces the students to thescientific method and its role in developing our understandings of howevolution has shaped our species and produced biological variation among modernhumans. This course aims to make students aware of the investigative roles ofobservation, construction and testing of research hypotheses, experimentaldesign, and data analysis.2. To position biological anthropology and evolutionary biology within theliberal arts and the larger society, using human evolution as a central theme.Liberal arts refer to a college or university curriculum aimed at impartinggeneral knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities in contrast toa professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. This course illustrateshow core biological concepts relate to our understanding of the origins of ourspecies, as well as exposing the connections between humans and non-humanprimates. Throughout the course there will be an emphasis on the ways in whichscientists learn about human evolution and the significance of human evolutionfor understanding humans today.3. To introduce students to a body of knowledge at the core of the naturalsciences: the biological basis of life, the basics of cell biology andmolecular genetics, Mendelian genetics, population genetics, systematics,molecular phylogeny, cladistic analysis, behavioral studies, biomechanics, andanalysis of the fossil record. 4. To enhance quantitative reasoning among students through assignments thatemploy quantitative exercises in the context of evolutionary theory.5. To introduce students to the primary sources of literature on humanevolution and other primary materials such as the skeletons of non-humanprimates and replicas of fossils related to human evolution.6. To reveal the existence and importance of change through time, the naturalprocesses that result in biological change across the generations are theprimary focus of this course. The course discusses how natural selection,mutations, gene flow, and genetic drift result in biological change over time.The course also examines the fossil record as a direct source of evidence ofbiological change.7. To illuminate diversity, as well as the nature and construction of forms ofdifference, this course considers how the forces of evolution have shapedbiological variation in modern humans and examines how environmental variationaround the world, as well as the distribution of pathogens, has affectedstature and body proportions, pigmentation, and the distribution of otherheritable traits in different human populations.",17 Sep 2008 15:40:52 GMT,Not Applicable,3,None,Existing,Anthropology 102,Every Semester,,8-May-10,45-120,Natural Science (NS),Not Applicable,Sara,Stinson,sara.stinson@qc.cuny.edu,Anthropology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sara,Stinson,,,,,sara.stinson@qc.cuny.edu,,,,,10,10X-A3F6J0J8D0,ANTH 103: Introduction to Archaeology,John Collins,2-Apr-08,"Catalogue Description: A survey of human prehistory and the methods used byarchaeologists to examine and interpret the past.

Thiscourse and its companion, Global Literatures I, aim to provide students with agreater awareness of the global cultural contexts in which literary works arecreated (which is intended to enhance rather than diminish consideration of theaesthetic qualities of these texts).

One of the major struggles that shaped what weknow as the ""modern world"" involved a conflict between the people and ideasthat constituted the colonial project - the occupation, expropriation, andforced exploitation by European (and later United States) capitalism of entirepeoples and regions of the globe in the name of ""civilization"" and ""economicdevelopment"" - and those who were subjected to this regime of control.                    For alltheir failings in certain regards, anti-colonial struggles, which intensifiedduring the post-World War II era in Africa and Asia, did succeed in changingthe map and the way we look at the world now.  Some say that we are now in apostcolonial order, and others that colonialism is still very much with us innew forms.  In order to make sense of these debates, and the present globalmoment as a whole, it is useful to examine the literature that came out ofcolonialism and the resistance to it.  Beginning with the Martiniquan poet AiméCésaire's violent denunciation of the racism and dehumanization integral to thetheory and practice of colonialism, this course juxtaposes representative (andfrequently critical) literary writings by carriers of the colonial project withworks by those brought up under colonialism and prepared to use its own weapons(including literary ones) to undermine and destroy it.                                    Readingsaredrawn fromthe Caribbean, South Asia, Central and Eastern Africa, and the Maghreb (NorthAfrica).",17 Sep 2008 15:48:56 GMT,Not Applicable,3,English 110,Existing,Comparative Literature 102W,Every Semester,,10-Jun-10,25,Reading Literature (RL),World Cultures (WC),Christopher,Winks,christopher.winks@qc.cuny.edu,Comparative Literature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Christopher,Winks,,,,,christopher.winks@qc.cuny.edu21,21X-C4A4J0G4I2,CMLIT 101W: Global Literatures I,Christopher Winks,3-Sep-08,"Among the distinctive contributions of the always open and diversified field ofComparative Literature to a liberal education has been its emphasis on what hasbeen called the ""worlding"" of literature, the various ways in which literaturehelps us to see and understand the world we live in and its multiple pasts,presents, and futures, and on the importance of textual analysis andtranslation as communicating vessels between languages and cultures.

At its most general, the subfield introduces students to theseconcepts through comparative analysis whereby their own ""orientalism"" isdestabilized by looking at the differences among political systems inhistorical, cultural and political contexts; hence, the term ""comparative."" Traditional approaches to the area emphasize the influence of players fromthree levels of analysis:  historical (economic modernization and politicaldevelopment), cultural (political cultures and socialization), and structural(party systems, government institutions).  Faculty trained in CP specialize inparticular geographic areas (e.g., the Middle East, Latin America, Asia) andthus all courses are, by definition, comparative and concerned with worldcultures. The attached sample syllabus emphasizes the theoretical elements ofCP and apply these to the study of countries across three worlds: earlydevelopers, late developers and developing countries (the Global North, GlobalEast and Global South).  Other faculty in the Political Science Department relyon the same theories and concepts, but may apply them to different regions ofthe globe.

What do we learn about ""the veryage and body of the time"" by reading plays, learning about theatrical practicesand enacting scenes?        This course connects dramatic literature from various time periods withthe culture and beliefs of people who lived during those times.        Students will spend seven weeks reading and analyzing plays written byChristopher Marlowe and several early plays of William Shakespeare.  We willcompare Shakespeare's Richard II to Marlowe's Edward II; Shakespeare's RichardIII to Marlowe's Dr. Faustus; Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice to Marlowe's TheJew of Malta and Shakespeare's violent Titus Andronicus        The second half of the semester will familiarize the students withElizabethan society and the issues facing the playwrights who wrote during thatera.  Using the Reacting to the Past pedagogy in a role-play situation designedby Professor Eric Mallin, ( Marlowe and Shakespeare, 1592), the class will bedivided into three groups: The Lord Strange's Men (led by Richard Burbage), TheLord Admiral's Men (led by Edward Alleyn), and Queen Elizabeth's Privy Council(historical figures who advise Her Majesty).  Each student will research andassume the role of a specific figure of the time.   We will set up a contestbetween the two troupes, who, by means of oral and written arguments gleanedfrom a variety of primary and secondary documents, as well as  performances,attempt to persuade the Privy Council to select either The Jew of Malta orTitus Andronicus to be produced at Henslowe's Rose Theatre in 1592.          Role-play is a theatrical technique used by many disciplines in orderto allow students to ""walk a mile in the moccasins"" of another being.  In theirRenaissance roles, students will experience firsthand the dangerous politicalatmosphere of the time, the difficulties faced by the playwrights in skirtingthe censors, and  the reception their work was given by ordinary people as wellas those in authority.                    They will learn about the class system andfindtheplace of their characters within it.   Twenty-first century actors will learnhow unimportant they become in a society ruled by a powerful monarch, one inwhich they need the protection of members of the nobility to survive in theirlowly profession.  Through their reading of primary documents (such as letters,royal proclamations, playbills, handbooks, treatises), students will compareand contrast life in the Renaissance with their contemporary points of view.  They will need to filter their way of thinking through the lens of the EnglishRenaissance.   In 1592 London, how does one survive and achieve success in aprofession, in the family, in marriage, in church, in society?                    Howhavethesegoals changed today both in our country and abroad?Possible Course Variations:a) In the fall of 08, I will be teaching this variant: in the first half of thesemester students read and analyze the following Greek plays (The Orestaia byAeschylus, Antigone by Sophocles, Medea by Euripides, and Lysistrata and TheClouds by Aristophanes).  Students will come to understand the society duringwhich these playwrights plied their trade, through dramatic  literature and thestudy of historical texts. The second half will involve the students in arole-playing situation designed by Professor Mark Carnes and Josiah Ober:  TheThreshold of Democracy: Athens in 403 B.C.  After reading Plato's Republic andother historical documents, students will re-enact the trial of Socrates andreflect on the value of democracy in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian Wars. b) In the fall of 07, I taught this variant: in the first half of the semesterstudents read and analyzed plays of the French Classical Theatre, leading up tothe French Revolution: (Racine's Phaedra, Corneille's Le Cid,  Moliere's TheIntellectual Ladies, Marivaux's The Game of Love and Chance and Beaumarchais'sThe Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro).

Not only islinguistic behavior the central focus of many social settings, but it is alsoon linguistic evidence that we base many of our evaluations of the world aroundus. Yet attitudes towards language and the ways in which we use language arehighly dependent on social and cultural factors.

It provides studentswith a history of the development of linguistic anthropology, its theoreticaland methodological issues, and case studies that illustrate the understandingsof language in sociocultural contexts and how linguists and anthropologistsengage real world issues. It aims to address commonly held misconceptions aboutlanguage as well as important issues such as appreciation of diversity,multiculturalism, language policies, ethics and social justice.  Discussions onthe sociocultural significance of language will be held by addressing suchquestions as:  To what extent does language shape our thoughts and identities? What does it mean to know a language?  Can we think without language?  Do allchildren follow the same language acquisition patterns within a society oracross cultures?  What is the nature of sign language?

In thefirst part of the course we focus mainly upon the U.S. experience ofblacks/whites because this experience has been so central to U.S. developmentand because the black/white social structure has been a model for how racismwas applied to other non-white and inferior white races in the U.S.  Our focus on race develops a sociological and historical analysis of race as asocial structural relationship that entails social practices and ideology.  Webegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, andcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticismof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as asocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history. Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,the development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how thesocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meaningsin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, theactions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and thesocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                     We compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews andItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20thcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become ""white"" ethic groups. Finally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racismsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, thehousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,including white race projects and white privilege.  Our goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race issocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race andbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  The second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as achanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups withsurrounding social institutions.  Assimilation/ resistance to assimilation isour central problematic.   We examine aspects of the immigration and ethnicdevelopment of the late 19th and early 20th century and the sociological theoryused to account for ethnicity and assimilation.  We examine a new sociologicaltheory of assimilation that incorporates and revises the older sociologicaltheory and is primarily a response to the ""new"" immigrations that begin around1970.                   We compare the social conditions faced by the descendants ofearly andnew immigrants as well as how their ideas and values changed and are changing.    We compare the experience of the second generation of three different ""new""ethnic groups and how their assimilation rates are  affected by the diversesocial, human and financial capital of their immigrant parents, U.S. laws andpolitical institutions, and U.S. capitalism in the light of a globalizedeconomy, the ease of international transportation and communication, and theirnon-whiteness.                    Our goal is to enable students to reflect upon the changing nature of ethnicityand why groups assimilate at different rates, the changing nature of theory inrelation to new experience, and, given the ethnic diversity of QC, we want toprovide students with some tools to reflect upon their own experience.",3 Nov 2008 21:22:34 GMT,Not Applicable,3,Sociology 101 or Anthropology 101,Existing,Sociology 211,Every Semester,,3,35,Analyzing Social Structures (SS),United States (US),Martin,Eisenberg,strickmcaul@msn.com,Sociology,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mr.,Martin,Eisenberg,,,,,strickmcaul@msn.com79,79X-I0A8J3G5I3,PHYS 122: General Physics II,Vinod Menon,14-Oct-08,"This course is the second semester of the algebra based introductory physicscourse, where new fundamental concepts of classical physics are introduced anddiscussed.

The idea of unity of nature emerged as a mainscientific theme of last two centuries as a result of unification ofelectricity and magnetism into electrodynamics, and reducing optics toelectromagnetism. Also, given the fact that no other scientific disciplineinfluenced culture and technology more than electrodynamics (think electricityand electronics), the proposed course will help students to understand howscientific ideas can shape modern society. The course also introduces thestudents to some of the modern physics concepts such as special relativity andthe wave particle duality of matter.        Interaction between students and teaching staff is organized in theform of three components: lectures, recitations and labs.  Students learnmaterial, however, not only during scheduled class times, but also during theirpreparation for classes. The preparation includes: reading a textbook andadditional reading materials, solving homework problems, performing otherassignments such as preparing talks, writing blogs, etc. as deemed necessary byan instructor.Main goal of lectures is to deliver the main conceptual content of the studiedmaterial. Organization of lectures depends on individual styles of professorsteaching the course, but active involvement of students in discussion of thesubject matter will always be one of the main means of achieving this goal.Recitations play a more technical role: during recitations students sharpentheir practical skill in applying new concepts to typical situations occurringin real life or during scientific inquiry. During labs, students are introducedto and obtain hands-on experience of empirical methods of scientific inquiry.They learn to design meaningful scientific experiments, use basic measuringdevices and instruments, collect and analyze experimental data to makereasonable scientific inferences.         Topics in this class include: Waves and SoundElectrostatics: Electric charges and their interaction, Coulomb law, Gauss'slaw, electric field, electrostatic potential, potential energy of systems ofcharges, capacitors and their applications     Direct electric current: Electric current, resistance and resistivity, Ohm'slaw, Kirchhoff's rulesMagnetostatics: Magnetic field and magnetic force on charges and currents, theBiot-Savart and Ampere's lawsElectromagnetic phenomena: magnetic induction and Faraday's law, Lenz's law,magnetic energy, alternating-current circuits, and electromagnetic wavesOptics: geometric optics and optical instruments, light as electromagneticwave, polarization, dispersion, diffraction and interferenceModern Physics: Special theory of relativity, nature of atom and wave-particleduality of matter.",12 Oct 2008 17:12:35 GMT,Abstract or Quantitative Reasoning (QR),4,"Physics 121, Algebra and Trigonometry",Existing,Phys 122,Every Semester,,4,24,Natural Science Lab (NS-L),Not Applicable,Vinod,Menon,vmenon@qc.cuny.edu,Physics,,,,,,,,,,,,,Prof.,Vinod,Menon,,,,,vmenon@qc.cuny.edu80,80X-E8F9G5D5F5,SOC 222 OLD: Social Welfare as a Social Institution,Suzanne Strickland,Old,"Crafting sound social welfare policy in a democracy is a complex task thatrequires policy-makers to ask hard questions.                  How does socialwelfarepolicyshape the character of a citizen?  Can social welfare policy effectivelypromote equality?  What constitutes good social policy; does empirical evidenceprove the efficacy of policy approaches, or are there broader theoreticalquestions that define effectiveness?  To answer these questions, this coursetraces the philosophical, economic, political and historic tributaries thatshaped the United States' social welfare system.  Students will gain anunderstanding of the interplay of these factors, and how the contours ofcontemporary social policy continue to illustrate this complex weave ofphilosophical, economic, political and historic events.    The first large-scale challenge to social welfare policy occurred with theimmigration of 1845.  We will examine the settlement house movement in Chicagoby reading Jane Adams's book, The Spirit of Youth and The City Streets.  Classreading will also focus on Jacob Riis's parallel account of New York City'simmigrant experience.  The class will define the evolution of government's role in social welfare byfocusing first on Al Smith's important influence as a ward boss from the LowerEast Side of New York City, to the governorship of New York, and finally to thenational stage as a candidate for the presidency.  Then we will discuss thecritical impact of Franklin Roosevelt's policies as governor of New York andlater as president.  These policies had a far reaching impact in building afederal role for social welfare.   Examining Post-WW II America, the class will analyze how government policies ofthe late 1940's and 1950's contributed to prosperity for many Americans, but atthe same time, as Michael Harrington posited, these strategies created serious""social deficits"" for southern blacks, displaced industrial workers and theelderly.  The Great Society sought to redress these ""social deficits,"" butseveral theorists argued that the strategies developed to ameliorate theproblems did not achieve that goal. We will examine the empirical evidence usedto evaluate these programs to discern what some of the failures were.  Thisexamination formed the basis for the welfare reform overall of 1994. The last part of the course will define the current social welfare challengesposed in the 21st Century.",3 Nov 2008 21:24:21 GMT,Not Applicable,3,None,Existing,Sociology 222,Every Semester,,2,35,Culture and Values (CV),United States (US),Suzanne,Strickland,strickmcaul@msn.com,Sociology,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ms.,Suzanne,Strickland,,,,,strickmcaul@msn.com81,81X-D4A0B1C4C8,SOC 215 OLD: Sociology of Education,Kristine Rosales,Old,"An examination of the broad social, economic, and political characteristics ofeducational institutions, policies and practices and their ramifications.

Selections will include such comparisons as Richard IIand Marlowe’s Edward II; Shakespeare’s Richard III and Marlowe’s Dr.Faustus; Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice and Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta,and Shakespeare’s violent Titus Andronicus.

Electrochemical concepts areexplored with a view to understanding the nature of energy generation, storageand retrieval, and the centrality of these same processes to cellular energyprocessing and signaling. The structure of molecules comprises the basis for all modern theories ofmaterials, and a comprehensive elementary treatment of both electronic andgeometric molecular structure is provided.

This first laboratory course inchemistry, therefore, is designed to give students a set of fundamentallaboratory techniques which will lay a foundation for study in all of thesciences, as well as in advanced chemistry.Quantitative and abstract reasoning are emphasized throughout, beginning with acomprehensive requirement for mastery of the analysis of dimensions and units,the precision of scientific data, and error analysis during the firstlaboratory period.  Starting from the fundamental physical principle of theconservation of energy and mass, chemical transformations are investigated withan emphasis on quantitative precision (Laboratories 5, 6, 7 and 11) andqualitative completeness (Laboratories 3 - 5, 9).  A complete treatment of themeasure of the elements - or stoichiometry - in Laboratories 5 and 6 providesthe basic tools for balancing chemical reactions and solving quantitativeproblems stemming from these reactions.  As a result, students learn to predictwhat chemical species can be created from specific reactants, both inqualitative (Laboratory 6) and quantitative (Laboratory 11) terms.The energetics of chemical change are contrasted to measures of spontaneity. Chemical transformations are thereby classified as being either spontaneous ornonspontaneous, and the implications of spontaneity are explored from the pointof view of intrinsic energy availability in Laboratories 5 and 6.

It examines acting, playwriting, design and production, directing, theuse of dramatic literature in performance, and scholarly aspects includingcriticism and history. Students will be guided to develop an appreciation ofthe many collaborative elements essential in the creation, production, andcriticism of theatrical events.         The field of theatre requires knowledge of antecedent theatricalpractices to understand form and practice of a play within its original cultureand to provide a basis for re-crafting it for a contemporary audience.Therefore students will be introduced to historical practices of dramaturgy,staging, and assessment of aesthetics.        Theatre is based in the knowledge and skill of crafting form.Therefore, a variety of techniques (acting exercises, shop experience intheatrical building of sets and costumes, project assignments of stagingscenes, etc) will be introduced to guide in understanding and appreciating thedevelopment of presentational form.        The processes of crafting and analyzing performance require a criticalunderstanding of the relationship between the performer and the audience.Students will learn that theatrical techniques can teach us about differentcultures and different time periods as they develop a critical approach towardsthe viewing of theatrical events.Course Objectives:Upon completion of DRTH 001, students should accomplish the followingobjectives to: 1.            Achieve a basic understanding of theatrical performance and itsposition as a synthesis of many arts_playwriting, acting, directing, design,music, and dance_leading to a better understanding, interpretation, andevaluation of creative works. 2.            Engage in critical and useful participation in theatre, as either athinking member of the audience, or as a participant in the art itself bothduring the course and after its completion.3.            Develop aesthetic sensibilities that expand understanding ofartisticform.4.            Recognize the benefits and possibilities for continued culturalengagement throughout life through exposure to the theatrical arts in thiscourse's classroom activities and through participation as an audience memberin live theatre. 5.            Improve communication skills through viewing, thinking, talking,andwriting critically about theatrical events. 6.            Increase sensitivity to the values of others through exposure todiverse opinions in both reading dramatic literature and watching plays, and inclass discussions on those issues.7.            Develop skills in problem solving through analysis of, discussionsabout, and participation in group projects on theatrical texts andperformances. 8.            Develop skills to cooperatively work in groups through efforts ingroupprojects and discussions, and participation in the social and collaborativeexperience of live theatre. 9.

In thefirst part of the course we focus mainly upon the U.S. experience ofblacks/whites because this experience has been so central to U.S. developmentand because the black/white social structure has been a model for how racismwas applied to other non-white and inferior white races in the U.S.  Our focus on race develops a sociological and historical analysis of race as asocial structural relationship that entails social practices and ideology.  Webegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, andcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticismof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as asocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history. Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,the development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how thesocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meaningsin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, theactions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and thesocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                                We compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews andItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20thcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become ""white"" ethic groups. Finally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racismsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, thehousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,including white race projects and white privilege.  Our goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race issocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race andbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  The second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as achanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups withsurrounding social institutions.  Assimilation/ resistance to assimilation isour central problematic.   We examine aspects of the immigration and ethnicdevelopment of the late 19th and early 20th century and the sociological theoryused to account for ethnicity and assimilation.  We examine a new sociologicaltheory of assimilation that incorporates and revises the older sociologicaltheory and is primarily a response to the ""new"" immigrations that begin around1970.

By the mid 1800's,successive waves of immigrants from Europe begin to come to America, and thisinflux challenges the European legal framework. America begins to understandthe immigrant experience_and its implication for democracy_through the eclecticcontributions made by social reformers, journalists, scientists, and the influxinto America of prominent European thinkers, who begin to modify their Europeanperspectives by the American experience.  These forces shape American socialwelfare institutions created in the 19th Century that begin to mediate betweenthe harshness of capitalism and the rights of man. In the 20th Century, as America emerges as the leader of the free world, socialwelfare institutions are again reshaped by economic and political changes inthe world and in the country._____________________________________________________________________  Crafting social welfare policy in a democracy is a complex task that requirespolicy-makers to ask hard questions.   How does social welfare policy shape thecharacter of a citizen?  Can social welfare policy effectively promoteequality?  What constitutes good social policy; does empirical evidence provethe efficacy of policy approaches, or are there broader theoretical questionsthat define effectiveness?  To answer these questions, this course traces thephilosophical, economic, political and historic tributaries that shaped theUnited States' social welfare system.  Students will gain an understanding ofthe interplay of these factors, and how the contours of contemporary socialpolicy continue to illustrate this complex weave of philosophical, economic,political and historic events.                The first large-scale challenge to social welfare policy in America occurredwith the immigration of 1845.  Beyond the significance of integrating largewaves of immigrants, the Chicago experience begins to shape an indigenousAmerican Sociology.  We will examine the settlement house movement in Chicagoand its significance to American social science by reading Jane Adams's book,The Spirit of Youth and The City Streets.  Class reading will also focus onJacob Riis's parallel account of New York City's immigrant experience.              The class will define the evolution of government's role in social welfare byfocusing first on Al Smith's important influence as a ward boss from the LowerEast Side of New York City, to the governorship of New York, and finally to thenational stage as a candidate for the presidency.  Then we will discuss thecritical impact of Franklin Roosevelt's policies as governor of New York andlater as president.  These policies had a far reaching impact in building afederal role for social welfare.   Examining Post-WW II America, the class will analyze how government policies ofthe late 1940's and 1950's contributed to prosperity for many Americans, but atthe same time, as Michael Harrington posited, these strategies created serious""social deficits"" for southern blacks, displaced industrial workers and theelderly.  The Other America, by Michael Harrington explains why America neededto fight The War on Poverty to help those at risk.  The Great Society sought toredress these ""social deficits,"" but several theorists argued that thestrategies developed to ameliorate the problems did not achieve that goal. Wewill examine the empirical evidence used to evaluate these programs to discernwhat some of the failures were.  Losing Ground by Charles Murray provides aprovocative explanation for this failure. This examination formed the basis forthe welfare reform overall of 1994. The last part of the course will define the current social welfare challengesposed in the 21st Century.",17 Feb 2009 21:09:34 GMT,Not Applicable,3,Pre-requisites include Soc 101 or Anth 101 or Econ 101 or Fnes 106 or Hss1 or Psci 100 or Psci 101 or Urbst 101.,Existing,Soc 222,Every Semester,,1,45,Culture and Values (CV),United States (US),Suzanne,Strickland,strickmcaul@msn.com,Sociology,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ms.,Suzanne,Strickland,,,,,strickmcaul@msn.com117,117X-D7I9F2I8C0,BIOL 024: Biology and Society,"Karl Fath, Corinne Michels and PoKay Ma",4-Mar-09,"Biology and Society is a non major lecture course focusing on selectedbiological principles in genetics, development, evolution, physiology, andecology that are discussed in context of their impact on various aspects ofhuman society.

With respect to the Presocratics, the topics tobe covered are the difference between myth and theory, appearance and reality,and reason and sense-perception.  Socrates and the Sophists introduce intophilosophy a distinctly ethical dimension.  Thus, the topic will shift from adiscussion about the nature of the universe to a defense of the rational,ethical life.

How doesa social scientist decide that one explanation of a given set of events is morevalid than competing explanations?  What standards of judgment are appropriate?How do we decide?  One way to approach this question is to look closely at thearguments and assumptions of a particular text and evaluate their strengths andweaknesses. Another way is to look at conflicting interpretations of aparticular set of events and then try to decide which interpretation is better. We use both approaches. The aim of these detailed examinations will be todevelop skills and sensitivity in social scientific analysis.  We will payparticular attention to the advantages and limitations of various researchstrategies, to the questionable assumptions which may be hidden in researchtechniques, and to the grounds on which one interpretation of events is judgedto be better than another.   We also, in very practical and concrete ways,learn some of the basics of social science research methods.  SociologicalAnalysis is both an introduction to social scientific analysis, and to socialscience methods.  It is a course which has broad applicability and portability,one relevant to all the social sciences.In the course, we pay attention to the differences between the different socialsciences, to the differences between the social sciences and the naturalsciences, and to the differences between social scientific and historical formsof explanation.   Students learn to distinguish between nomothetic andidiographic forms of explanation.The heart of the course will involve learning how to use the social researchtechniques demonstrated in the readings, to help you evaluate research done byothers and to plan how to do research of your own.  There will be a number ofshort papers, which are intended to give experience in particular researchskills.  The assignments may be thought of as stages in a research project. The first assignment is to identify a particular social science research topic.The next step is to explore the literature.   For this assignment, we have twoworkshop computer lab sessions to introduce students to bibliographicresources. The result is an annotated bibliography.  The next assignment is towrite a research review of the most important literature relevant to theresearch topic. The final project will be to write a research proposal in whichthe research topic is restated as a research question.In this paper, students propose a plan for research to gather data to answerthe research question.

As such, this course offers a window into thedevelopment of American literature and culture. Students will grapple withquestions such as: What is “American” about American Literature? Whatqualifies something as particularly “American” (and not, say, moreinclusively – a global great work – or more restrictedly – great works ofAfrican-American, regional fiction, American women’s literature, etc)?  Docanonized works of American literature construct a certain vision of the nationand its cultural histories?  Many “great works” students will considereffectively portray distinctively “American” elements while simultaneouslycritiquing visions of American society and identity.  Does this challenge orassist their status as canonized works of American literature?                        What dothesegreat works of American literature tell us about America? To consider thesequestions more fully, this course broadly surveys a representative range oftexts that have been used to define what it means to be “American”alongside a more diverse body of “great works of American Literature.” Byexamining a range of writing by women and men from various cultural, ethnic,and political traditions, the aim of this course is to both introduce studentsto the practices of reading literature as well as to expose them to a sense ofthe development of what we might call the U.S. experience. In both versions ofthe class students will read a wide range of works – which may includespiritual autobiographies, travel narratives, slave narratives, poetry, shortstories, sermons, political tracts, novels, and essays – to engage inimportant contemporary debates over slavery, colonialism, changing definitionsof race, the emergence of nationalism, and the nature of citizenship.                   Additional Aims specific to English 152w: English 152W offers opportunities to engage the practices, habits, andconventions of college literacies, especially as they often occur in theHumanities.

The musical componentcorresponds to Music 1, which is an introductory course in Music Appreciation.  The first three sessions are devoted to the elements of music such as melody,harmony, meter, musical instruments and the orchestra, musical styles andnotation.   Following a quiz on the elements of music, a survey of masterpiecesof Western music covers the Medieval period through the twenty-first century.The music of the last three centuries is stressed (Baroque, Classical,Romantic, Impressionist and Contemporary) as these are the most likely works tobe encountered in the concert hall today and on the radio or televisionbroadcasts from Lincoln Center or elsewhere. Towards the latter part of thesemester, particularly with Impressionism and Contemporary trends, the art andmusic components are in tandem. The historical, cultural and stylistic elementsof the musical works are discussed, and in addition to an introductory text(Joseph Machlis, The Enjoyment of Music), the students have four compact discswith representative compositions which they can listen to as often as theywish. The music component stresses the European scene (mostly Italy, German,France and England) and the United States (in the twentieth century). Withregard to vocal works, either the textbook is used (which has the original textand translation side by side) or sheets are distributed in class. The goal ofthe music component is to give the student a basic appreciation of Westernmusic, and the listening skills with which to enjoy it. Art history in the ACE curriculum is more than giving students an exposure tothe fine arts, and making them aware of the broader cultural contexts of worksof art in general. The ACE curriculum seeks to generate an interest in inquiry,both scholastic and personal, so that the student can understand some of thebasic concepts behind exploring great works of art, and then use these toolsfor further development; the works become an approach to personal discovery.The course is constructed as an active dialogue between teacher and student, inwhich the students are encouraged to participate in the meaning of works asthey were originally intended to be seen, and as they are interpreted today. The works chosen for each lesson illustrate a particular culture: i.e.Byzantine Greek, ancient Rome, France during the Romantic period, etc. Worksare studied in their own right, as well as reflections of the societies thatgave birth to them.",7 May 2010 19:40:26 GMT,Not Applicable,6,None,Existing,ACE 004,Every Semester,,2-Jan-10,35,Appreciating and Participating in the Arts (AP),United States (US),Richard,Adams,richard.adams@qc.cuny.edu,ACE,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mr.,Richard,Adams,,,,,richard.adams@qc.cuny.edu155,155X-P4H2G5D8H4,SPAN 060: Hispanic Literatures in the United States,Barbara Simerka,3-Mar-10,"An overview of the literary production of Latinos in the United States.

Webegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, andcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticismof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as asocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history. Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,the development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how thesocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meaningsin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, theactions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and thesocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                     We compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews andItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20thcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become “white” ethic groups. Finally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racismsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, thehousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,including white race projects and white privilege.  Our goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race issocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race andbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  The second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as achanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups withsurrounding social institutions.
