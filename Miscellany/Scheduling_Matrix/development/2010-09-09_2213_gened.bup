164	164X-D2J3G4E4J7	927	211	never	Suzanne Strickland	2010-05-12	12-May-10	This course is an introduction to the study of race and ethnicity.  In the\rfirst part of the course we focus mainly upon the U.S. experience of\rblacks/whites because this experience has been so central to U.S. development\rand because the black/white social structure has been a model for how racism\rwas applied to other non-white and inferior white races in the U.S.  \rOur focus on race develops a sociological and historical analysis of race as a\rsocial structural relationship that entails social practices and ideology.  We\rbegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, and\rcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticism\rof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as a\rsocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history.\r Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,\rthe development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how the\rsocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meanings\rin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, the\ractions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and the\rsocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                           \rWe compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews and\rItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20th\rcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become “white” ethic groups. \rFinally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racism\rsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, the\rhousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,\rincluding white race projects and white privilege.  \r\rOur goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race is\rsocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race and\rbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  \r\rThe second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as a\rchanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups with\rsurrounding social institutions.  Assimilation/ resistance to assimilation is\rour central problematic.   We examine aspects of the immigration and ethnic\rdevelopment of the late 19th and early 20th century and the sociological theory\rused to account for ethnicity and assimilation.  We examine a new sociological\rtheory of assimilation that incorporates and revises the older sociological\rtheory and is primarily a response to the “new” immigrations that begin\raround 1970.                    We compare the social conditions faced by the\rdescendants\rof\rearly and new immigrants as well as how their ideas and values changed and are\rchanging.     We compare the experience of the second generation of three\rdifferent “new” ethnic groups and how their assimilation rates are \raffected by the diverse social, human and financial capital of their immigrant\rparents, U.S. laws and political institutions, and U.S. capitalism in the light\rof a globalized economy, the ease of international transportation and\rcommunication, and their non-whiteness.  \r\rOur goal is to enable students to reflect upon the changing nature of ethnicity\rand why groups assimilate at different rates, the changing nature of theory in\rrelation to new experience, and, given the ethnic diversity of QC, we want to\rprovide students with some tools to reflect upon their own experience.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	3	35	 Ethnic and Race Relations

This course will focus\ron the study of the contributions made by Italian filmmakers to the art form of\rcinema from early experimentation in neorealism in the 1940s till the present.\rEach time the course will focus on a specific topic and historical period.\rStudents will learn the history of cinema in Italy, and will study the\rinnovations in form, narrative and aesthetics introduced by Italian filmmakers.\rIn particular, students will be trained to look at Italian cinema in a global\rperspective on account of its international breadth and the impact their\rtechnological innovations had on the history of global cinema. In addition,\rstudents will learn to make aesthetic judgments, and will train their critical\rfaculties in a way that will help them to better understand all forms of visual\rmedia--including plastic arts, television, advertising, and the internet. This\rwill help them in their approach to such media in their daily lives, as well as\rgive them the critical thinking skills to bring to bear on other disciplines at\rQueens College. Cinema is by nature interdisciplinary and calls on fields as\rdisparate as history, art history, literature, media studies, psychology,\rsociology etc. for a deeper understanding of the implications contained in each\rfilm.  As Italian cinema is an integral part of Italian culture, we will\ranalyze how the traditions of Western European thought manifest themselves in\rtwentieth-century Italian culture, and in Italian cinema in particular. This\rcourse meets the aims of the Appreciating and Participating in the Arts section\rof the PLAS by training students in the “skills of observing and listening to\r[…] and appreciating and understanding the creative arts,” thereby helping\rstudents to “develop awareness of the role of these arts in human life.”	3	\N	None	t	Every Fall	None	1	25	 Italian Cinema.

79	79X-I0A8J3G5I3	915	122	never	Vinod Menon	2008-10-14	14-Oct-08	This course is the second semester of the algebra based introductory physics\rcourse, where new fundamental concepts of classical physics are introduced and\rdiscussed. Among main topics studied in this course are sound and wave\rphenomena, electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamic phenomena, nature and\rproperties of light. The unification of physical laws where the ultimate goal\ris to give a unified description of apparently unrelated phenomena is one of\rthe ongoing quests and the study of electrodynamics and optics exposes students\rto first steps in this direction. The idea of unity of nature emerged as a main\rscientific theme of last two centuries as a result of unification of\relectricity and magnetism into electrodynamics, and reducing optics to\relectromagnetism. Also, given the fact that no other scientific discipline\rinfluenced culture and technology more than electrodynamics (think electricity\rand electronics), the proposed course will help students to understand how\rscientific ideas can shape modern society. The course also introduces the\rstudents to some of the modern physics concepts such as special relativity and\rthe wave particle duality of matter.\r        Interaction between students and teaching staff is organized in the\rform of three components: lectures, recitations and labs.  Students learn\rmaterial, however, not only during scheduled class times, but also during their\rpreparation for classes. The preparation includes: reading a textbook and\radditional reading materials, solving homework problems, performing other\rassignments such as preparing talks, writing blogs, etc. as deemed necessary by\ran instructor.\rMain goal of lectures is to deliver the main conceptual content of the studied\rmaterial. Organization of lectures depends on individual styles of professors\rteaching the course, but active involvement of students in discussion of the\rsubject matter will always be one of the main means of achieving this goal.\rRecitations play a more technical role: during recitations students sharpen\rtheir practical skill in applying new concepts to typical situations occurring\rin real life or during scientific inquiry. During labs, students are introduced\rto and obtain hands-on experience of empirical methods of scientific inquiry.\rThey learn to design meaningful scientific experiments, use basic measuring\rdevices and instruments, collect and analyze experimental data to make\rreasonable scientific inferences. \r        Topics in this class include: \rWaves and Sound\rElectrostatics: Electric charges and their interaction, Coulomb law, Gauss’s\rlaw, electric field, electrostatic potential, potential energy of systems of\rcharges, capacitors and their applications     \rDirect electric current: Electric current, resistance and resistivity, Ohm’s\rlaw, Kirchhoff’s rules\rMagnetostatics: Magnetic field and magnetic force on charges and currents, the\rBiot-Savart and Ampere’s laws\rElectromagnetic phenomena: magnetic induction and Faraday’s law, Lenz’s law,\rmagnetic energy, alternating-current circuits, and electromagnetic waves\rOptics: geometric optics and optical instruments, light as electromagnetic\rwave, polarization,\r dispersion, diffraction and interference\rModern Physics: Special theory of relativity, nature of atom and wave-particle\rduality of matter.	4	\N	Physics 121, Algebra and Trigonometry	t	Every Semester	None	4	24	 General Physics II
39	39X-E9J8G8H3B0	853	150	never	Barbara Waldinger	\N	Old	How do plays “hold the mirror up to nature?”  What do we learn about “the very\rage and body of the time” by reading plays, learning about theatrical practices\rand enacting scenes?\r        This course connects dramatic literature from various time periods with\rthe culture and beliefs of people who lived during those times.\r\r        Students will spend seven weeks reading and analyzing plays written by\rChristopher Marlowe and several early plays of William Shakespeare.  We will\rcompare Shakespeare’s Richard II to Marlowe’s Edward II; Shakespeare’s Richard\rIII to Marlowe’s Dr. Faustus; Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice to Marlowe’s The\rJew of Malta and Shakespeare’s violent Titus Andronicus\r\r        The second half of the semester will familiarize the students with\rElizabethan society and the issues facing the playwrights who wrote during that\rera.  Using the Reacting to the Past pedagogy in a role-play situation designed\rby Professor Eric Mallin, ( Marlowe and Shakespeare, 1592), the class will be\rdivided into three groups: The Lord Strange’s Men (led by Richard Burbage), The\rLord Admiral’s Men (led by Edward Alleyn), and Queen Elizabeth’s Privy Council\r(historical figures who advise Her Majesty).  Each student will research and\rassume the role of a specific figure of the time.   We will set up a contest\rbetween the two troupes, who, by means of oral and written arguments gleaned\rfrom a variety of primary and secondary documents, as well as  performances,\rattempt to persuade the Privy Council to select either The Jew of Malta or\rTitus Andronicus to be produced at Henslowe’s Rose Theatre in 1592.  \r\r        Role-play is a theatrical technique used by many disciplines in order\rto allow students to “walk a mile in the moccasins” of another being.  In their\rRenaissance roles, students will experience firsthand the dangerous political\ratmosphere of the time, the difficulties faced by the playwrights in skirting\rthe censors, and  the reception their work was given by ordinary people as well\ras those in authority.                    They will learn about the class system and\rfind\rthe\rplace of their characters within it.   Twenty-first century actors will learn\rhow unimportant they become in a society ruled by a powerful monarch, one in\rwhich they need the protection of members of the nobility to survive in their\rlowly profession.  Through their reading of primary documents (such as letters,\rroyal proclamations, playbills, handbooks, treatises), students will compare\rand contrast life in the Renaissance with their contemporary points of view.  \rThey will need to filter their way of thinking through the lens of the English\rRenaissance.   In 1592 London, how does one survive and achieve success in a\rprofession, in the family, in marriage, in church, in society?                    How\rhave\rthese\rgoals changed today both in our country and abroad?\r\rPossible Course Variations:\r\ra) In the fall of 08, I will be teaching this variant: in the first half of the\rsemester students read and analyze the following Greek plays (The Orestaia by\rAeschylus, Antigone by Sophocles, Medea by Euripides, and Lysistrata and The\rClouds by Aristophanes).  Students will come to understand the society during\rwhich these playwrights plied their trade, through dramatic  literature and the\rstudy of historical texts. The second half will involve the students in a\rrole-playing situation designed by Professor Mark Carnes and Josiah Ober:  The\rThreshold of Democracy: Athens in 403 B.C.  After reading Plato’s Republic and\rother historical documents, students will re-enact the trial of Socrates and\rreflect on the value of democracy in the aftermath of the Peloponnesian Wars. \r\rb) In the fall of 07, I taught this variant: in the first half of the semester\rstudents read and analyzed plays of the French Classical Theatre, leading up to\rthe French Revolution: (Racine’s Phaedra, Corneille’s Le Cid,  Moliere’s The\rIntellectual Ladies, Marivaux’s The Game of Love and Chance and Beaumarchais’s\rThe Barber of Seville and The Marriage of Figaro).  Students begin to\runderstand how drama developed from a genre devoted to the aristocracy, to one\rof the people and their attempt to secure a place in society.                  The\rsecond\rhalf\rof the semester was devoted to a role-play situation designed by Professors\rMark Carnes and Gary Kates:   Rousseau, Burke, and Revolution in France, 1791. \rAfter reading Rousseau’s Social Contract and selections from Burke’s\rReflections on the Revolution in France, students play the roles of the various\rpost-Revolution factions, each with their own ideas of how to create a new\rgovernment out of the ruins of the old one.	3	\N	None	f	Every Semester	None	None	None	 Theatrical texts and times

The musical component\rcorresponds to Music 1, which is an introductory course in Music Appreciation. \r The first three sessions are devoted to the elements of music such as melody,\rharmony, meter, musical instruments and the orchestra, musical styles and\rnotation.   Following a quiz on the elements of music, a survey of masterpieces\rof Western music covers the Medieval period through the twenty-first century.\rThe music of the last three centuries is stressed (Baroque, Classical,\rRomantic, Impressionist and Contemporary) as these are the most likely works to\rbe encountered in the concert hall today and on the radio or television\rbroadcasts from Lincoln Center or elsewhere. Towards the latter part of the\rsemester, particularly with Impressionism and Contemporary trends, the art and\rmusic components are in tandem. The historical, cultural and stylistic elements\rof the musical works are discussed, and in addition to an introductory text\r(Joseph Machlis, The Enjoyment of Music), the students have four compact discs\rwith representative compositions which they can listen to as often as they\rwish. The music component stresses the European scene (mostly Italy, German,\rFrance and England) and the United States (in the twentieth century). With\rregard to vocal works, either the textbook is used (which has the original text\rand translation side by side) or sheets are distributed in class. The goal of\rthe music component is to give the student a basic appreciation of Western\rmusic, and the listening skills with which to enjoy it. \r\rArt history in the ACE curriculum is more than giving students an exposure to\rthe fine arts, and making them aware of the broader cultural contexts of works\rof art in general. The ACE curriculum seeks to generate an interest in inquiry,\rboth scholastic and personal, so that the student can understand some of the\rbasic concepts behind exploring great works of art, and then use these tools\rfor further development; the works become an approach to personal discovery.\r\rThe course is constructed as an active dialogue between teacher and student, in\rwhich the students are encouraged to participate in the meaning of works as\rthey were originally intended to be seen, and as they are interpreted today. \rThe works chosen for each lesson illustrate a particular culture: i.e.\rByzantine Greek, ancient Rome, France during the Romantic period, etc. Works\rare studied in their own right, as well as reflections of the societies that\rgave birth to them.	6	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	1 to 2	35	 Studies in Visual Arts and Music

In\r1973, Theodore Dobzhansky, one of the most influential figures in evolutionary\rbiology, wrote “Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of\revolution.” This course pursues an integrative approach to the study of human\revolution. Situating humans within the animal kingdom as members of the Primate\rOrder, students are introduced to evolution from multiple perspectives:\rmolecular genetics, population genetics, and the fossil record; on multiple\rlevels, including molecular, organismic, population, species, and higher order\rtaxonomic units. This class also relates the theory of evolution to other\rfields of scientific inquiry: biological systematics, ethology, morphology,\rbiomechanics, and geology. \rThe course is designed to achieve PLAS goals as follows:\r1. To demonstrate how biological anthropology and evolutionary biology create\rknowledge and understanding, this course introduces the students to the\rscientific method and its role in developing our understandings of how\revolution has shaped our species and produced biological variation among modern\rhumans. This course aims to make students aware of the investigative roles of\robservation, construction and testing of research hypotheses, experimental\rdesign, and data analysis.\r2. To position biological anthropology and evolutionary biology within the\rliberal arts and the larger society, using human evolution as a central theme.\rLiberal arts refer to a college or university curriculum aimed at imparting\rgeneral knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities in contrast to\ra professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. This course illustrates\rhow core biological concepts relate to our understanding of the origins of our\rspecies, as well as exposing the connections between humans and non-human\rprimates. Throughout the course there will be an emphasis on the ways in which\rscientists learn about human evolution and the significance of human evolution\rfor understanding humans today.\r3. To introduce students to a body of knowledge at the core of the natural\rsciences: the biological basis of life, the basics of cell biology and\rmolecular genetics, Mendelian genetics, population genetics, systematics,\rmolecular phylogeny, cladistic analysis, behavioral studies, biomechanics, and\ranalysis of the fossil record. \r4. To enhance quantitative reasoning among students through assignments that\remploy quantitative exercises in the context of evolutionary theory.\r5. To introduce students to the primary sources of literature on human\revolution and other primary materials such as the skeletons of non-human\rprimates and replicas of fossils related to human evolution.\r6. To reveal the existence and importance of change through time, the natural\rprocesses that result in biological change across the generations are the\rprimary focus of this course. The course discusses how natural selection,\rmutations, gene flow, and genetic drift result in biological change over time.\rThe course also examines the fossil record as a direct source of evidence of\rbiological change.\r7. To illuminate diversity, as well as the nature and construction of forms of\rdifference, this course considers how the forces of evolution have shaped\rbiological variation in modern humans and examines how environmental variation\raround the world, as well as the distribution of pathogens, has affected\rstature and body proportions, pigmentation, and the distribution of other\rheritable traits in different human populations.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	5 to 8	45-120	 Introduction to Human Evolution

The class will examine a wide range of\rprose styles and narrative approaches, from realism to “magic realism” and\rwill also pay particular attention to the varied approaches to language the\rwriters employ. We will read the highly polished prose of one of the\racknowledged masters of English language writing, James Joyce; we’ll read the\rwriting of the Polish-born novelist, Conrad; the hybrid languages of Diaz,\rRushdie, Smith; the magical and fantastical language of Garcia Marquez. The\rassumption of this class is that each writer’s style and language use is the\rresult not only of his or her aesthetic choices but also the writer’s place\rin time and the writer’s response to the form of English available (the\robvious exception is Garcia Marquez, whose work we’ll read in translation).\rTherefore, we will be trying to understand how the writer uses his or her\rresources to create meaning, and, moreover, meaning through what in each case\ris a “borrowed” language.\rWe shall also take a sampling of the critical literature as it abuts our\rconcerns.\rThe writings are chosen for their importance and for their ability to be framed\ras representative of trends,concerns, and literary value.

Students will read poetry, short\rfiction, novels, plays,  essays, political studies, autobiographies, and travel\rnarratives. In addition, the course offers a sampling of theoretical reading\rand readings in criticism.\r\rThis course seeks to challenge students by posing offering questions for their\rconsideration: What are the qualities of a national literature? How do writers\rof different backgrounds respond to similar circumstances?  What are the\rdifficulties inherent in forming a literary language from the leavings of\rcolonialism? What are the effects of exile or diaspora upon the literary\rimagination? How does the writer make use of his or her own “national\rculture”? Or, conversely, what is his or her relationship to a metropolitan\rculture? How are the realities of race and class confronted in individual\rtexts? Is the writer a spokesperson for “his people”? Or should she be?\rThe course seeks to confront these questions through close readings of primary\rtexts that would include fiction, non-fiction prose, poetry, and drama; the\rcourse will also allow and encourage students to read these texts through a\rcritical lens provided by various critics and theorists.

This\rcourse and its companion, Global Literatures I, aim to provide students with a\rgreater awareness of the global cultural contexts in which literary works are\rcreated (which is intended to enhance rather than diminish consideration of the\raesthetic qualities of these texts).  The course draws its assigned readings\rfrom roughly the 16th century C.E. to the present day, focusing on the\rincreasing complexity of transcultural encounters that, taken together,\rconstitute the modern world.\r\rThis is intended to be a variable-topics course, and its instructor(s) will\rhave broad leeway to shape its specific content and emphases in a given\rsemester, while preserving a cross-cultural, comparative orientation that\rsituates the selected texts in the wider world(s) of their marking.  Sample\rtopics could be: Representations of the Individual,\rDiscoveries/Encounters/Conquests, The Literature of War, Love in the Modern\rWorld, The Literature of Exile, Representations of Death, The Modern Epic, etc.\r\rSample Topic:\r\rColonialism/Anti-Colonialism.  One of the major struggles that shaped what we\rknow as the “modern world” involved a conflict between the people and ideas\rthat constituted the colonial project - the occupation, expropriation, and\rforced exploitation by European (and later United States) capitalism of entire\rpeoples and regions of the globe in the name of “civilization” and “economic\rdevelopment” - and those who were subjected to this regime of control.               \r     \r\rFor all\rtheir failings in certain regards, anti-colonial struggles, which intensified\rduring the post-World War II era in Africa and Asia, did succeed in changing\rthe map and the way we look at the world now.  Some say that we are now in a\rpostcolonial order, and others that colonialism is still very much with us in\rnew forms.  In order to make sense of these debates, and the present global\rmoment as a whole, it is useful to examine the literature that came out of\rcolonialism and the resistance to it.  Beginning with the Martiniquan poet Aimé\rCésaire’s violent denunciation of the racism and dehumanization integral to the\rtheory and practice of colonialism, this course juxtaposes representative (and\rfrequently critical) literary writings by carriers of the colonial project with\rworks by those brought up under colonialism and prepared to use its own weapons\r(including literary ones) to undermine and destroy it.                               \r     \rReadings\rare\rdrawn from\rthe Caribbean, South Asia, Central and Eastern Africa, and the Maghreb (North\rAfrica).	3	\N	English 110	t	Every Semester	None	6 to 10	25	 Global Literatures II

This course aims to introduce students to learn how\rto\ranalyze\rliterary texts and how to write about a literary work; therefore, this course\rcombines a study of literature with continued training in clear and effective\rwritten expression.  The overriding aim is to give students an appreciation of\rthe three main literary forms and to develop a respect for the power of diverse\rliterary expressions and the ways literature affects our imagination and\rreveals the human condition.

As such, this course offers a window into the\rdevelopment of American literature and culture. Students will grapple with\rquestions such as: What is “American” about American Literature? What\rqualifies something as particularly “American” (and not, say, more\rinclusively – a global great work – or more restrictedly – great works of\rAfrican-American, regional fiction, American women’s literature, etc)?  Do\rcanonized works of American literature construct a certain vision of the nation\rand its cultural histories?  Many “great works” students will consider\reffectively portray distinctively “American” elements while simultaneously\rcritiquing visions of American society and identity.  Does this challenge or\rassist their status as canonized works of American literature?                       \r \rWhat do\rthese\rgreat works of American literature tell us about America? To consider these\rquestions more fully, this course broadly surveys a representative range of\rtexts that have been used to define what it means to be “American”\ralongside a more diverse body of “great works of American Literature.” By\rexamining a range of writing by women and men from various cultural, ethnic,\rand political traditions, the aim of this course is to both introduce students\rto the practices of reading literature as well as to expose them to a sense of\rthe development of what we might call the U.S. experience. In both versions of\rthe class students will read a wide range of works – which may include\rspiritual autobiographies, travel narratives, slave narratives, poetry, short\rstories, sermons, political tracts, novels, and essays – to engage in\rimportant contemporary debates over slavery, colonialism, changing definitions\rof race, the emergence of nationalism, and the nature of citizenship.               \r    \r\rAdditional Aims specific to English 152w: \r\rEnglish 152W offers opportunities to engage the practices, habits, and\rconventions of college literacies, especially as they often occur in the\rHumanities.  It is a course that emphasizes reading, thinking, speaking, and\rwriting and the interactions among them.  Students will practice both how to\runderstand and how to think critically about the ideas and language of others\rthrough our reading and through class discussions and how to articulate their\rown meaningful responses to the ideas and language of others through their\rwriting. Close reading and critical analysis of a wide variety of primary\rmaterials of various periods.  This course combines the study of literature\rwith continued training in clear and effective written expression.\r\rIn the academic year 2009-2010 the English Department would like to offer one\rsection of this course as a jumbo lecture section. We are designing this\rsection as a pilot to see if this version of the course will be a viable\rpedagogical model for the department and our students.

In the\rfirst part of the course we focus mainly upon the U.S. experience of\rblacks/whites because this experience has been so central to U.S. development\rand because the black/white social structure has been a model for how racism\rwas applied to other non-white and inferior white races in the U.S.  \rOur focus on race develops a sociological and historical analysis of race as a\rsocial structural relationship that entails social practices and ideology.  We\rbegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, and\rcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticism\rof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as a\rsocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history.\r Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,\rthe development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how the\rsocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meanings\rin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, the\ractions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and the\rsocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                     \rWe compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews and\rItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20th\rcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become “white” ethic groups. \rFinally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racism\rsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, the\rhousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,\rincluding white race projects and white privilege.  \r\rOur goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race is\rsocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race and\rbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  \r\rThe second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as a\rchanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups with\rsurrounding social institutions.  Assimilation/ resistance to assimilation is\rour central problematic.   We examine aspects of the immigration and ethnic\rdevelopment of the late 19th and early 20th century and the sociological theory\rused to account for ethnicity and assimilation.  We examine a new sociological\rtheory of assimilation that incorporates and revises the older sociological\rtheory and is primarily a response to the “new” immigrations that begin\raround 1970.                We compare the social conditions faced by the\rdescendants\rof\rearly and new immigrants as well as how their ideas and values changed and are\rchanging.     We compare the experience of the second generation of three\rdifferent “new” ethnic groups and how their assimilation rates are \raffected by the diverse social, human and financial capital of their immigrant\rparents, U.S. laws and political institutions, and U.S. capitalism in the light\rof a globalized economy, the ease of international transportation and\rcommunication, and their non-whiteness.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	3	35	 Race and Ethnic Relations

In line with the dictum of influential 20th century\revolutionist/geneticist, Theodosius Dobzhansky, that “Nothing in biology makes\rsense except in the light of evolution”, students explore evolutionary\rprinciples as a means of understanding the structure and adaptations of diverse\rlife forms, including humanity itself.

What standards of judgment are appropriate?\rHow do we decide?  One way to approach this question is to look closely at the\rarguments and assumptions of a particular text and evaluate their strengths and\rweaknesses. Another way is to look at conflicting interpretations of a\rparticular set of events and then try to decide which interpretation is better.\r We use both approaches. The aim of these detailed examinations will be to\rdevelop skills and sensitivity in social scientific analysis.  We will pay\rparticular attention to the advantages and limitations of various research\rstrategies, to the questionable assumptions which may be hidden in research\rtechniques, and to the grounds on which one interpretation of events is judged\rto be better than another.   We also, in very practical and concrete ways,\rlearn some of the basics of social science research methods.  Sociological\rAnalysis is both an introduction to social scientific analysis, and to social\rscience methods.  It is a course which has broad applicability and portability,\rone relevant to all the social sciences.\r\rIn the course, we pay attention to the differences between the different social\rsciences, to the differences between the social sciences and the natural\rsciences, and to the differences between social scientific and historical forms\rof explanation.   Students learn to distinguish between nomothetic and\ridiographic forms of explanation.\r\rThe heart of the course will involve learning how to use the social research\rtechniques demonstrated in the readings, to help you evaluate research done by\rothers and to plan how to do research of your own.  There will be a number of\rshort papers, which are intended to give experience in particular research\rskills.  The assignments may be thought of as stages in a research project. \rThe first assignment is to identify a particular social science research topic.\r\rThe next step is to explore the literature.   For this assignment, we have two\rworkshop computer lab sessions to introduce students to bibliographic\rresources. The result is an annotated bibliography.  The next assignment is to\rwrite a research review of the most important literature relevant to the\rresearch topic. The final project will be to write a research proposal in which\rthe research topic is restated as a research question.\r\rIn this paper, students propose a plan for research to gather data to answer\rthe research question. Along the way, there are a number of short exercises to\rprovide hands-on experience with various skills and analytic techniques.

Socialist societies and western democracies are\rfacing basic questions about their systems and values. To comprehend the\rstaggering events unfolding in the news media everyday, it is essential to have\rfamiliarity with sociological theories and explanations. \r\rSociology is one the many different disciplines in the liberal arts from which\rto look at the world and ourselves in it. It is a discipline which challenges\rconventional wisdom, dissolves myths about social reality, and studies how\rhuman interaction is responsible for the social world and much of individual\rexperience and identity.  \r\rThe course is designed to expose students to a framework for understanding\rindividual actions in the social context.  It offers an introduction to the\rbasic concepts, theories, methods, and findings of sociology that help describe\rand explain the sociopolitical, socioeconomic, cultural, and organizational\rstructures of society. This course will teach students “sociological\rimagination.” Students will apply theories and explanations to a wide range of\rtopics including social inequality, gender and family, race and ethnicity, the\reducational and health care systems, and aging. \r\rIn addition to using a textbook, readings will include original writings of key\rthinkers and scholars in the discipline as well as the findings of recent\rstudies.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	20	45	 Introduction to Sociology
115	115X-G9G2G0A5I1	927	211	never	Martin Eisenberg	\N	Old	This course is an introduction to the study of race and ethnicity.  In the\rfirst part of the course we focus mainly upon the U.S. experience of\rblacks/whites because this experience has been so central to U.S. development\rand because the black/white social structure has been a model for how racism\rwas applied to other non-white and inferior white races in the U.S.  \rOur focus on race develops a sociological and historical analysis of race as a\rsocial structural relationship that entails social practices and ideology.  We\rbegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, and\rcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticism\rof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as a\rsocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history.\r Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,\rthe development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how the\rsocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meanings\rin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, the\ractions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and the\rsocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                               \r \rWe compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews and\rItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20th\rcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become “white” ethic groups. \rFinally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racism\rsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, the\rhousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,\rincluding white race projects and white privilege.  \r\rOur goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race is\rsocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race and\rbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  \r\rThe second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as a\rchanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups with\rsurrounding social institutions.  Assimilation/ resistance to assimilation is\rour central problematic.   We examine aspects of the immigration and ethnic\rdevelopment of the late 19th and early 20th century and the sociological theory\rused to account for ethnicity and assimilation.  We examine a new sociological\rtheory of assimilation that incorporates and revises the older sociological\rtheory and is primarily a response to the “new” immigrations that begin around\r1970.                             We compare the social conditions faced by the\rdescendants of\rearly and\rnew immigrants as well as how their ideas and values changed and are changing. \r   We compare the experience of the second generation of three different “new”\rethnic groups and how their assimilation rates are  affected by the diverse\rsocial, human and financial capital of their immigrant parents, U.S. laws and\rpolitical institutions, and U.S. capitalism in the light of a globalized\reconomy, the ease of international transportation and communication, and their\rnon-whiteness.                                \r\rOur goal is to enable students to reflect upon the changing nature of ethnicity\rand why groups assimilate at different rates, the changing nature of theory in\rrelation to new experience, and, given the ethnic diversity of QC, we want to\rprovide students with some tools to reflect upon their own experience.	3	\N	101 Soc or 101 Anthropology	t	Every Semester	3	35	35	 Ethnic and Race Relations

American social welfare policy_as implemented\rthrough various institutions_creates the enabling conditions that permit\rAmerican citizens the “pursuit of happiness.”  The constitutional framers\radopted Aristotle’s definition of happiness and the path to achieving it.\rConsequently, this course exposes students to Aristotelian principles and the\rways in which these principles under grid American social welfare policy.  \r\rAmerican social welfare policy is at first influenced by English jurisprudence,\re.g., commonly referred to as “The English Poor Laws.”         By the mid 1800’s,\rsuccessive waves of immigrants from Europe begin to come to America, and this\rinflux challenges the European legal framework. America begins to understand\rthe immigrant experience_and its implication for democracy_through the eclectic\rcontributions made by social reformers, journalists, scientists, and the influx\rinto America of prominent European thinkers, who begin to modify their European\rperspectives by the American experience.  These forces shape American social\rwelfare institutions created in the 19th Century that begin to mediate between\rthe harshness of capitalism and the rights of man. \r\rIn the 20th Century, as America emerges as the leader of the free world, social\rwelfare institutions are again reshaped by economic and political changes in\rthe world and in the country.\r_____________________________________________________________________  \rCrafting social welfare policy in a democracy is a complex task that requires\rpolicy-makers to ask hard questions.   How does social welfare policy shape the\rcharacter of a citizen?  Can social welfare policy effectively promote\requality?  What constitutes good social policy; does empirical evidence prove\rthe efficacy of policy approaches, or are there broader theoretical questions\rthat define effectiveness?  To answer these questions, this course traces the\rphilosophical, economic, political and historic tributaries that shaped the\rUnited States’ social welfare system.  Students will gain an understanding of\rthe interplay of these factors, and how the contours of contemporary social\rpolicy continue to illustrate this complex weave of philosophical, economic,\rpolitical and historic events.               \r\r The first large-scale challenge to social welfare policy in America occurred\rwith the immigration of 1845.  Beyond the significance of integrating large\rwaves of immigrants, the Chicago experience begins to shape an indigenous\rAmerican Sociology.  We will examine the settlement house movement in Chicago\rand its significance to American social science by reading Jane Adams’s book,\rThe Spirit of Youth and The City Streets.  Class reading will also focus on\rJacob Riis’s parallel account of New York City’s immigrant experience.              \r\rThe class will define the evolution of government’s role in social welfare by\rfocusing first on Al Smith’s important influence as a ward boss from the Lower\rEast Side of New York City, to the governorship of New York, and finally to the\rnational stage as a candidate for the presidency.  Then we will discuss the\rcritical impact of Franklin Roosevelt’s policies as governor of New York and\rlater as president.  These policies had a far reaching impact in building a\rfederal role for social welfare.   \r\rExamining Post-WW II America, the class will analyze how government policies of\rthe late 1940’s and 1950’s contributed to prosperity for many Americans, but at\rthe same time, as Michael Harrington posited, these strategies created serious\r”social deficits” for southern blacks, displaced industrial workers and the\relderly.  The Other America, by Michael Harrington explains why America needed\rto fight The War on Poverty to help those at risk.  The Great Society sought to\rredress these “social deficits,” but several theorists argued that the\rstrategies developed to ameliorate the problems did not achieve that goal. We\rwill examine the empirical evidence used to evaluate these programs to discern\rwhat some of the failures were.  Losing Ground by Charles Murray provides a\rprovocative explanation for this failure. This examination formed the basis for\rthe welfare reform overall of 1994. \r\rThe last part of the course will define the current social welfare challenges\rposed in the 21st Century.	3	\N	Pre-requisites include Soc 101 or Anth 101 or Econ 101 or Fnes 106 or Hss1 or Psci 100 or Psci 101 or Urbst 101.	t	Every Semester	None	1	45	 Social Welfare as a Social Institution

Of course, some time will be spent on\rPlato’s works about Socrates.  With respect to the Presocratics, the topics to\rbe covered are the difference between myth and theory, appearance and reality,\rand reason and sense-perception.  Socrates and the Sophists introduce into\rphilosophy a distinctly ethical dimension.  Thus, the topic will shift from a\rdiscussion about the nature of the universe to a defense of the rational,\rethical life.  The course then delves into Plato’s works that deal with his\rpsychological theory, his epistemology, his theory of Forms, and his views on\rthe nature of reality in general.  Aristotle not only works out many of Plato’s\rideas within his own system, but also gives a new direction to philosophy\rtowards formalization; therefore, the course will begin by examining his\rlogical works, then it will focus on his physics and metaphysics, and, lastly,\rhis psychology.

As a rule some attention will also be given to issues in one or\rmore of ethics, aesthetics, political philosophy, philosophy of science, and\rphilosophy of religion.  How much to include in Philosophy 101 is always\rdifficult to decide.  Different instructors decide the matter differently, and\rthe same instructor may decide the matter differently from one semester to the\rnext.  The aim shared by all is to encourage students to strive for consistent\rand reasonable views of their own, mindful of the contrasting views of notable\rphilosophers, on such main problems of philosophy as the following from\repistemology and metaphysics:\r     Questions of epistemology (theories about human knowledge):\r          1. What distinguishes knowledge from opinion?  How, if at all, is\rknowledge obtainable?\r          2. Is there any knowledge which is so certain that no reasonable\rperson could doubt it?\r          3. Do the natural sciences give us knowledge?  The social sciences?\r          4. Are there limits to what we can know?  If so, how can we know what\rthey are?\r          5. What is truth?  Is it relative?   \r     Questions of metaphysics (theories as to the nature of reality):\r          1. Is it possible that the universe might not have existed?  If so,\rwhy does it exist?\r          2. What in the universe is fundamentally real?  Matter?  Mind?  Both?\r          3. Are the things we perceive by means of our bodily senses (sight,\rtouch, and so on) really  \r              just what they appear to be, or is there a difference between\rappearance and reality?\r          4. Is there a cause for everything that happens, including every\rhuman thought and action?\r          5. What is the nature of human selfhood or personality?  Is this to\rbe understood in terms\r              of a distinction between mind and body?\r\rThese are issues typically canvassed in Philosophy 101.

The course aims to promote critical reflection on\rthese issues and to encourage students to strive for their own reasoned\rpostions on them. To these ends, the students will be invited and assisted both\r(a) to achieve a good understanding of the arguments of the philosophers\rassigned, so that they can explain the philosophers’ assumptions, inferences,\rand conclusions accurately in their own words, and (b) to evaluate for\rthemselves the truth of philosophers’ assumptions and the validity of their\rinferences, with a view to determining whether these moral philosophers have\restablished their conclusions. The course fulfills Queens College’s general\reducation requirement under the Culture and Values heading of Perspectives on\rthe Liberal Arts and Sciences, for it examines contrasting views as to the\rattainability of knowledge in ethics; it aims, as representing a core liberal\rart (namely, philosophy), to develop general intellectual capacities such as\rreason and judgement, in the belief that both the individual and society are\rthe better for such development; and it investigates major issues concerning\rmoral values.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	6	40	 Introduction to Ethics

This first laboratory course in\rchemistry, therefore, is designed to give students a set of fundamental\rlaboratory techniques which will lay a foundation for study in all of the\rsciences, as well as in advanced chemistry.\r\rQuantitative and abstract reasoning are emphasized throughout, beginning with a\rcomprehensive requirement for mastery of the analysis of dimensions and units,\rthe precision of scientific data, and error analysis during the first\rlaboratory period.  Starting from the fundamental physical principle of the\rconservation of energy and mass, chemical transformations are investigated with\ran emphasis on quantitative precision (Laboratories 5, 6, 7 and 11) and\rqualitative completeness (Laboratories 3 - 5, 9).  A complete treatment of the\rmeasure of the elements - or stoichiometry - in Laboratories 5 and 6 provides\rthe basic tools for balancing chemical reactions and solving quantitative\rproblems stemming from these reactions.  As a result, students learn to predict\rwhat chemical species can be created from specific reactants, both in\rqualitative (Laboratory 6) and quantitative (Laboratory 11) terms.\r\rThe energetics of chemical change are contrasted to measures of spontaneity. \rChemical transformations are thereby classified as being either spontaneous or\rnonspontaneous, and the implications of spontaneity are explored from the point\rof view of intrinsic energy availability in Laboratories 5 and 6.  Chemical\rdynamics are explored in describing the rates of chemical transformations in\rLaboratories 12 and 13.\r\rThe structure of molecules comprises the basis for all modern theories of\rmaterials.  This requires a basic introduction to quantum phenomena and to\rnanoscale reasoning.  For this reason, students investigate the emission\rspectra of simple elements and diatomic compounds in Laboratory 10.  Following\rthe mastery of structural concepts, students are positioned to understand the\rself-organization of chemical systems that leads ultimately to the complex\rinteractions of biological macromolecules.	1	\N	A grade of C or better in MATH 115 (or equivalent).

Students learn\rmaterial, however, not only during scheduled class times, but also during their\rpreparation for classes. The preparation includes: reading a textbook and\radditional reading materials, solving homework problems, and performing other\rassignments deemed necessary by an instructor.\rMain goal of lectures is to deliver main conceptual content of the studied\rmaterial. Organization of lectures depends on individual styles of professors\rteaching the course, but active involvement of students in discussion of the\rsubject matter will always be one of the main means of achieving this goal. \rRecitations play a more technical role: during recitations students sharpen\rtheir practical skill in applying new concepts to typical situations occurring\rin real life or during scientific inquiry. \rDuring labs, students are introduced to and obtain hands-on experience of\rempirical methods of scientific inquiry. They learn to design meaningful\rscientific experiments, use basic measuring devices and instruments, collect\rand analyze experimental data to make reasonable scientific inferences. \r        Topics in this class include: \rMechanics: Kinematics (description of motion); projectile motion in everyday\rphenomena and in the history of physics, Newton’s laws as the foundation of a\rmechanical world view; models of the solar system from ancient Greeks to\rCopernicus and Kepler; Newton’s law of universal gravity and its implications\rfor astronomy, cosmology and space exploration; momentum and its conservation,\rkinematics of collisions; mechanical energy and its conservation, general\rconcept of energy and its application in physics and beyond; kinematics of\rrotation, absolutely rigid body as a new idealization  in physics; dynamics of\rrotation, torque, energy of rotation; hydrostatics and hydrodynamics,\rBernoulli’s equation and its role for aviation; oscillatory motion, simple\rharmonic oscillator as a universal model of linear oscillations.    \rElements of kinetics and thermodynamics: Statistical approach to systems of\rmany particles; ideal gas as the simplest model of a thermodynamic system;\rthermodynamic processes (isothermal, isobaric, isochoric, adiabatic); internal\renergy and the 1st law of thermodynamics; 2nd law of thermodynamics and heat\rengines; thermodynamics and industrial revolution; entropy.	4	\N	Math 151 or Math 141, 142	t	Every Semester	None	2	24	 Principles of Physics I

This course will examine the paintings, prints, and drawings on new,\rsecular subjects created in the seventeenth century in modern-day Belgium and\rthe Netherlands. These pictures have frequently been labeled “scenes of\reveryday life” as a result of the naturalistic representational modes with\rwhich they were crafted. We will devote attention to naturalism as a style and\ras an aesthetic, and interrogate its role in the critical debates over the\rmeaning of these images.  We will explore why an aesthetic rooted in everyday\rreality was consciously cultivated, and how cultural factors such as a newly\rproclaimed national independence,increasing secularization, the growing role of\robservation in the sciences, and a capitalist economy engaged in global trade\rshaped the new art of the period.

It is a reading course for undergraduates,\rwith an intersection of topics and concepts from linguistics, sociology,\ranthropology, psychology and education. It is designed for students interested\rin gaining a deeper understanding of some of the linguistic and cultural groups\rthat make up US society, and the issues that surround and confound them. Topics\rwill be related to issues and challenges of living in a multilingual,\rmulti-ethnic, multi-cultural US in the 21st century. We address the three main\rcriteria for a Perspectives Course as follows:\r\r        To gain knowledge and understanding of issues related to culture and\rvalues, students will read about diverse groups living in the US, who speak\rminority dialects (e.g. speakers of African American English) and various\rlanguages (e.g. Spanish, Chinese, American Sign Language), and thus belong to a\rwide range of cultural groups, representing unique values. Students will also\rread material on controversial issues of unique or common concern to these\rgroups (e.g. Should English be made the “official language” of the US?),\rexamining all sides of each issue and taking a position based on data and\revidence. From their readings of language diversity in the US, students will be\rasked to raise and respond to a set of questions, including: What is the\rhistory and pattern(s) of migration and settlement of a particular group? What\rare the particular values upon which the group’s culture is based, and how have\rthe individuals within the group contributed to US society? What challenges\rhave the people in this group faced in the past and continue to face in their\runique adjustment to US society? How have they met these challenges and which\rremain to be met?  Further questions related to particular groups will also be\rraised, particularly with respect to the challenges they face with respect to\rUS social, political, or educational institutions.	3	\N	None	f	Every Semester	None	2 to 4	30	 Multilingualism in the US
78	78X-C8D0G5G9C3	927	211	never	Martin Eisenberg	\N	Old	This course is an introduction to the study of race and ethnicity.  In the\rfirst part of the course we focus mainly upon the U.S. experience of\rblacks/whites because this experience has been so central to U.S. development\rand because the black/white social structure has been a model for how racism\rwas applied to other non-white and inferior white races in the U.S.  \rOur focus on race develops a sociological and historical analysis of race as a\rsocial structural relationship that entails social practices and ideology.  We\rbegin by an analysis of the 19th century pseudo-scientific biology of race, and\rcontrast those ideas with the current biological and anthropological criticism\rof the 19th conceptualization in order to emphasize the race relation as a\rsocial construction, i.e., a product of political, social and economic history.\r Then we examine and theorize the origins of slavery, the origins of racism,\rthe development of caste, and the civil rights movement.  We analyze how the\rsocial structure of race-as-status forms and how it sheds and acquires meanings\rin response to: the developing economy, the needs of dominant classes, the\ractions of the state, the status hungers of subordinate white classes, and the\rsocial struggles of subordinate groups, mainly blacks.                     \rWe compare the experience of African Americans with the experience of Jews and\rItalians who were perceived as inferior white races at the turn of the 20th\rcentury, but who, in the post-WWII period, become “white” ethic groups. \rFinally, we examine both the persistence and moderation of race and racism\rsince the Civil Rights movement with a special focus on the labor market, the\rhousing market and residential segregation, the wealth gap, and whiteness,\rincluding white race projects and white privilege.  \r\rOur goal is to teach students how the relationship and practice of race is\rsocially constructed over time, and to teach the differences between race and\rbiology, race and ethnicity, and race and class.  \r\rThe second part of the course focuses upon and theorizes ethnicity as a\rchanging process affected by the interaction of sub-cultural groups with\rsurrounding social institutions.  Assimilation/ resistance to assimilation is\rour central problematic.   We examine aspects of the immigration and ethnic\rdevelopment of the late 19th and early 20th century and the sociological theory\rused to account for ethnicity and assimilation.  We examine a new sociological\rtheory of assimilation that incorporates and revises the older sociological\rtheory and is primarily a response to the “new” immigrations that begin around\r1970.                   We compare the social conditions faced by the descendants of\rearly and\rnew immigrants as well as how their ideas and values changed and are changing. \r   We compare the experience of the second generation of three different “new”\rethnic groups and how their assimilation rates are  affected by the diverse\rsocial, human and financial capital of their immigrant parents, U.S. laws and\rpolitical institutions, and U.S. capitalism in the light of a globalized\reconomy, the ease of international transportation and communication, and their\rnon-whiteness.                    \r\rOur goal is to enable students to reflect upon the changing nature of ethnicity\rand why groups assimilate at different rates, the changing nature of theory in\rrelation to new experience, and, given the ethnic diversity of QC, we want to\rprovide students with some tools to reflect upon their own experience.	3	\N	Sociology 101 or Anthropology 101	t	Every Semester	None	3	35	 Ethnic and Race Relations

What follows is a model that can be modified.\r\rThe course will develop the kinds of tools for analyzing texts that are\ressential for directors, designers and actors. It will accomplish this by,\ramong other things, combining the approaches of such theorists of the theatre\ras Aristotle, Stanislavsky and Brecht with approaches to textual analysis\rtaught in departments of language and literature.\r\rStudents will use their new analytic tools to identify motifs_based on\rrecurrent images, phrases, ideas, events, character types--that give a work its\rcoherence and allow directors to develop a production concept. Students will go\rbeyond the basics of plot, character and theme to discover those aspects of a\rplay that are not immediately apparent, yet are essential to understanding the\rwork. They will test their analytic tools on a wide range of dramatic\rliterature drawn from many times and cultures, and discover both the utility\rand limitations of the tools_learning something about experimental methods\rthrough studying the arts.\r\rThe course will attempt to counter both anti-literary and anti-theatrical\rprejudices. The first treats a dramatic text as the mere plaything of visionary\rdirectors; the second regards performance as a doomed attempt to render the\rpoetic soul of a great drama in frail actorly flesh.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	1 to 2	30	 Introduction to Play and Performance

Selections will include such comparisons as Richard II\rand Marlowe’s Edward II; Shakespeare’s Richard III and Marlowe’s Dr.\rFaustus; Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice and Marlowe’s The Jew of Malta,\rand Shakespeare’s violent Titus Andronicus.  During this half of the semester\rstudents will have the opportunity to handle Elizabethan text by performing\rmonologues and scenes from the above plays.\r\rThe second half of the semester will familiarize the students with\rElizabethan society and the issues facing the playwrights who wrote during that\rera.  Using the Reacting to the Past pedagogy in a role-play situation designed\rby Professor Eric Mallin, ( Marlowe and Shakespeare, 1592), the class will be\rdivided into three groups: The Lord Strange’s Men (led by Richard Burbage), a\rtroupe that performs Shakespeare’s plays; The Lord Admiral’s Men (led by\rEdward Alleyn),known for performing Marlowe’s plays, and Queen Elizabeth’s\rPrivy Council (historical figures who advise Her Majesty).  Each student will\rresearch and assume the role of a specific figure of the time. We will\rset up a contest between the two troupes, who, by means of oral and written\rarguments gleaned from a variety of primary and secondary documents, as well as\rperformances of key scenes, attempt to persuade the Privy Council to select\reither The Jew of Malta or Titus Andronicus to be produced at Henslowe’s Rose\rTheatre in 1592. \r\rRole-play is a theatrical technique used by many disciplines in order\rto allow students to “walk a mile in the moccasins” of another being.  In\rtheir Renaissance roles, students will experience firsthand the dangerous\rpolitical atmosphere of the time, the difficulties faced by the playwrights in\rskirting the censors, and the reception their work was given by ordinary\rpeople as well as those in authority.  They will learn about the class system\rand find the place of their characters within it.   Twenty-first century actors\rwill learn how unimportant they become in a society ruled by a powerful\rmonarch, one in which they need the protection of members of the nobility to\rsurvive in their lowly profession.  Through their reading of primary documents\r(such as letters, royal proclamations, playbills, handbooks, treatises),\rstudents will compare and contrast life in the Renaissance with their\rcontemporary points of view. They will need to filter their way of thinking\rthrough the lens of the English Renaissance. In 1592 London, how do performers\rand playwrights achieve success? How has this situation changed today both in\rour country and abroad?	3	\N	None	f	Every Spring	None	1	25	 Theatrical Texts and Times

More specifically it is concerned with several\rareas of “classical physics,” which were developed between 16th and 20th\rcenturies and which deal with objects that are not too small, and that are not\rmoving too fast. In this class students will learn the basic concepts (motion,\rgravity, energy, temperature, etc.) and methods used by physicists in\rexplaining properties of the natural world. They will find out how discoveries\rin physics not only provided civilization with knowledge, but also shaped and\rchanged it. \r        Interaction between students and teaching staff is organized in the\rform of three components: lectures, recitations and labs.  Students learn\rmaterial, however, not only during scheduled class times, but also during their\rpreparation for classes. The preparation includes: reading a textbook and\radditional reading materials, solving homework problems, and performing other\rassignments deemed necessary by an instructor.\rMain goal of lectures is to deliver main conceptual content of the studied\rmaterial. Organization of lectures depends on individual styles of professors\rteaching the course, but active involvement of students in discussion of the\rsubject matter will always be one of the main means of achieving this goal. \rRecitations play a more technical role: during recitations students sharpen\rtheir practical skill in applying new concepts to typical situations occurring\rin real life or during scientific inquiry. The emphasis will be to hone problem\rsolving skills and to logically break down a complicated problem.\rDuring labs, students are introduced to and obtain hands-on experience of\rempirical methods of scientific inquiry. They learn to design meaningful\rscientific experiments, use basic measuring devices and instruments, collect\rand analyze experimental data to make reasonable scientific inferences and\rfinally discuss their results and reasons for errors.\r        Topics in this class include: \rMechanics: Kinematics (description of motion); projectile motion in everyday\rphenomena and in the history of physics, Newton’s laws as the foundation of a\rmechanical world view; Newton’s law of universal gravity and its implications\rfor astronomy, and space exploration; momentum and its conservation, kinematics\rof collisions; mechanical energy and its conservation, general concept of\renergy and its application in physics and beyond; rotational motion, torque,\renergy of rotation; oscillatory motion and simple harmonic motion; fluids\rmotion.\rHeat and thermodynamics: Thermal expansion; phases of matter and conversions;\rtemperature scales;  thermodynamic processes (isothermal, isobaric, isochoric,\radiabatic); internal energy and the 1st law of thermodynamics; 2nd law of\rthermodynamics and heat engines; thermodynamics and industrial revolution;\rentropy.	4	\N	Trigonometry and Algebra, High School Math	t	Every Semester	None	5	24	 General Physics I

How does social\rwelfare\rpolicy\rshape the character of a citizen?  Can social welfare policy effectively\rpromote equality?  What constitutes good social policy; does empirical evidence\rprove the efficacy of policy approaches, or are there broader theoretical\rquestions that define effectiveness?  To answer these questions, this course\rtraces the philosophical, economic, political and historic tributaries that\rshaped the United States’ social welfare system.  Students will gain an\runderstanding of the interplay of these factors, and how the contours of\rcontemporary social policy continue to illustrate this complex weave of\rphilosophical, economic, political and historic events.   \r\r The first large-scale challenge to social welfare policy occurred with the\rimmigration of 1845.  We will examine the settlement house movement in Chicago\rby reading Jane Adams’s book, The Spirit of Youth and The City Streets.  Class\rreading will also focus on Jacob Riis’s parallel account of New York City’s\rimmigrant experience.  \r\rThe class will define the evolution of government’s role in social welfare by\rfocusing first on Al Smith’s important influence as a ward boss from the Lower\rEast Side of New York City, to the governorship of New York, and finally to the\rnational stage as a candidate for the presidency.  Then we will discuss the\rcritical impact of Franklin Roosevelt’s policies as governor of New York and\rlater as president.  These policies had a far reaching impact in building a\rfederal role for social welfare.   \r\rExamining Post-WW II America, the class will analyze how government policies of\rthe late 1940’s and 1950’s contributed to prosperity for many Americans, but at\rthe same time, as Michael Harrington posited, these strategies created serious\r”social deficits” for southern blacks, displaced industrial workers and the\relderly.  The Great Society sought to redress these “social deficits,” but\rseveral theorists argued that the strategies developed to ameliorate the\rproblems did not achieve that goal. We will examine the empirical evidence used\rto evaluate these programs to discern what some of the failures were.  This\rexamination formed the basis for the welfare reform overall of 1994. \r\rThe last part of the course will define the current social welfare challenges\rposed in the 21st Century.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	2	35	 Social Welfare as a Social Institution

From fundamental\rgnoseological perspective the study of electrodynamics and optics exposes\rstudents to first steps in still continuing quest for common causes and a\runified description of apparently unrelated phenomena. The idea of unity of\rnature emerged as a main scientific theme of last two centuries as a result of\runification of electricity and magnetism into electrodynamics, and reducing\roptics to electromagnetism.

It examines acting, playwriting, design and production, directing, the\ruse of dramatic literature in performance, and scholarly aspects including\rcriticism and history. Students will be guided to develop an appreciation of\rthe many collaborative elements essential in the creation, production, and\rcriticism of theatrical events. \r        The field of theatre requires knowledge of antecedent theatrical\rpractices to understand form and practice of a play within its original culture\rand to provide a basis for re-crafting it for a contemporary audience.\rTherefore students will be introduced to historical practices of dramaturgy,\rstaging, and assessment of aesthetics.\r        Theatre is based in the knowledge and skill of crafting form.\rTherefore, a variety of techniques (acting exercises, shop experience in\rtheatrical building of sets and costumes, project assignments of staging\rscenes, etc) will be introduced to guide in understanding and appreciating the\rdevelopment of presentational form.\r        The processes of crafting and analyzing performance require a critical\runderstanding of the relationship between the performer and the audience.\rStudents will learn that theatrical techniques can teach us about different\rcultures and different time periods as they develop a critical approach towards\rthe viewing of theatrical events.\r\rCourse Objectives:\r\rUpon completion of DRTH 001, students should accomplish the following\robjectives to: \r1.            Achieve a basic understanding of theatrical performance and its\rposition as a synthesis of many arts_playwriting, acting, directing, design,\rmusic, and dance_leading to a better understanding, interpretation, and\revaluation of creative works. \r2.            Engage in critical and useful participation in theatre, as either a\rthinking member of the audience, or as a participant in the art itself both\rduring the course and after its completion.\r3.            Develop aesthetic sensibilities that expand understanding of\rartistic\rform.\r4.            Recognize the benefits and possibilities for continued cultural\rengagement throughout life through exposure to the theatrical arts in this\rcourse’s classroom activities and through participation as an audience member\rin live theatre. \r5.            Improve communication skills through viewing, thinking, talking,\rand\rwriting critically about theatrical events. \r6.            Increase sensitivity to the values of others through exposure to\rdiverse opinions in both reading dramatic literature and watching plays, and in\rclass discussions on those issues.\r7.            Develop skills in problem solving through analysis of, discussions\rabout, and participation in group projects on theatrical texts and\rperformances. \r8.            Develop skills to cooperatively work in groups through efforts in\rgroup\rprojects and discussions, and participation in the social and collaborative\rexperience of live theatre. \r9.   Examine personal interests, talents, and goals through exposure to and    \r    participation in the wide range of experiences inherent in theatrical\rpresentation.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	8	40-50	 Introduction to Drama and Theatre

There will be a\rnumber of short papers or exercises, which are intended to give experience in\rparticular research skills.  The assignments may be thought of as stages in a\rresearch project.  The first assignment will be to identify a particular social\rscience research topic that interests you, one that you may have always been\rcurious about, and would like to learn more about.  You should hand in a one\rpage account of your topic early in the semester.  The next step is to explore\rthe literature on your topic.  For this assignment, we will have two workshop\rcomputer lab sessions to help you use bibliographic resources. The result will\rbe an annotated bibliography.  The next step is to do a careful reading of the\rmost important literature relevant to your topic and to write a review of the\rmost important findings. The final project will be to write a research proposal\rin which you restate your research topic, and propose a plan for research to\rgather data to shed light on a specific aspect of your topic.  There will also\rbe a midterm exam and a final exam.   Along the way, we will have a number of\rshort exercises to give you hands-on experience with some of the skills and\ranalytic techniques we will use.	3	\N	Sociology 101	t	Every Semester	None	9	25	 Social Analysis

Not only is\rlinguistic behavior the central focus of many social settings, but it is also\ron linguistic evidence that we base many of our evaluations of the world around\rus. Yet attitudes towards language and the ways in which we use language are\rhighly dependent on social and cultural factors.

It aims to address commonly held misconceptions about\rlanguage as well as important issues such as appreciation of diversity,\rmulticulturalism, language policies, ethics and social justice.  Discussions on\rthe sociocultural significance of language will be held by addressing such\rquestions as:  To what extent does language shape our thoughts and identities? \rWhat does it mean to know a language?

A\rproposal that ACE 015 be approved as a PLAS course is being submitted\rseparately.\r\r     In line with the description, instructors in ACE 016 typically assign,\rfirst, chapters in a history of Western civilization that deal with the\rReformation, the commercial revolution, the rise of national states, the\rscientific revolution, the Enlightenment (including the American Revolution),\rthe French Revolution, Napoleon, the industrial revolution, currents of thought\rin the early nineteenth century (such as romanticism, conservatism, liberalism,\rradicalism, socialism, and nationalism), the revolutions and counterrevolutions\rin nineteenth-century Continental European states, currents of thought in the\rmiddle and later nineteenth century (such as realism in art and literature,\rpositivism, Darwinism, Marxism, anarchism, and feminism), the unifications of\rItaly and Germany, and the rise of extreme nationalism leading to World War I. \r(This is as far into “modern times” as instructors in ACE 016 usually find\rit feasible to get, though some occasionally try to get as far as the eve of\rWorld War II.)                    \r\rIn the second place, also assigned, in whole or in significant part, will be\rpertinent sources both primary and secondary, in history, philosophy,\rsociology, political theory, social psychology, and economics, such as the\rfollowing: Weber’s Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,\rHobbes’s Leviathan, Locke’s Second Treatise of Civil Government,\rRousseau’s Social Contract, Mill’s On Liberty and On the Subjection of\rWomen, Freud’s Civilization and Its Discontents, and Heilbroner’s Worldly\rPhilosophers: The Lives, Times, and Ideas of the Great Economic Thinkers (from\rAdam Smith to Keynes and Schumpeter).

They will\rlearn how to collect appropriate data to meet standards of validity and\rreliability, and perform a basic analysis of that data. They will end by\rreporting their findings and conclusions to the class. A classic type of\rsociolinguistic project that can be used in the course involves correlating the\ruse of linguistic (dependent) variable(s) involving pronunciation, morphology,\rsyntax, or vocabulary with social (independent) variables. Students formulate\rresearch questions by deciding on which social variables (i.e., race, age,\rgender, class, geographic roots, and national identity) they wish to explore.\rThey then investigate their questions, by collecting, analyzing and\rinterpreting data as they relate to their RQ(s), and write up their results.\rStudents are carefully guided through each step of this process until their\rproject’s completion.	3	\N	None	f	Every Semester	None	1	30	 Language and Social Diversity

This course will introduce students to elements of\rmusic and they will also learn listening skills that apply to all genres and\rstuyles.  These skills and knowledge will be put into practice through\rattendance at live performances of music of a variety of cultures and in a\rvariety of venues in Manhattan and the outer boroughs.                               \r\r\rStudents will be introduced to prior writing and thought about\rmusic by critics and musicians knowledgeable about the respective performance\rtraditions as primary sources. The instructor will also put the musical\rtraditions in the context of the cultures from which they came and the\rassociated cultural and liberal arts traditions.  The goal will be to teach the\rstudents to listen to, and to think and write critically about the performances\rthey hear in their cultural context.  The instructor would lead the class in\rgroup discussions following each concert to facilitate this process.               \r                     \r\rAfter exploring the basic elements of music and listening skills, students will\rattend a variety of concerts from three broadly defined traditions: 1) Western\rClassical Music; 2) Jazz and Popular Western Music; 3) non-Western indigenous\rtraditions.   At least one concert in the last category\rwould ideally be chosen from a tradition represented by one or more members of\rthe students in the course.  In some cases the music might accompany dance\rperformances, and the instructor could decide to what extent the relationship\rbetween the music and the dance it accompanies should be taken into\rconsideration in cultural context.\r\rStudents will attend performances at a variety of venues: Lincoln Center;\rLeFrak Concert Hall; Louis Armstrong House and Museum; 92nd St. Y; Bargemusic;\rLe Poisson Rouge; Flushing town Hall; Carnegie Hall; Weill Recital Hall; Paul\rHall (Juilliard School); Asia Society; Tenri Cultural Institute; the Blue Note;\rBirdland; Iridium; Jazz at Lincoln Center, etc.	3	\N	Students should have sophomore standing or by permission of instructor	t	Every Fall	None	1	35	 Music Performance in New York (VT)

29	29X-H3F4F6J1F8	919	101	never	Joe Rollins	2008-11-05	5-Nov-08	Political Science 101 is designed to introduce students to the discipline\ritself and therefore approaches its subject matter broadly.  The discipline is\rtraditionally subdivided into the following categories:  American Politics\r(AP), International Relations (IR), Comparative Politics (CP), and Political\rTheory (PT).  In most departments, each of these subfields is further divided\rto  focus on specific institutions and methods. For example, AP is normally\rcomprised of the following: The Presidency, Congress, Courts/Public Law, Public\rAdministration and Public Policy, State and Local Government; CP breaks down by\rregion of the globe. Because the discipline also splits between scholars with\rdifferent methodological talents and interests (i.e., quantitative or\rqualitative), an introduction to the discipline, such as PS101, is, by\rnecessity, interdisciplinary, satisfies multiple PLAS goals, and will change\remphasis depending upon the instructor.  All iterations of the course, however,\rwill touch upon textual exegesis as well as qualitative research, and introduce\rstudents to the building blocks of quantitative reasoning.  This latter element\rwill, in most instances, be as basic as instructing students on the basic\relements of logic (e.g., the rhetorical strategy commonly used in legal\ropinions), or, in other instances, students will be introduced to the\rfundamentals of research design (e.g., formulating research questions, thinking\rabout how to answer those questions, how to gather the information required,\rand how to draw analytic conclusions from the material collected).  These\relements of the course are intended to introduce students to the theoretical,\rabstract reasoning, and quantitative methods of the discipline.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	6	40	 Introduction to Political Science

21	21X-C4A4J0G4I2	846	101	always	Christopher Winks	2008-09-03	3-Sep-08	Among the distinctive contributions of the always open and diversified field of\rComparative Literature to a liberal education has been its emphasis on what has\rbeen called the “worlding” of literature, the various ways in which literature\rhelps us to see and understand the world we live in and its multiple pasts,\rpresents, and futures, and on the importance of textual analysis and\rtranslation as communicating vessels between languages and cultures.  This\rcourse and its companion, Global Literatures II, aim to provide students with a\rgreater awareness of the global cultural contexts in which literary works are\rcreated (which is intended to enhance rather than diminish consideration of the\raesthetic qualities of these texts).  The course draws its assigned readings\rfrom ancient times to the early modern period (a period spanning the 3rd\rmillennium BCE to the early 16th century CE).  It may include both written and\roral materials, with a focus on the plurality (and where possible the\rintersections and interactions) of ancient and pre-modern worlds: Greece and\rRome, China and India, the global Middle Ages, the empires of North and West\rAfrica, the Renaissance and the pre-Columbian world.\r\rThis is intended to be a variable-topics course and its instructor(s) will have\rbroad leeway to shape its content and emphases, while preserving a\rcross-cultural, comparative orientation that situates the selected texts in the\rwider world(s) of their marking.  Sample topics could be: From Orature to\rLiterature, The Epic, Love in the Ancient World, Monotheisms and Polytheisms,\rLiterature of Empire, Representations of the Individual, Poetry of Antiquity,\retc.\r\rSample Topic:\r\rVisions and Versions of Antiquity.  What is termed the “ancient world” has\rconventionally been equated with “the Greeks and the Romans,” following a\rparadigm that tends to relegate the vast rest of the globe to a peripheral\rstatus.  This course proposes a broader focus that, while acknowledging the\rimmense contributions of Greece and Rome, explores as well examples of the\rliteratures of ancient Egypt, China, and India; medieval Persia and West\rAfrica; and Mesoamerica after the Spanish Conquest (a tragic milestone in the\rforging of what we call the “modern” era).  As we read and discuss these often\rfragmentary readings (which parallel our own often fragmentary understanding of\rthe worlds that shaped them), we will consider not only their immediate\rhistorical and cultural contexts, but also their continuing resonance across\rtime, place, and language.	3	\N	English 110	t	Every Semester	None	6 to 10	25	 Global Literatures I

At its most general, the subfield introduces students to these\rconcepts through comparative analysis whereby their own “orientalism” is\rdestabilized by looking at the differences among political systems in\rhistorical, cultural and political contexts; hence, the term “comparative.” \rTraditional approaches to the area emphasize the influence of players from\rthree levels of analysis:  historical (economic modernization and political\rdevelopment), cultural (political cultures and socialization), and structural\r(party systems, government institutions).  Faculty trained in CP specialize in\rparticular geographic areas (e.g., the Middle East, Latin America, Asia) and\rthus all courses are, by definition, comparative and concerned with world\rcultures. The attached sample syllabus emphasizes the theoretical elements of\rCP and apply these to the study of countries across three worlds: early\rdevelopers, late developers and developing countries (the Global North, Global\rEast and Global South).  Other faculty in the Political Science Department rely\ron the same theories and concepts, but may apply them to different regions of\rthe globe.  The methods favored by the subfield of CP are two:                       \r     \r\rqualitative and\rquantitative.  Qualitative analytic strategies inform students about the\rhistorical evolution of political forms, sources of political change and\rbehavior, and structures and functions of institutional features.  The\rquantitative aspect of CP relies primarily on economic modeling and game theory\rin order to provide students with a more comprehensive, linear, set of analytic\rtools for exploring change and development in their world.	3	\N	None	t	Every Semester	None	1	55	 Introduction to Comparative Politics

Three themes dominate\rthis effort. First, who or what makes international politics? Within states,\rwho or what makes foreign policy? For non-state actors, what organizations,\rindividuals, or structures dominate policymaking? Second, what are the goals of\rthe actors in international politics?

Cultural anthropology addresses and attempts to explicate\rcultural, social, religious, economic, political and other characteristics and\rsystems of societies from various parts of the world.  In other words,\ranthropology is, at base, a discipline concerned with what it is to be human\rand students are expected to develop the ability to examine social phenomena\rfrom a cross-cultural point of view while developing critical perspectives on\rtheir own culture(s). Over the course of the semester we therefore concentrate\ron theory and methods related to approaches to human unity and diversity, with\rsome attention to language as developed in linguistic anthropology. Readings\rtypically include three to four ethnographies, (an ethnography is a written\rdescription and often analysis of a community, institution, or group of people\rin which data is obtained through firsthand field research).  Some instructors\ralso include a coursepack which contains articles and primary source documents.\r\rAs becomes apparent to students as a result of the diversity of ethnographies\rread, anthropology is a diverse field concerned with values, social structures,\rattempts to find meaning in a complex universe, and, especially, with human\rvariability across space and time. Lectures and readings are intended to help\rstudents become aware that anthropology is not simply the study of primitive,\rsimple, or marginal peoples but rather a way of seeing, being in, and\rrepresenting a world constantly in transition even it may also be united by\rcertain shared traits and experiences.
