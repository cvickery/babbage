<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Persistent Java Virtual Machine (PJVM) project began as an
  attempt to reduce the overhead involved in the compile-test-edit
  cycle during the development of Java applications.  The idea was to
  keep a single JVM "alive" across iterations of the development cycle
  in order to eliminate the overhead of loading and initializing a new
  JVM during each time.  An analogy would be the use of the "++" option
  with IBM's Jikes compiler, which keeps the compiler process running,
  with automatic recompilation of only those source files that have
  changed when the user presses the Enter key.  Similarly with PJVM:
  only those classes that have been modified would need to be reloaded
  into the jvm during an iteration of the development cycle.</p>

  <p>But in developing the PJVM facility, we soon realized that the
  tool we are developing is far more useful than simply a mechanism for
  streamlining the development cycle.  Java's "Reflection Mechanism,"
  which is a key feature needed to support PJVM, provides both
  professional and student developers and with key insights about the
  structure and operation of code running in the JVM environment. Using
  the PJVM interface, the user can not only create JVMs and load
  classes into them, but also instantiate classes, invoke methods, and
  get lists of objects, methods and classes currently residing in each
  JVM.  Right now, PJVM is not a full-featured debugger, but with the
  addition of standard debugging facilities for tracing code will, we
  think, make PJVM the development platform of choice for serious Java
  developers.</p>

<h2>PJVM Structure</h2>

  <p>PJVM currently consists of three modules, which we call the
  server, the user manager, and a set of clients.  The three modules
  run as independent processes that communicate with each other by
  passing messages over standard TCP/IP stream sockets.</p>

  <p>A single host (local or remote) normally runs a single server
  process, which may be thought of as a standard Unix daemon process. 
  Its job is to create all the JVMs for that host, regardless of how
  many different users might be using that host for development.  Each
  JVM runs in it's own process independent of all others running on the
  same host.  The server uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) mechanism
  to launch each JVM in response to a request from one of the manager
  processes.</p>

  <p>Each user runs a background manager process for the duration of a
  development session.  Each manager process keeps track of the JVMs
  that the user has created, locally and/or remotely.  The manager
  process acts as the intermediary between a server and the client
  processes that the user invokes to interact with the PJVM development
  environment.  The manager process may at first seem like unnecessary
  overhead, since PJVM client applications could in principle
  communicate with jvm processes directly.  The per-user manager
  processes, however, keep track of the communication parameters for
  each PJVM, simplifying the user's interactions with the clients.</p>

  <p>When a PJVM server starts, it listens for manager requests on its
  well-known socket (specified as a command-line option or as an entry
  in /etc/services).  A user then launches a manager process, typically
  to run as a background job.  If a user then issues client commands to
  manipulate persistent JVMs.  For example, the requestjvm command
  creates a new persistent JVM for the user if possible.  The user's
  manager process keeps track of the communication port for each PJVM
  created so that subsequent commands, to load classes, etc. can refer
  to JVMs using small index numbers.  The manager processes also
  isolate users from one another in a shared server environment.</p>

<h2>PJVM Project Development</h2>

  <p>Our primary development environment is Linux, but we have
  endeavored to make sure all our code adheres to POSIX standards so it
  can easily be ported to other Unix systems as well as other operating
  systems that claim POSIX compatibility, such as Windows XP/2000.</p>

  <p>We have been using the Sun JVM for our work, with Sun's current
  JDK providing the JNI and Reflection class libraries.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

  <p>We currently have developed and tested initial versions of the
  server and manager processes, and have implemented commands for
  creating, listing, and deleting jvms, and for loading class files
  into individual jvms and listing them.  Previous work has verified
  that we can instantiate classes, invoke methods, pass objects as
  parameters to static and instance methods, etc.  We are in the
  process of writing a suite of commands to perform these operations as
  well.  The commands are designed to use standard I/O facilities in
  such a way that pipelines and I/O redirection will be able to link
  commands together either through scripts or interactive invocation. 
  For example, using POSIX shell notation for command substitution
  (i.e., $(...) instead of `...`), one could create a new JVM, load
  class Foo into it, and invoke Foo's main() method using a command
  line something like the following:</p>

<pre>
    $ invokemethod $(loadclass Foo $(requestjvm) ) hello world
</pre>

  <p>With the command line interface developed, we next plan to
  implement a GUI version that frees the user from some of the arcane
  aspects of command line scripting.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

  <p>As currently implemented, each JVM creates over a dozen processes
  on Linux systems.  (We are aware of
  <a
  href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/library/java2/index.html">work
  at IBM DevleoperWorks</a>, which discusses the impact of Linux'
  threading model on Java applications.)  This issue will need to be
  resolved if we hope to deploy PJVM on large timesharing systems, such
  as the one used for student accounts at Queens College, since a few
  dozen concurrent users could have a serious impact on the number of
  available processes on the system.</p>

  <p>Currently, PJVM provides user access to information only about
  those classes loaded and those objects created by PJVM commands.  But
  to make the system most useful, the classloader needs to be augmented
  to enable PJVM also to track classes loaded and objects created as a
  result of code executed by the user's applications.  There are
  technical matters here that we need to explore before proceeding with
  this issue.</p>

  <p>As mentioned above, we need to augment the PJVM system with the
  ability to trace the execution of methods invoked directly or
  indirectly from the user interface, including the ability to
  single-step, set breakpoints, and other standard debugging
  features.</p>

  <p>Also as mentioned above, we need to provide a graphical user
  interface to maximize user productivity.</p>

<h2>Past and Future Support</h2>

  <p>The PJVM project has benefitted from a grant from CISDD (CUNY
  Institute for Software Design and Development), which has financed
  some of the coding and has provided a development system for the
  project.</p>
  
  <p>We have applied to the City University of New York's PSC-CUNY
  awards program for funding to further development of this
  project.</p>
