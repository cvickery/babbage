Colleagues:

  We need to receive just three things from you for the
  self-study:

    1.  An up-to-date CV.  Be sure it indicates the date of
    appointment to your current title.

    2.  Please note (up to) five publications that you feel
    are particularly representative of the body of your
    work.

    3.  Please prepare brief statements (1-2 sentences) of
    your (a) teaching and (b) research specialization.

    Please send these to me by email by next Thursday, April
    21.  The CV should be an attachment in PDF, PS, or DOC
    format.  The other two items should be in the body of
    the email message.

  Also, there is a draft version of the survey for students
  and alumni ready for everyone to review and comment on.
  The easiest way to get to it is to go to the self study
  web page and follow the link you'll find there.  The self
  study web page is at:

    Thanks,
