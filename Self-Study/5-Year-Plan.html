<H2>Future of Department for Next Five to Seven Years</H2>
<P><I>Describe and analyze, from the point of view of the
department&rsquo;s faculty, the department's strengths and
weaknesses, proposed changes, and other areas of concern. Special
attention should be given to issues regarding faculty recruitment and
retention, especially with regard to women and minorities, as
recruitment often plays a vital role in the future of the department,
to the extent that it is usually more convenient to first discuss the
five-to-seven-year future of the department and the specific actions,
particularly the recruitment of new faculty, needed to achieve that
future. Note that a clear formulation of the department&rsquo;s
mission statement in Section 1 will greatly facilitate the discussion
here of the department&rsquo;s future.</I></P>
<P>As &ldquo;the&rdquo; technology department at the college,
Computer Science attracts many students who pursue their
undergraduate education with a quite limited, career-oriented
objective: to prepare themselves for their first job. This is an
unfortunate situation because it does not match the department&rsquo;s
own mission, which is to integrate today's digital technologies into
a well-rounded liberal arts education. Nonetheless, the situation
exists, and it leads to rather large cyclical fluctuations in our
enrollments as the perceived employability of computer scientists
fluctuates with socioeconomic conditions affecting the technology
sector of the economy. At the present time, we are at a low point in
the number of students majoring or minoring in our department
following the dot-com bubble burst of 2002 and subsequent concerns
about off-shoring of programming jobs. Thus, our plans for the next
few years must be made in this context, and need to address its
implications. What can we do to stabilize our cyclical enrollment
patterns? What can we do to prepare for the next wave? And most
importantly, what can we do to provide better integration of our
curriculum with the needs of Queens College students, not just
Computer Science majors, in an era where a solid mastery of
technological issues and trends is expected of all members of
society?</P>
<H3>Stabilizing Enrollment</H3>
<P>Historically (if one can speak historically of the youngest
department in the Natural Sciences!), computer science has been a
&ldquo;big major,&rdquo; with around sixty credits of required
courses, and a &ldquo;big department,&rdquo; with the fourth largest
number of majors at the college in 2003, the most recent year for
which comparative data are available. However from 2001 to 2004 our
FTEs dropped by close to 40%. But we know that technological skills
are a critical element in the educational fabric of our times, and we
have every reason to believe that our current enrollments are the low
point in a cyclic process.</P>
<P>There are three fronts for dealing with the issue of enrollment
cycles: curriculum, staffing, and (for lack of a better term)
marketing.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in">The computer science major is
objectively large, and is generally perceived to be difficult. It is
large because of the complexity of the subject matter, and difficult
because mastery tends be be bimodal: either you work hard and &ldquo;get
it,&rdquo; or you might as well not bother to try. The minor is a
proper subset of the major, so it too is not something that can be
pursued casually.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in">The content and structure of the major
is highly structured and largely dictated by norms developed by
professional societies in the field and other academic institutions.
So, except for the normal process of refinement and evolution, the
major is not going to change much for the next five to seven years.
However, the department also offers several courses specifically
designed for non-majors, and we see programs for non-majors not only
as a way of dampening the fluctuations in our FTEs, but also as a way
of recruiting well-qualified students to pursue the major.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in">One popular set of courses for
non-majors can be thought of as basic skills courses: the use of
office skills like word processing, spreadsheets, and simple web page
design. We use our understanding of computer science principles to
infuse these courses with sound principles of algorithmic thinking
and development of realistic technological models as much as we can.
As students arrive at the college with better and better
technological backgrounds, these course evolve to include more
advanced topics, but by their nature they will never become &ldquo;real&rdquo;
computer science courses because they do not require the mathematical
background of even the most elementary courses in the computer
science major and minor. Nonetheless, keeping these courses up to
date and relevant to the &ldquo;real world&rdquo; provides us with a
mechanism for attracting students to the department.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in">An possible option would be to expand
our curriculum into other computer-related disciplines mentioned in
the  introduction to this report: Computer Engineering, Information
Technology, Software Engineering, or Information Systems.  Perhaps by
averaging our enrollment across several majors we could stablize the
total number of students we teach.  We feel this would be a risky
approach requiring changes that are too radical for the department to
undertake.  While our present curriculum overlaps with several of
these other disciplines (notably software engineering and computer
engineering), but we would require many more faculty lines to be able
to offer full majors in any of these other areas, and we would still
be faced with cyclic demand among the majors, leading to inevitable
imbalances between the areas we cover and the interests of the
students.  Furthermore, we feel strongly that computer science is the
most appropriate program for providing technology-centric education
in a liberal arts college such as Queens.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.3in">However, we do see courses for
non-majors as an attractive vehicle for stabilizing our enrollment
base while attracting good students into the major.  To this end, we
see specialized minors as a way of expanding this approach.  For
example, we are experimenting with a (&ldquo;web services&rdquo;?)
minor that will provide instruction in the design and deployment of
internet-based applications.  While courses in this minor could be
taught from an Information Technology perspective stressing the use
of commercial tools, our courses will stress design principles and
realistic models based on algorithmic problem-solving.  We are
hopeful that this minor will be seen by students as relevant and
stimulating while also motivating some of them to dig deeper by
taking courses in the major.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.31in">An unfortunate side effect of cyclical
enrollment patterns is that the number of full-time faculty tends to
lag the number needed to meet student demands.  Some of this lag can
be handled by having a relatively small number of full-time faculty
and a fluctuating body of adjuncts to fill the slack as demand waxes
and wanes.  While we are fortunate to have several excellent adjunct
faculty members, relying on adjuncts in general leads to serious
problems of quality control and management.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.31in">For the next one or two years, we
would like to maintain approximately the current number of full-time
faculty.  There should be new hires during this period because of
normal attrition from the current ranks of the department, and this
is a time for us to be sure we continue to have a good balance of
people whose interests cover the core areas of computer science:
software, hardware, and theory.  But we also anticipate increased
enrollments ...</P>

<P><I>Hopefully, by increasing non-major enrollments, we'll have less
of a bump when the major becomes hot again.  Plan to start ramping up
