<I>
        I love my master;
        Thus I perfume myself with
        This long-rotten squirrel.


        I lie belly-up
        In the sunshine, happier than
        You ever will be.


        Today I sniffed
        Many dog butts-I celebrate
        By kissing your face.
        
        
        I sound the alarm!
        Paperboy-come to kill us all-
        Look! Look! Look!
        
        
        I sound the alarm!
        Mailman Fiend-come to kill us all-
        Look! Look! Look!
        
        
        I sound the alarm!
        Meter reader-come to kill us all-
        Look! Look! Look!
        
        
        I sound the alarm!
        Garbage man-come to kill us all-
        Look! Look! Look!
        
        
        I sound the alarm!
        Neighbor's cat-come dares to enter yard!
        Look! Look! Look!
        
        
        I lift my leg and
        Wiz on each bush. Hello, Spot -
        Sniff this and weep.

        
        How do I love thee?
        The ways are numberless as
        My hairs on the rug.


        My human is home!
        I am so ecstatic I have
        Made a puddle.


        I hate my choke chain -
        Look, world, they strangle me!
        Ack Ack Ack


        Sleeping here, my chin
        On your foot - no greater bliss - well,
        Maybe catching cats.


        Look in my eyes and
        Deny it. No human could
        Love you as much I do.


        The cat is not all
        Bad - she fills the litter box
        With Tootsie Rolls.


        Dig under fence-why?
        Because it's there. Because it's
        There. Because it's there.
        
        
        I am your best friend,
        Now, always, and especially
        When you are eating.


        You may call them fleas,
        But they are far more! I call
        Them a vocation.


        My owners' mood is
        Romantic-I lie near their
        Feet. I fart a big one.
