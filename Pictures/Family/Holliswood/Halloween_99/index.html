Here are a couple of shots of Alex dressed in the tunic and ruffled
shirt that Nancy made for him.  What you can't see is the pony tail that
goes perfectly with the outfit.  He wore it to school with his hair
sprayed black on Friday, and people didn't recognize him.<p>

The costume was definitely a joint effort between Nancy and Alex.  They
went to Fabric Bonanza together to pick out the pattern and material
without knowing ahead of time exactly what they would be doing.  The
shirt is one that Josh used when he was Robin Hood, with the frills
added for this outfit.<p>

Oh yes, you can't see the dracula teeth either ...<p>
