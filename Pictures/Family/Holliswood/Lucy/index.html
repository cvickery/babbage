<IMG ALT="Picture of Lucy" HSPACE=100 SRC="Lucy_2.jpg"><P>This is our
dog, Lucy, photographed on February 11, 1997.<P>

We picked her up at North Shore Animal League on January 4, 1997.  She
was about 8 months old when we got her, and she is a very sweet dog.
She's officially Alex's Christmas present, but we are all feeling very
much involved in making her a part of our family.<P>

<A href="Lucy_1.jpg">Here is our first picture of her</a>, taken when we first
got her.

<H2>Bennington Rules</H2>

When I was a student, the rules at Bennington College were that girls
could have male visitors in their dorm rooms, provided both parties
kept two feet on the floor.  Lucy has the same rule about the couch,
and is just as creative about adhering to the rule as those Bennington
girls were. 

<ul>
  <li><A href="Lucy_5.jpg">Just Being Friendly</a>
  <li><A href="Lucy_6.jpg">"Off the Couch" is the same as "On the
  Floor," Right?</a>
  <li><A href="Lucy_4.jpg">Well, "One on the Floor" seems pretty good to
  me.</a>
  <li><A href="Lucy_3.jpg">Innocent!</a>
</ul>
(I never did get a date with any of those Bennington girls.)
