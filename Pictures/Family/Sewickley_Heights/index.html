<H2>Easter 2000</H2>

Bill took scads of great pictures at Kristin's birthday
party and at Chris and Leigh's over Easter weekend. He
sent them to me on floppy disks, so that's how they are
organized.  Click on the links below to get to the pictures
that were on each disk.<P>

<UL>
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="2000-05-disk1">Disk 1</A>&nbsp;]
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="2000-05-disk3">Disk 3</A>&nbsp;]
  <LI>[&nbsp;<a HREF="2000-05-disk4">Disk 4</A>&nbsp;]
</UL>

<B>Contest!</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally we see pictures in the
order in which they were taken, but these are ordered
alphabetically by the names Bill used for the disk files.
For example, the first picture on disk 1 is called "alex 3",
the next one is "alex&amp;nancy", the next one is "alex2",
etc.  (Note that the space in "alex 3" makes it come before
"alex2" with no space.)  Figure out the names of the
pictures and win a prize!<P>
