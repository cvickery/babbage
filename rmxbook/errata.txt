      Real-Time and Systems Programming for PCs by Christopher Vickery.
      (McGraw-Hill, 1993).  I am offering a "bounty" of $1.00 to the

      There are two copies of this document, a plain text file
      (errata.txt) and a PostScript file (errata.ps).  The advantage of
      the latter is that it shows the desired fonts to be used as well as
      the content.

      This list was last updated on October 27, 1993.
